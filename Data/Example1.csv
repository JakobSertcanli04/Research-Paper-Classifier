The recycling of spent lithium-ion batteries has emerged as a pressing environmental concern. The regeneration of cathode materials has garnered widespread attention as the most promising approach for the recovery of lithium cobalt oxide (LCO). However, the significant impact of phase transformation layers on the regeneration efficiency of LCO has been rarely addressed. In this study, we investigated the effects of phase transformation layers on the relithiation process, demonstrating that the phase transformation layers structure impedes lithium-ion transport along its primary pathways. We further proposed using layered hydroxide oxides as structural intermediates to reconstruct the phase transformation layers on the surface of spent LCO materials. This approach mitigates the negative effects of phase transformation layers, promoting lithium-ion transport. The regenerated materials processed through this method exhibited a specific capacity after 100 cycles that was 139% of that achieved by directly regenerated materials. These results validate the method's effectiveness in enhancing the recovery efficiency and regeneration capability of spent materials.

However, it is currently unknown how their environmental impacts compare to that of LiFePO4 batteries. This study establishes a comprehensive and transparent life cycle inventory of four different types of potassium-ion batteries and presents a prospective cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment of these batteries. Potassium-ion batteries are found to be promising from a comprehensive life cycle perspective, particularly for KFeSO4F batteries. In terms of battery manufacturing, the utilization of aluminum foil as an anode collector allows the human non-carcinogenic toxicity and mineral resource scarcity values of potassium-ion batteries (except for KVPO4F batteries) to be only 15% and 24% of those of LiFePO4 batteries. However, the relatively lower energy density of potassium-ion batteries results in a less favorable performance than LiFePO4 batteries in the global warming and fossil resource scarcity categories. Furthermore, the environmental impacts for potassium-ion batteries arising from electricity losses in the use phase account for a significant portion of the entire system, contributing on average 59%, 52% and 48% to the global warming, fossil resourcing scarcity, and terrestrial acidification categories, respectively. For both potassium-ion and LiFePO4 batteries, the recovery of certain materials makes the hydrometallurgical recycling process have a positive environmental effect. Sensitivity analyses highlight the pivotal role of enhanced energy density and cycle life in the prospective advancement of potassium-ion batteries. This work provides a theoretical basis for future potassium-ion battery research. ";"2024-12-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624037478";"1";"Batteries"

The key to their electrochemical performance lies in the processes occurring at the air cathode. However, the complexity of these reactions, coupled with the by-products generated during discharge, can make the reaction process slow or impede their efficiency. This study evaluates the environmental impact of high-efficiency lithium-oxygen batteries cathodes, including titanium oxide composites, graphene-based composites and activated carbon-based composites, through a life cycle assessment across 18 impact categories using a cradle-to-gate approach with a functional unit of 25 kWh. Results show that active material production was the largest contributor to environmental impact, particularly Global Warming Potential. Among the evaluated cathodes, reduced graphene oxide/α-mnaganese oxide/palladium (rGO/α-MnO2/Pd) demonstrated the highest environmental impact, with a global warming potential of 1130.71 kg carbon dioxide from active material production, due to its energy-intensive synthesis and the use of chemicals like sulfuric acid, sodium borohydride, hydrochloric acid, and hydrogen peroxide. Additionally, the rGO/α-MnO2/Pd cathode had the highest Human Toxicity Potential and Ozone Depletion Potential. Batteries with graphene-based cathodes achieved a specific capacity of 7500 mAh.g−1, underscoring their performance potential while highlighting the need for more sustainable cathode manufacturing methods. These findings emphasize the environmental considerations necessary for large-scale lithium-oxygen batteries implementation.

These batteries, if disposed in landfill, presents concerns to the environment and human health. Moreover, end-of-life EV lithium batteries still retain a certain extent of their initial capacity. Hence, a circular economy (CE) approach has been proposed as a possible solution to overcome these challenges. Effective circular business models play a vital role for the adoption of circular practices throughout the industry considering the development of such models are context specific. Therefore, this research aims to explore and investigate context-specific factors required to develop a circular business model for end-of-life EV lithium batteries in Australia. This study applies an inductive approach drawing from themes arising from semi-structured interviews of five stakeholder groups related to the EV lithium battery industry. The level of influence of government policies, knowledge and understanding of CE, and the dependence on EU and other nations were found to influence the EV battery industry. Particularly, the findings suggest the knowledge of ‘how to be involved in CE initiatives’ was lacking and should be given importance. Therefore, the importance of collaboration not only between government and industry but also involving academics and research institutions is highlighted. Based on these contextual factors, implementing the 10R strategy relative to the prevalent 3R or 4R strategy for the development and classification of circular business models for end-of-life EV lithium batteries in Australia is suggested. Academic contributions and managerial implications followed by recommendations to policy makers are provided.";"2024-11-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624034863";"1";"Batteries"

The role of greenwashing and involvement in environmental campaigns on social media ";" While studies have focused on exploring the implications of greenwashing, specifically its impact on customer behavior, scant research has considered the origins and precursors of perceived greenwashing, especially from the perspective of customers' environmental values. This study examined links between customers' environmental beliefs, awareness of sustainable development goals (SDGs), personal responsibility, and perceived greenwashing. The study also examined the moderating role of involvement in environmental campaigns on social media on the link between perceived greenwashing and company outcomes (i.e. perceived company green value and brand attachment). Data were gathered from customers of battery products in China. Path analyses and group analyses were conducted to test hypotheses. The main findings showed that customers’ green values enhanced perceptions of greenwashing, which further reduced perceived company green value and brand attachment. The negative link between perceived greenwashing and company outcomes was stronger among customers who reported involvement in environmental campaigns on social media.

A challenging problem arises when managing different battery requirements of moving EVs through reliable Charging Stations (CSs). Current concerns for EV users are long waiting lines at CSs and dropping below a predefined battery capacity limit. For this reason, this paper proposes an Internet of Things (IoT)-based EV charging scheduling system, which with the use of IoT technologies, decides the optimal assignment between EVs and Charging Points (CPs) located at different CSs at given time t. By using cloud computing and real time data such as number of EVs, number of CSs, number of CPs at different CSs … etc; the scheduling controller uses a recursive algorithm to generate all possible scenarios, and then shares the optimal assignment (that minimizes the average waiting time and fulfill battery constraints and charging needs) with all EVs. To test the validity of the IOT based scheduling system, sensitivity analysis by running different scenarios (pertaining to different parameters) was conducted. The different scenarios were compared to a base scenario where the system was not used and real-life random assignment is considered. The different run scenarios show superiority over the base scenario in terms of average waiting time (WT) and battery capacity threshold. For example, in the base scenario, violation of battery capacity threshold occurred 9.1% of the time, making random selection an unreliable choice versus no violations when the IOT scheduling system is used. Also, all tested scenarios under the IOT scheduling system show shorter average WT compared to the base scenario. For instance, scenarios 2 and 3 show more than 35% and 55% decrease in WT compared to the base scenario.

However, their adverse environmental impact remains a significant challenge. The prevailing technologies for treating and handling battery waste are remarkably complex and expensive, highlighting the urgent need to upcycle spent battery materials into valuable resources to mitigate their environmental footprint. To that end, this paper reports a scheme for recycling graphite rods and Zn from Zn–C batteries. In this approach, polymeric composites synthesized using graphene flakes extracted from the graphite rods of spent batteries are used to fabricate multifunctional cotton textiles, and the outer Zn case of the spent batteries is employed as a Zn anode in energy storage devices. The synthesized multifunctional fabric shows excellent energy storage performance, particularly in Zn-ion hybrid supercapacitors, achieving a specific capacitance of 140 F g−1 at a scan rate of 0.5 A g−1; an electromagnetic interference shielding efficiency of ∼48 dB; wearable sensing capabilities for human motion detection; and Joule heating behavior for deicing. Moreover, the fabric exhibits remarkable antibacterial efficiency, with an approximately 27-mm-wide inhibition zone against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. The “waste-to-wonder” strategy presented herein holds promise for environmental protection and innovative multifunctional textile fabrication.

However, the economic feasibility of these treatments affects industrial development. We propose a system dynamics business model (SDBM) as a novel approach for forecasting the economic impact of the industry in Japan, which provides comprehensive quantitative and qualitative assessments. We designed three business models (BMs): repurposing, recycling, and circular production. Repurposing BM extends the lifespan of LIBs by encouraging battery owners and collectors to engage in the second-life LIB market. Recycling BM supports recyclers in determining cost-effective recycling technologies. Circular production BM provides a policy analysis to the government. We elucidate the anticipated benefits to stakeholders involved in BMs. If all stakeholders have community interests, a circular economy for automobile LIB recycling can be realized without government subsidies.

In this study, a method using cryolite-based electrolyte to recycle cathode materials from spent lithium nickel-cobalt-manganese oxide (LNCM) batteries is proposed. Firstly, a molten cryolite-based electrolyte is used to decompose the microstructure of spent LIB cathode material, releasing valuable lithium element into the electrolyte, which can be used in aluminum electrolysis industry. As nickel-cobalt-manganese oxides have low solubilities in the cryolite-based electrolyte, they sink to the bottom of the molten electrolyte, which is then cooled down, forming an upper and lower layer. Lithium element can be quickly and conveniently separated from nickel-cobalt-manganese oxides, which are enriched in the lower layer of the electrolyte. Then, a hydrochloric acid solution is used to leach nickel-cobalt-manganese components from the lower layer of the cryolite-based electrolyte. The effects of acid concentration, liquid-solid ratio, and temperature on the leaching process are investigated through single factor experiments. The highest leaching rates of nickel, cobalt, and manganese elements reach 99.47%, 98.94%, and 98.27%, respectively. By using NaOH + NH3·H2O to adjust the pH of the leaching solution, coprecipitation of nickel, cobalt, and manganese elements occur, producing a hydroxide precursor and resulting in recovery rates of over 99%. The recycled hydroxide precursor and new lithium source are then roasted to regenerate an LNCM811 cathode material, which has a layered microstructure and is assembled into a battery.

We conduct optimal dynamic decisions for participants associated with quality of EV batteries, further explore the rule of time evolution considering altruistic behavior.

Altruistic behavior of the manufacturer is a behavior of “profit transferring” and moderate altruistic behavior is conducive to the profitability of CLSC and cooperation motivates activity of recycling.

Understanding the public's willingness to participate is fundamental to CSES implementation and promotion. However, limited research has focused on this topic. This study investigated the public's willingness to participate in CSES, based on an extended technology acceptance model, and used social network modeling to explore the evolutionary process of public participation in CSES under different policy combination scenarios. Empirical data were obtained from online questionnaire surveys in four first-tier cities in China (N = 1276). The results show that (1) the majority (approximately 71.48%) of residents have a higher willingness to participate in CSES, but their willingness to invest in it is lower (22.32 yuan/month). Residents with lower willingness mainly believed that they should not pay extra maintenance and management fees for energy storage equipment, followed by concerns about the safety of this equipment. (2) Economic benefits, functional value, risk affordability, peer influence, and personal altruism are the determining factors that affect public participation in CSES. (3) Social interaction is beneficial for information transmission, thereby reducing the cognitive differences among the public regarding CSES. (4) The “economic incentive and mandatory” policy combination has significantly increased the proportion of public participation in CSES, but there is psychological resistance from the public toward policy implementation in the early stages. The “economic incentive and publicity” policy combination can promote public participation in CSES slightly.

Flame synthesis (FS) is a new manufacturing technology of nanostructured materials with few equipment and high efficiency, which potentially can substantially bring down the manufacturing cost of cathode materials. The primary objective of the present study was to quantitatively evaluate the resources, energy consumption and economic feasibility of large-scale production of cathode materials though FS. In the analysis process, the mass flow of reactants and resultants as well as the minimum cathode material selling price (MCSP) of ternary cathode material LiNi x Co y Mn(1-x-y)O2 (x + y + z = 1) produced by FS were calculated, and compared with that of the conventional hydroxide co-precipitation method. Results show that the production of ternary cathode material through FS can reduce CO2 emissions by ∼60% and water consumption by ∼30%. MCSP of LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM523), LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622), and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) produced by FS are 224.8 k¥/t, 235.1 k¥/t, 240.0 k¥/t, which respectively are about 2%, 10% and 14% lower than the average selling prices in Chinese market, indicating that FS is economically feasible for producing ternary cathode materials. Particularly, for the production of high-nickel cathode materials, FS has notable potential in simplifying the production process and manufacturing costs. Sensitivity analysis of NCM811 produced by FS shows that when raw material price, fuel and power costs are reduced by 25%, MCSP can be as low as 186.4 k¥/t. When the metal cation concentration of the solution increases to 3.2 mol/L, it enables FS to meet the most rigorous energy consumption limitation standards in China. When the lithium excess is reduced from 10% to 5%, MCSP of NCM811 can be further reduced by 5.6 k¥/t, indicating that lithium loss due to high temperatures in FS is a moderate factor for reducing the manufacturing cost. Finally, this work presents a life cycle assessment (LCA) of NCM materials produced by FS in China.

The growth of this industry is expected to lead to a dramatic increase in the quantity of end-of-life EV traction batteries in the future, posing significant challenges to environmental pollution and the sustainable development of the EV industry.

As various recycling routes are continuously developed to address this issue, a significant challenge is the fair comparison of processes entailing different unit operations and transformation stages. Indeed, the choice of metallurgical or direct recycling routes results in diverse materials flows and energy demands. To allow a suitable comparison between technologies, this work presents a grave-to-cradle analysis of cathode materials (i.e., lithium cobalt oxide) considering three recycling processes representative of the most popular routes (i.e., pyrometallurgical, hydrometallurgical, and direct recycling). Unlike previously published works, a system-level analysis of both material recovery and energy preservation was carried out using statistical entropy and exergy analysis, respectively. Furthermore, comparison of processes using exentropy, a recently proposed circularity parameter combining both material recovery and energy preservation, was performed for the first time. The results highlight the need of a robust multidimensional analysis of processes to properly determine their suitability according to the needs of the circular economy. When materials and energy preservation were analyzed independently, two different routes were identified as optimal. The need of a robust multidimensional analysis of processes to properly account for the goals of the circular economy is thus highlighted. Exentropy analysis suggested that direct recycling provides the optimum alternative in terms of energy utilization for the recovery of materials.";"2024-09-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624028841";"3";"Batteries"

However, the task of designing a resilient network remains complex and costly. One potential solution to bolster resilience is the deployment of battery energy storage devices on the consumer side, known as distributed energy systems (DES). Despite its effectiveness, the high construction costs and lengthy payback period associated with investing in energy storage devices have led consumers to exhibit reluctance in adopting them. Cloud energy storage (CES) is an innovative and cost-effective solution to address those challenges. In the CES platform, investors install storage facilities in the network which can be rented by consumers to fulfill their needs and they become holders of the virtual batteries. By adopting this approach, consumers are relieved from the burden of maintenance, repair, and installation. While a single CES facility offers reduced costs and increased comfort for consumers, it compromises the resilience of the grid when compared to the Distributed Energy Storage (DES) mechanism. In order to bridge this gap, this paper proposes a dual CES model which serves as an intermediate solution between DES and single CES. The dual CES model strikes a balance between the resilience of the grid and cost-effectiveness. It provides a higher level of resilience compared to a single CES and a lower level compared to DES. Additionally, the costs associated with the dual CES model fall between that of a single CES and DES. This model not only increases the profit margin for investors but also enhances the overall comfort and well-being of consumers compared to the single CES. To validate the proposed model, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problem is formulated and simulated on the IEEE 33 bus network. Three cases are considered: DES, single CES, and dual CES. The results indicate that the dual CES reduces consumers' costs by 28 %, losses by 27 %, unsupplied load costs by 45 %, and return on investment by 33 %. Moreover, it increases the stability margin time by 2 intervals and improves robustness by 47 %. ";"2024-09-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624028816";"1";"Batteries"

In addition to materials recovery, the topic of repurposing retired LIBs is currently receiving increasing attention. This study proposes and assesses three classification criteria—capacity, resistance, and a composite of both—to enable more effective classification of retired batteries according to various consistency requirements and real-world application purposes. Instead of the battery capacity, which is often time-consuming to acquire, multiple aging features quickly obtained from the incremental capacity analysis curves, the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy curves, and the current curves during the constant-voltage charging process are employed to classify the retired batteries under different criteria. The accuracy of the classification is tested by utilizing the features extracted from these curves as the input to four supervised machine learning (ML) models, namely CatBoost, random forest, support vector machine, and deep neural networks. A detailed comparison is made across different classification criteria, aging features, and the adopted ML models. We demonstrate that the accuracy of classification depends on the selection of features for each criterion.

The proposed scenarios include different electricity market types (i.e., peer-to-grid, peer-to-peer, and energy storage sharing) considering utilization mechanism (i.e., individual-design or shared-design) and ownership (i.e., user-owned or developer-owned) of the BESS. Towards this end, this study develops comprehensive and systematic mathematical models for BESS sizing using mixed-integer linear programming algorithm, and the BESS sizing is optimized to maximize the total net present value. The developed models are validated in the Hong Kong context considering four peers, and the empirical data of electric load profile as well as the photovoltaic installed capacity are collected. As a result, it is indicated that the optimal BESS capacity in energy storage sharing scenario is the least. In terms of electricity bill saving, user-owned BESS is regarded as the model yielding the highest electricity bill savings. The breakdown of net present value exposes that under the same ownership, the optimal BESS capacity is determined by different utilization mechanisms. Regarding the total net present value, it is found that developer-owned BESS could achieve the maximum economic merits. Nonetheless, the distribution loss through energy storage sharing is also the highest. The policy implications of this study primarily emphasize incentivizing user-owned BESS, promoting energy storage sharing, supporting shared BESS infrastructure, and encouraging a diversity of electricity trading mechanisms to enhance the integration and efficiency of renewable energy systems.

The study reveals that the electro-thermal conversion efficiency of electromagnetically heated iron ore particles increases with particle mass flow rate at different wall temperatures, reaching a maximum of 93.8% at 500 °C. In contrast, the efficiency trend for quartz sand particles is inconsistent, peaking at 68% due to poor thermal conductivity causing inefficiencies at higher mass flow rates. A dimensionless mathematical model (Re-Nu, Re < 10) for both particles is derived from experimental data, offering theoretical guidance for industrialization. Experiments with a shell-and-tube solid particle-packed bed yield continuous production of 35 kg/h, 300 °C superheated steam for 12 min with an 86.4% discharge efficiency and achieve an 81% cycle efficiency, which surpasses compressed air storage(60%), approaches battery and flywheel efficiency(85%).

The results showed that the ISC during overheating was caused by contact between the aluminum current collector and the anode on the surface of the battery cell. Four typical ISC experiments were designed to analyze the ISC process of the battery. There were two processes competing for anode's lithium after the ISC. One was the self-discharge reaction of the battery, and the other was the side reaction. Both processes can be affected by temperature. The ISC was interrupted when the side reaction was dominant, causing the anode to retain a part of the lithium for the next side reaction, which ultimately led to the battery TR. The TR risk was reduced when the self-discharge reaction was dominant, and experimental evidence was given. Finally, equivalent circuit diagram of ISC was proposed, and the evolution mechanism of ISC and TR of the battery was analyzed in detail based on it.

To address this issue, we propose an iterative two-layer optimization to investigate customized price of electricity for different types of users in the presence of photovoltaic uncertainty. By taking into account power flow restrictions, the model is used to explore the optimal time-of-use, demand, and on-grid prices for both electricity consumers and prosumers.

Recycling LIBs is an effective measure generating feedstocks for refabrication in order to address resource strain, mitigate environmental impacts, aligning with the goals of cleaner production and sustainability. This study aims to provide a comprehensive energy-economy-environment assessment framework for feedstock production (Li2CO3, NiSO4·6H2O, CoSO4·7H2O) via hydrometallurgical recycling and natural exploitation. We compare recycling 1t of spent ternary LIBs to traditional natural exploitation methods by considering energy consumption, economic costs, and environmental impacts. Recycling routes incur 2.9–9.3 × 104 MJ energy consumptions, 3.8–4.4 × 104 CNY economic costs and 1.5–4.2 × 103 kg CO2 eq. emissions, while natural exploitation routes result in 4.6–8.6 × 104 MJ, 1.1–2.0 × 104 CNY and 2.7–3.9 × 103 kg CO2 eq, respectively. This study reveals that, in most environmental impact categories, natural exploitation routes fall between pyrolysis and non-pyrolysis recycling routes. Furthermore, significant difference in environmental and energy impacts per unit feedstock production are observed when utilizing mass-based and value-based allocation methods. When adopting mass-based, carbon emissions of Recycling route1 (based on full-component pyrolysis) is 41% of that using Li2CO3 from brine route for 1 kg of Li2CO3 production.

In specific operational scenarios and instances of failures, large-scale integrated LHS systems may operate with either single or partial sets of heat exchange tubes. However, a notable research gap exists in the comprehensive exploration of the impact of partial operational conditions on the thermal performance of LHS systems. Consequently, this study conducted experiments involving both- and single-sided charging and discharging using a cylindrical high-temperature LHS system equipped with two sets of heat exchange tubes. To comprehend the ramifications of single-sided operation on temperature distribution across both active and inactive sides, as well as its influence on charging/discharging power and accumulated stored/released energy on the active side. The analysis of phase change material (PCM) temperature distribution revealed that single-sided charging significantly influenced the inactive side, while single-sided discharging exhibited a comparatively minor impact on the inactive side. As PCM melted during charging, temperature disparities diminished due to natural convection, while non-uniform temperature persisted in unmelted PCM. Examination of the PCM liquidus indicated that the metal heat exchange tube enhanced heat transfer on the inactive side, resulting in substantial PCM melting during charging. However, the heat transfer effect of metal heat exchange tubes during discharging was insignificant, leading to a considerable amount of liquid PCM on the inactive side after discharging. The total heat storage for both-sided charging was 1002.71 MJ, whereas, for single-sided charging using two tubes, it was 1074.42 MJ and 1000.60 MJ, respectively. Correspondingly, during discharging, the average powers were 682.74 MJ, 543.62 MJ, and 538.11 MJ, respectively. The cycle efficiency for the both-sided operation was 68.09 %, while those for single-sided operations of two tubes were 50.6 % and 53.78 %, respectively.

NCM (LiNixCoyMnzO2) batteries, prized for their high energy density, are pivotal in this industry. However, their production relies on critical metals, posing environmental challenges. Recycling processes aim to address this issue by recovering critical metals from end-of-life batteries. The industry is updating from NCM 111 to NCM 811 batteries to enhance energy density and reduce costs, but the key factors influencing the material flows and environmental impacts remain uncertain. This paper aims to identify the key factors contributing to the potential differences in material flows and environmental impacts introduced by the NCM battery upgrading in China. Following the new energy vehicle sales projections in China until 2035, a dynamic material flow analysis was employed to calculate material demands, recovered amounts, and substitution rates for various upgrading scenarios. The study reveals that the majority of retired batteries until 2035 were sold between 2022 and 2029. Material substitution rates prove to be more sensitive to the upgrading scenario than the lifetime and growth rate of BEVs. Faster NCM 811 penetration results in over 2.5 times more saved cobalt demand compared to additional nickel demand. A life cycle assessment of NCM batteries reveals a 39% lower global warming impact for NCM 811 compared to NCM 111, highlighting environmental benefits from increased energy density and reduced cobalt consumption. The energy density improvement contributed 85%, while the alteration in material composition contributed 15% to the global warming reduction in NCM 811. Recycling emerges as a crucial strategy in mitigating environmental impacts across all categories, particularly addressing eutrophication, previously deemed challenging due to the difficulty in recovering Li2CO3.";"2024-07-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624022066";"5";"Batteries"

Battery recycling in China is currently dominated by electric vehicle manufacturer, supplemented by other market players such as battery producers and electric vehicle retailers. Due to the lack of information, battery recycling lacks cooperation and communication, and the whole market is dealing with ""Information Island."" Therefore, based on information sharing and channel competition, this paper designs a Stackelberg game model with an electric vehicle manufacturer, an electric vehicle retailer, and a third-party recycler as the primary participants. This study found that effective information sharing can reduce intensified market competition and promote the transformation of market players into “collaboration state”. To promote partnership in the battery recycling market, this paper proposes a revenue-sharing contract incentive for the electric vehicle retailer to share demand information about battery recycling. It finds a revenue-sharing contract based on information sharing can help companies and competitors make appropriate behavioral choices in the battery recycling market. This study demonstrates that information sharing benefits the electric vehicle manufacturer and the third-party recycler while offering no advantages to the electric vehicle retailer. The decreasing accuracy of demand signals results in the diminishing value of information sharing for the electric vehicle manufacturer and the third-party recycler. The revenue-sharing contract can incentivize the electric vehicle retailer to share information. ";"2024-07-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624021498";"5";"Batteries"

Therefore, recycling Co from the spent Co-enriched materials is indispensable. Co-based perovskites, which contain abundant Co, are extensively utilized in solid oxide fuel cells, three-way catalysts, and oxygen-permeable membranes, and the recovery of Co from the spent Co-based perovskites is necessary to meet the long-term requirement of Co. In this work, a facile and universal thermal reduction method (750 °C and N2 atmosphere) is employed to convert the spent cobalt-based perovskites into high-performance bifunctional oxygen catalysts for zinc-air batteries (ZABs), achieving high-efficient Co recovery and re-utilization. At high temperatures, melamine and dopamine hydrochloride are transformed into carbon nanotubes, C3N4 and reducing gases (such as NH3 and H2). Simultaneously, the metal elements in the spent Co-based perovskites (SrNb0.1Co0.7Fe0.2O3,SNCF) are converted into nano-scale alloy particles and metal nitrides. Then, the phase structures, micromorphology, and element valences of the obtained multiphase oxygen catalyst (SNCF–Ni-PM) are characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning/transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. The electrochemical properties, including oxygen catalytic activities and stability, of SNCF-Ni-PM are measured by linear sweep voltammetry, chronopotentiometry, chronoamperometry, and cyclic voltammetry methods. Considering the practical applications, the aqueous and solid-state ZABs are assembled and measured. The results demonstrate that the multiphase SNCF-Ni-PM mainly includes carbon nanotubes, C3N4 nanosheets, and FeNiN or CoFe nanoparticles. Moreover, SNCF-Ni-PM exhibits excellent bifunctional oxygen catalytic activity, with an oxygen evolution reaction (OER) potential at 10 mA cm−2 of 1.51 V and an oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) half-wave potential of 0.77 V, outperforming most of the reported oxygen catalysts. Using SNCF-Ni-PM, the aqueous and solid-state ZABs can achieve high power densities of 295.9 and 228.4 mW cm−2, respectively, being superior to most ZABs. In addition, the aqueous ZAB with SNCF-Ni-PM can operate stably for 300 h with a slight degradation. This work provides a feasible method for effectively recycling Co from the spent Co-based perovskites.

However, existing literature provides limited evidence on the contribution of non-subsidized industrial policies, particularly to the PLiB industry. To bridge this gap, using data of 31 PLiB listed firms and 279 relevant non-subsidized industrial policies, this paper analyzes the effects of non-subsidized industrial policies on the global value chain (GVC) embedding position. The results reveal that non-subsidized industrial policies significantly raise the GVC embedding position of Chinese PLiB firms, and the positive effects are prone to increase over the research period. Further investigation shows that there is heterogeneity among PLiB firms, with the raising effects on the GVC embedding position being more significant in eastern and middle PLiB firms, private PLiB firms and midstream PLiB firms. The mechanism verification shows that non-subsidized industrial policies raise GVC embedding position of PLiB firms through technological innovation effect and scale economy effect, while competitiveness effect does not give full play. These findings provide important recommendations for better design of the industrial policies to improve the international competitiveness of PLiB industry and other strategic emerging industries.

Firstly, the system is optimized to maximum hydrogen production by adjusting equipment capacity and capacity factors, informed by a 1-h resolution solar energy generation profile. This optimization yields insights into the system's yearly operational dynamics. Techno-economic analysis was conducted to estimate the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) from 2020 to 2050, additionally, uncertainty analysis using Monte-Carlo simulation to estimate the range of uncertainty in LCOH projection from 2020 to 2050 was performed. Furthermore, a quantitative risk analysis, utilizing the process route index metric, evaluates the risk of battery explosions. Finally, this study employs multi-criteria decision-making to choose the best energy storage technology to produce green hydrogen from economic and safety factors. The result indicates that in 2020, the PbC battery emerged as the most cost-effective option. However, over time, both lithium batteries became the cheapest option with almost similar trends. In terms of explosion hazard, the analysis shows that the PbC battery is a safer option for stationary energy storage. When both aspects are considered, the preferred battery option is almost certainly PbC over the years, but in extreme cases where the decision-maker places significant emphasis on economic factors both Li-ion options may become preferable.

Only monitoring the temperature and voltage limit the performance of diagnostic algorithms. The expansion behavior of batteries, which is linked to their operating status, offers a vital indicator of safety. In this study, the evolution of multidimensional signals during overcharging experiments at different current rates is comprehensively investigated. The result shows that the abnormal expansion force can be detected at temperatures as low as 35.4 °C, which achieves an early warning signal 11 min earlier than the onset of battery thermal runaway. The effect of charging rate on battery safety is comprehensively analyzed, showing that the time interval between the warning signal of the expansion force and temperature increases steadily from 151 s to 682 s as the charging rate decreases. However, the charging rate hardly affects the stage of charge boundary of venting, which is around ±118 %.

People in China as a whole intend to supplement the government's initiative. Thus, this study aims to determine adoption intention for BEVs through environmental concerns, technophilia, social norms, price and battery cost, self-esteem, range confidence, satisfaction toward adopting BEV, financial incentives, non-financial policies, and status symbol by using the theory of planned behavior (TPB). PLS-SEM was followed, and data was collected through questionnaires using purposive sampling. A total of 508 questionnaires were used in the final analysis. Multiple regression was used for hypotheses testing. Environmental concerns, technophilia, social norms, self-esteem, and range confidence significantly enhance satisfaction toward adopting BEVs. Meanwhile, price and battery cost significantly decrease customer satisfaction towards adopting BEVs. Satisfaction towards adopting BEVs, government support (i.e., financial incentives, non-financial policies), and status symbols are leading to the intention to adopt BEVs. Government support is significantly moderate, but the status symbol does not moderate between satisfaction towards adopting BEVs and adoption intention for BEVs. This research suggests that policymakers and manufacturers focus on studying factors determining the intention to adopt BEVs. This initial research integrates environmental concerns, technophilia, social norms, price and battery cost, self-esteem, range confidence, satisfaction towards adopting BEVs, financial incentives, non-financial policies, status symbol, and adoption intention for BEVs in a single framework in light of TPB.

Therefore, to identify changes in the local nickel industry and compare and analyze nickel resource circulation and recycling rates, we conducted a material flow analysis of nickel in Korea for 2018 and 2021. An integrated material flow analysis methodology was used to construct the material flow using bottom-up and top-down methods. The results showed that the domestic demand for products connected to lithium-ion batteries increased compared to the demand in 2018, as did the demand for renewable energy and renewable energy-related items, such as electric vehicles, e-bikes, and lithium-ion batteries. However, the flow of stainless steel-related products has declined since 2018 because of the declining supply and demand for automotive semiconductors owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the paradigm shift from internal combustion to electric vehicles.

This study proposes a modified mechanical exfoliation method (MEM), which employs leaching-drying pretreatment to transform waste graphite into two-dimensional graphene. Three drying methods were evaluated, among which freeze drying was found to be the most conducive for exfoliation. Pneumatic drying, being basic and simple, did not exhibit any special effects that benefit exfoliation. XRD results showed that leaching restores the lamellar structure of graphite, with peak intensity ( × 105) increasing from 6.5 to 8.9–10.1. XPS analysis revealed that vacuum roasting drying leads to dehydration condensation of hydroxyl groups between layers, resulting in the obtained graphite having the best dehydration effect and the lowest oxygen content, at only 1.89%, but this enhances interlayer forces, which is counterproductive for exfoliation. In contrast, freeze drying, through the volumetric expansion caused by the freezing of water, disrupts the interlayer forces, achieving an interlayer spacing of 337.5 nm, which facilitates the exfoliation of graphene. This was confirmed by TEM results.

To provide a reference for the research and development as well as the design of battery technologies from a criticality assessment perspective, this study employs indicators such as Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, World Governance Indicators, the innovation factors, and others to construct a criticality assessment framework for evaluating the critical situations of nine minerals and eighteen battery technologies in China. The key findings include: LiFePO4 exhibited the lowest criticality score among lithium-ion batteries. Considering energy density, some sodium-ion batteries posed higher criticality scores compared to lithium batteries. To reduce criticality scores from the perspective of battery materials, at least two other high-score materials required attention, apart from lithium-sulfur batteries.

However, cyclic degradation is an issue in high-Ni Li-ion batteries, especially in battery packs. The packing pattern plays a key role in the energy degradation and thermal behaviour of the final battery products. In this study, the effects of preloading, current rate, and environment temperature on the capacity fading of Li-ion batteries are experimentally investigated, and the corresponding mechanisms are discussed. The experimental uncertainty of capacity fading, resistance, and swelling force are 9.4%, 8.9%, and 2.8%, respectively. The results show that, when the cell is tested at 45 °C, the capacity loss is approximately ∼4.2 times that at 25 °C after 720 cycles. The current rate also plays a key role in the life of the cell; the estimated life is 860 and 1942 cycles for 1 C and 1/3 C, respectively. The most important finding is that an increase in the preloading can lengthen the life of lithium-ion cells. When the preloading is varied from 0 N to 1000 N at intervals of 250 N, the cell life span is estimated to be 1942, 1678, 2063, 2083, and 2421 cycles, respectively. In addition, our battery has certain advantages in terms of capacity degradation such that the required raw materials and hazardous waste of the battery can be reduced. Finally, the module is tested to estimate its capacity and constrained force evolution. Thus, the results of this study can guide the development and design of cell packing patterns and further investigations in this field.

Elevated or scalloped coating edges are often formed because of inadequate coater design. Traditional coater design approaches entail resource-intensive coating experiments or time-consuming simulations. In this study, we present a five-step optimization framework to achieve uniform coating thickness in the cross-web direction. First, we conducted computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations by using a preselected set of 13 variables related to coater design and rheological properties of the slurry. Non-uniform coating characteristics were captured as dimensionless features derived from the CFD data. Then, we constructed a surrogate model to accurately replicate the CFD simulation and evaluate the dimensionless features. The surrogate model exhibited a high level of consistency with the original CFD data. The importance of the design variables was assessed in terms of accumulated local effects and Shapley values. On the basis of this assessment, six design variables related to coater geometry were selected to determine the optimal coater design given the coater width and slurry properties. Finally, genetic algorithms were employed to minimize the dimensionless features associated with defective coating edges. Statistically, the solutions reduced the number of dimensionless edge features by more than 90%. A comparison between the velocity profile data obtained by CFD and the surrogate model for the optimized solutions demonstrated the successful elimination of super-elevated edges in the coating. The proposed framework offers an effective optimization strategy that can be applied to practical coater design to minimize the occurrence of edge defects in the battery manufacturing industry.

The inventory data is collected from highly cited literature published in recent years, and the footprint family impact values generated by different types of battery packs are compared and analyzed.

With the development of energy storage technology, this problem can be effectively solved by configuring energy storage, but how to reasonably configure energy storage is one of the key issues due to the expensive energy storage. To this end, a multi-timescale nested energy storage capacity optimization model for multi-energy supplemental renewable energy system with pumped storage hydro plant based on a three-battery group control operation strategy is proposed. First, the electrochemical energy storage is added to the supplemental renewable energy system containing hydro-wind-solar to form a hybrid energy storage system with pumped storage hydro units, and its group control strategy and charging/discharging coordinated operation are investigated. Then, a double-layer energy storage capacity optimization model nested in multiple time scales is developed. The inner layer optimizes hydropower and pumped storage output to smooth out the more fluctuating wind power output with large time scales. The outer layer optimizes energy storage taking into account factors such as output deviation, cost, attenuation, and dynamic prediction life to smooth out the less volatile and smaller time-scale wind power. Finally, simulation demonstrates that the proposed model can make full use of the flexible regulation capability of pumped storage hydro units and the fast response capability of batteries to maximize the fluctuation of the supplemental system into the grid, and further reduce the peaking pressure of the receiving end of the grid.

Presently, lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are extensively utilized in consumer electronics. If power LIB-equipped electric vehicles (EVs) deeply penetrate the automotive market, the recovery of cobalt from end-of-life batteries will largely impact the future availability of this resource. However, the contribution of battery recycling to cobalt availability is unclear, as the possibility of recovering cobalt for reuse in manufacturing is uncertain. We adopted prospective dynamic macro material flow analysis methods in this study based on stock-driven models to explore cobalt demand trends for the widespread deployment of EVs and the potential impact of battery recycling on cobalt supply and demand, thereby examining the cobalt cycle in China's anthroposphere during the period of 2010–2060. The results demonstrate that if the quality of recovered cobalt is not high enough to be reused in battery manufacturing, the recovered cobalt may result in a serious potential oversupply of secondary materials. The first year of such an oversupply would occur sometime between 2034 and 2057, and the cumulative oversupply of recovered cobalt during the period of 2031 and 2060 is projected to be fall within 0.012–3.30 million tons, depending on battery type, recovery rate (RR) and electrification scenario. Moreover, the supply-demand gap has the potential to reach 0.19 to 0.55 million tons by 2060. An explosive growth in total cobalt demand would inevitably drive a faster increase in virgin cobalt material imports or the exploitation of large quantities of cobalt, thus resulting in potential supply disruptions and restricting the sustainable utilization of this resource. Conversely, if the quality of recovered cobalt remains intact, it would meet 25.4%–66.9% of the cumulative cobalt inflows for EV battery manufacturing between 2010 and 2060, depending on the RRs and electrification scenarios. Consequently, the rapid development of cost-efficient closed-loop battery recycling methods through timely improvements in recycling infrastructure, industrial policies, recycling systems, and clean production of entire battery recycling chains is imperative. Uncertainty analysis indicates that changes in battery lifespan and battery capacity only slightly influence cobalt material flows, whereas variations in vehicle ownership and population development have more obvious effects. These findings can serve as a scientific reference for the formulation of targeted industrial policies for EVs and batteries and the development of cost-effective and efficient recycling systems and technologies, thus facilitating the sustainable management of EVs and batteries in China, as well as driving high-quality cobalt recycling.

However, the separation of valuable metals from the lixivium of spent LIBs, which contains Al, Cu, Ni, Co, Mn, and Li, is complicated, burdensome, and unsustainable. Therefore, there is a need to establish a more sustainable and energy-efficient method for recycling spent LIBs. The study introduced an innovative methodology for replacing the impurity ion removal process in the lixivium with magnetic separation pretreatment. Then, the co-precipitation method was used to directly resynthesize LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (LNCM523) with recovered metals as raw materials. The results demonstrate that, with a magnetic field intensity of 3000 Oe and feed particle size of −0.074 mm, the magnetic separation concentrates the following grades: Ni-26.34%, Co-14.26%, Mn-28.30%, Al-0.23%, and Cu-0.41%. The corresponding recovery rates were also determined as follows: Ni-92.57%, Co-94.16%, Mn-85.68%, Al-1.62%, and Cu-2.14%. The total impurities (Al, Cu, and Fe) in the lixivium obtained by magnetic separation concentrate under conventional acid leaching conditions were below 0.05 wt%, while the contents of Ni, Co, and Mn were measured at 13.08 g/L, 7.10 g/L, and 14.06 g/L, respectively. Spherical LNCM523 was successfully regenerated from the lixivium through co-precipitation and sintering. The LNCM523 demonstrated exceptional electrochemical performance, exhibiting a notable initial discharge capacity of 173.9 mAh/g at 0.2 C and remarkable cycling stability with 91.9% retention over 100 cycles at 0.5 C. In comparison to the conventional approach, this method circumvented the intricate procedure of separating metal ions, thereby realizing the resource regeneration of cathode materials and enabling a closed-circuit recycling process. These advancements contributed to fostering sustainable low-carbon development of the spent LIBs.

We explore the conditions for the survival of a unique technology in the long term. Learning by doing suggests focusing on a single technology while differentiation and decreasing return to scale (cost convexity) favor diversification. Exogenous technical change also plays a role. The interaction between these factors is analyzed in a general model. It is proved that in absence of convexity and exogenous technical change, only one technology is used for the whole transition. We then apply this framework to analyze the competition between fuel-cell electric buses (FCEBs) and battery electric buses (BEB) in the European bus sector, considering both learning by doing and exogenous technical change. The model is calibrated and solved. It is shown that the existence of a niche for FCEBs critically depends on the speed at which cost reductions are achieved. The speed depends both on the size of the niche and the rate of learning by doing for FCEBs.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140366";"Advanced Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy for Fuel Cell Hybrid Electric Vehicles ";" This paper aims to develop an Advanced Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (AECMS) for efficient fuel cell hybrid electric vehicles (FCHEV). The Equivalent Consumption Minimization Strategy (ECMS) is one of the most feasible solutions for hybrid electric vehicles as it has less complexity and low computational cost in making the optimal control decision. However, typical ECMS designs with fixed gain use could not enhance an optimal energy control when dealing with multi decisive factors for highly non-linear and uncertain systems like FCHEVs. To address this control challenge, the AECMS is developed as the combination of the ECMS and an adaptive equivalence factor to optimally split the energy flow between the fuel cell and battery in the FCHEV. First, a cost function is formulated based on two key objectives which are power consumptions of the fuel cell and battery, the equivalence factor and a set of soft and hard constraints, considering the number of fuel cell start/stop, fuel cell optimal operating range, state of charge (SoC) range, temperature ranges and power limits. Second, the adaptive equivalence factor is newly designed as the combination of states and dynamics of the fuel cell and battery and corresponding weighting factors. Third, fuzzy inferences are derived to adjust online the weighting factors in an adaptive manner according to the working conditions of the energy sources, subsequently improving the overall vehicle energy efficiency and maintaining the battery SoC while prolonging their lifetime. Numerical simulations using a FCHEV model have been carried out under UDDS and HWFET drive cycles to illustrate the superior performance of the AECMS against the traditional ECMS.

The proposed method attempts to make the following three contributions: 1) By fusion of particle filter (PF)-based general deterioration trend description and similar fragment extraction-based local capacity regeneration capture, the developed method can achieve accurate aging trajectory and EOL prediction. 2) Considering the similarity in degradation paths, a novel dynamic time warping-based similar fragment extraction method is proposed to learn the deterioration path from the same type batteries' limited capacity degradation curves. 3) On the basis of the predicted future capacity, the PF-based capacity empiric degradation model can be iteratively updated to accurately reflect battery future general deterioration trend. The validation results based on Beijing Institute of Technology dataset demonstrate that the maximum mean absolute error and root mean squared error of predicted aging trajectory, and the maximum value of absolute relative error between reference and predicted EOL achieved by the developed method with the help of the same type of battery's limited capacity degradation curves are only 1.09%, 1.28% and 3.23%, respectively.

The variations of the recycling performance have been documented in many studies. The main mechanism of delamination is the inactivation of bonding forces provided by the polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binder. It is believed that the storage environment (air exposure time) will affect the performances of delamination to some extent. Three representative methods (direct calcination, pressure washing, and NMP solvent extraction) for delamination were studied to elucidate the effect of air exposure time on delamination efficiency. The peel-off efficiency (98–99%) of the direct calcination method was barely influenced by air exposure time. The pressure washing system or NMP solvent extraction method also exhibited high peel-off efficiency using samples after a long air exposure time (1 month), however these methods may have problems regarding Al contamination, i.e., 11.5 mg/g of pressure washing system and 134.4 mg/g of NMP solvent extraction. Results suggest that enhanced adhesion (0.11 MPa/month) could be a potential reason why air contact time affects delamination, with O2 and/or H2O acting as contributors. This finding may help to maximum performance of delamination, as it highlights the importance of storage conditions of the spent LIBs prior to direct recycling.

In order to make better use of the batteries, a preferable equalization method is required. However, the existing studies mainly focus on the equalization circuits and the simplification of control models. This paper further proposes a double-layer state of health (SOH) equalization method namely AMDL-equalization, in which a novel cooperatively coevolving algorithm (AMCCPSO-CG) is developed and the model predictive control (MPC) is also introduced. In the developed AMDL-equalization method, the first equalization layer is used to solve the optimal dispatching problem among battery packs, and the degradation rates of the battery packs are also efficiently adjusted in the first layer. In addition, considering the number of packs in a large-scale battery system, the category-based variable grouping mechanism is proposed and a novel co-evolutionary algorithm namely AMCCPSO-CG is developed to improve the optimal power dispatching performance. For the second equalization layer, the MPC-AMCCPSO-CG algorithm is developed to efficiently optimize the depth of discharge (DOD) and adjust the degradation rate for each battery. Experimental results show that the developed AMDL-equalization method can obtain promising performance on reducing the differences among batteries.

The current method of directly adding precipitants into strongly acidic electrode filtrate to obtain lithium results in contamination and renders it non-reusable. Therefore, an adsorption method was proposed for the capture and adsorption of lithium-ion from a strongly acidic solution. Subsequently, the porous, magnetic, and spherical carbon adsorbents were used for magnetic separation after reaching saturation during the adsorption process. In this work, the porous carbon beads were prepared using coal tar pitch as a precursor material, and the different magnetization methods of as-prepared carbon beads were investigated, including in-situ and impregnated magnetization. The results demonstrate a significant increase in mesopore volume from 0.0610 cm3/g to 0.2120 cm3/g by in-situ magnetization, thereby enhancing the availability of transport channels for lithium-ion adsorption. The graphitization degree of porous carbon beads is improved by magnetization, which is attributed to the catalytic graphitization effect of Fe. The ID/IG value of porous carbon beads decreases the most from 2.68 to 2.48 by impregnated magnetization, while the content of iron retained after activation is low, and the remanent magnetism of PCB-FeCl3 is far less than that of PCB-Fe3O4 (25.1103 emu/g).

This necessity arises despite the low commercial value of LES, as conventional recovery methods are cost-prohibitive, leading to insufficient attention to LES recovery. The recent surge in retired batteries has resulted in a significant accumulation of LES, posing serious environmental concerns, however, the high content of Fe and P resources in LES presents a potential value. The study begins with a theoretical analysis, concluding that the reduction leaching of LES is a feasible approach. By integrating this with the Fe powder synthesis route for FePO4, it is found that efficient leaching of LES can be achieved using a low concentration of H2SO4, thereby significantly reducing the recovery cost. This method not only efficiently utilize LES but also alleviates environmental pressure. The thermodynamic analysis sheds light on the mechanism of LES leaching and FePO4 synthesis, confirming the feasibility of each reaction. Optimal leaching conditions (1.4 times the stoichiometric amount of H2SO4, 1.5 times the amount of Fe powder, an L/S ratio of 5 mL/g, and a reaction duration of 150 min at 60 °C), under which the leaching rates of Fe and P reached 94.66% and 98.23%, respectively.

Furthermore, adopting low-cobalt battery technology, which extends battery life and reduces battery replacement in EVs, can significantly reduce secondary cobalt demand. At the provincial level, cobalt demand and recycling in China are unevenly distributed, with provinces with high demand for cobalt showing a trend of shifting from inland areas in the northwest to central and eastern coastal areas. In contrast, the areas with the largest recycling volume remain in the north. Therefore, accelerating the promotion of low cobalt and long-life battery technology and improving recycling efficiency can greatly alleviate the cobalt supply risk in China's electrification process. Additionally, specific spatial layouts should be given attention to ensure the sound development of China's EV industry through national coordination so that the double carbon target can be accomplished on time or even ahead of schedule.

However, the mechanism by which trace metal impurities in WSi affect battery performance remains unclear. The present work quantitatively analyzed the key role of metal impurities physically doped into WSi in determining the performance of Si-based anodes. A paradoxical phenomenon in which metal impurities in WSi powders decreased the conductivity of the material was identified. Doping with magnetic metal impurities was also found to increase the magnetic strength of WSi powders while significantly enhancing the self-discharge effect of Si-based anodes. The mechanism responsible for this effect was revealed based on in situ monitoring and quantitative characterization. Trace metal impurities in WSi-based anodes were shown to spontaneously undergo electrochemical corrosion reactions, resulting in the formation of metal dendrites in the battery and the decomposition of the electrolyte. As a result, the battery performance became unstable and prone to safety hazard. The results of this research provide theoretical support for the value-added recycling of WSi based on manufacturing highly stable, safe Si-based anodes for lithium-ion batteries.

When choosing a proper battery thermal management system (BTMS), a comprehensive investigation should be made in terms of design complexity, system cost, and cooling efficiency, which usually forms a trade-off. In this study, four types of BTMS including air cooling, single phase immersion, indirect cooling, and two phase immersion are first evaluated on pouch battery pack. To describe the uniform heat generation, batteries are simulated by a three-dimensional electrochemical-thermal coupled model. Results show that air cooling and immersion cooling exhibits less extra weight, while two phase immersion delivers better in suppressing temperature rise and maintaining temperature uniformity. Then, the simulations involving different coolants are conducted for two phase immersion-based BTMS. The thermal behaviors of battery pack are examined at 5, 7, and 9 C discharge rates. The R1336mzz(Z) coolant with high boiling heat transfer coefficient is suitable for thermal management at high discharge rates.

By establishing a transient thermal-electric-fluid multi-physics field numerical model, the thermal performance of the BTMS is thoroughly examined in two cases. The findings demonstrate that increasing the TEC input current, fin length, and thickness is beneficial for reducing the maximum temperature and PCM liquid fraction. Nevertheless, although the increase in fin length can lower the temperature difference, the influence of fin thickness and TEC input current on the temperature difference is tiny. Based on the numerical findings, the optimal fin length and thickness of 7 mm and 3 mm are obtained. In this situation, when the TEC input current is 3 A, the maximum temperature, temperature difference, and PCM liquid fraction in Case 1 are 315.10 K, 2.39 K, and 0.002, respectively, and those are respectively 318.24 K, 3.60 K, and 0.181 in Case 2. The configuration of Case 1 outperforms that of Case 2, due to the fewer TECs and greater distance from the battery pack to the TEC within Case 2. When experiencing a higher battery discharge rate, the TEC input current should also be correspondingly increased to ensure the temperature performance of the battery.

For this novel technology to be commercially applicable, significant scientific research is required. Although few attempts have been made in this area, the limitations of existing studies encourage further investigation to advance the field. This research aims to develop a solar-based hybrid cold storage (SHCS) system and perform the techno-economic analysis (TEA) of the system to address the existing research challenges and enhance the understanding of commercial applications. An SHCS of L 4.88 m × W 2.44 m × H 2.44 m has been developed by integrating 500 kg phase change materials (PCM) of ethylene glycol aquas solution, as latent thermal energy storage (LTES), to store energy and provide backup during off-solar time. Three different modes of the power system, Latent Thermal Energy Storage (LTES)-based, Electrochemical Energy Storage (EES)-based (Battery), and no storage; and three types of construction materials, sandwich polyurethane (PUR) panels, sandwich expanded polystyrene (EPS) panels, and concrete were considered in the TEA of the SHCS. The power mode with LTES showed a nearly 1.5 years shorter payback period and 130 % higher net present value (NPV) than the EES mode. The solidification and melting characteristics of the LTES system are uniform at different levels during charging and discharging, which may enhance the heat transfer rate. The PCM system is remarkable in that it maintains a storage temperature of 3 °C in the fresh food chamber for approximately 13 h without an external source of energy. Regarding the construction material of SHCS, sandwich PUR panels outperformed concrete owing to their lower density (40 kg/m3), improved thermal insulation, and modular nature, though the rate of return of PUR panels is slightly lower (0.26 % and 0.81 %) than its counterparts due to its higher initial cost. Overall, it was found that PUR panel-made SHCS integrated with an LTES system provides better techno-economic performance when energy storage is necessary and could be considered to scale up the system in the future for commercial application.";"2024-01-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623045523";"6";"Batteries"

Driven by this, an experimental investigation was carried out to study the characteristics of TR and gas venting behaviors in commercial lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries that were induced by overcharging under different rates. As the charging rate increases, the growth rate of lithium dendrites accelerates, resulting in the earlier formation of large-scale short circuits and a rapid transition to the next stage of the TR chain reaction. However, the temperature rise and the total heat does not increase in proportion to the charge rates. The electrolyte also accelerates its decomposition, and the reaction between the electrolyte and lithium is the main reason of overcharge heat accumulation.

Currently, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are considered as suitable replacements for diesel fleets. However, these technologies continue to face techno-economic barriers, creating uncertainty for fleet operators wanting to transition away from diesel-powered internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). This paper assesses the performance and cost competitiveness of BEV and FCEV powertrain solutions in the hard-to-abate HGV sector. The study evaluates the impact of battery degradation and a carbon tax on the cost of owning the vehicles. An integrated total cost of ownership (TCO) model, which includes these factors for the first time, is developed to study a large retailer's HGV fleet operating in the UK. The modelling framework compares the capital expenditures (CAPEX) and operating expenses (OPEX) of alternative technologies against ICEVs. The TCO of BEVs and FCEVs are 11% to 33% and 37% to 78% higher than ICEVs; respectively. Despite these differences, by adopting a longer lifetime for the vehicle it can effectively narrow the cost gap. Alternatively, cost parity with ICEVs could be achieved if BEV battery cost reduces by 56% or if FCEV fuel cell cost reduces by 60%. Besides, the pivot point for hydrogen price is determined at £2.5 per kg. The findings suggest that BEV is closer to market as its TCO value is becoming competitive, whereas FCEV provides a more viable solution than BEV for long-haul applications due to shorter refuelling time and lower load capacity penalties. Furthermore, degradation of performance in lithium-ion batteries is found to have a minor impact on TCO if battery replacement is not required. However, critical component replacement and warranty can influence commercial viability.

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have shown immense potential for metal extraction from end-of-life (EoL) LIBs. However, a complicated subsequent separation process is required due to the non-selectivity of the DES components for metal. Herein, we propose a tandem precipitant-free hydrometallurgical process for the selective recovery of Li and other valuable metals (Ni, Co, Mn) from EoL LIBs using a green DES. The process parameters, viz., reaction temperature (T), time (t), pulp density (S/L), and molar ratio (MR) of ethylene glycol to tartaric acid, were optimized via the statistical optimization technique of response surface methodology. The results revealed maximum extraction efficiencies of 99.2 ± 0.5%, 96.1 ± 1.4%, 95.2 ± 1.2%, and 97.8 ± 1.5% for Li, Ni, Co, and Mn, respectively, under the optimized process conditions of T = 118 °C, t = 17 min, S/L = 42 g/L, and MR = 3:1. The kinetic study showed that interfacial reaction governed the extraction process. A plausible mechanism depicting the role of DES constituents in synergistically facilitating the extraction reaction was elucidated. Moreover, Li and other metals (Ni, Co, and Mn) were selectively separated and recovered with an overall efficiency of ∼99%. The reusability of the recovered metal products and the DES were also assessed for a closed-loop recycling process. At the outset, the proposed process paves the way for a greener alternative for recycling valuable metals from EoL LIBs rather than conventional acid-based leaching processes.

This study is establishing an environment friendly method for metals leaching from LiBs utilizing glycine (NH2CH2COOH) as a leaching agent. Li dissolution is being investigated as a function of time, pulp density, glycine concentration, and temperature. The results are evincing the leaching of Li (around 94%) using 2 M glycine at 75 °C temperature, 50 g/L pulp density and 120 min mixing time. Response surface methodology (RSM) techniques are being employed to enhance the standard hydrometallurgical process. The kinetics of Li leaching are well fitted with the “chemical reaction-controlled process” equation of the shrinking core model (1 - (1 - x) 1/3 = kt) and the energy of activation is found to be 23.69 kJ/mol. Moreover, the economic evaluation of the leaching process reveals that at optimum conditions, the average profit response for treated metals is 2394.56 USD per tonne of black powder. Therefore, the use of glycine as a green extractant not only augmenting the leaching efficiency but also minimizing the usage of inorganic acids, proffering a better alternative for green recovery of waste LiBs in future.

To address this issue, we propose an innovative hybrid strategy based on the characterization of SLIBCs, which includes pretreatment and an evaluation of the effect of visible light on one-step bacterial leaching of SLIBCs. This research presents, for the first time, an evaluation of the impact of visible light on the semiconducting properties of SLIBC and its potential to enhance extracellular electron transfer (EET) between the heterotrophic bacterium Bacillus foraminis and the waste. This increased electron transfer leads to more efficient metal bioleaching. In this strategy, we applied a novel bio-chemical pretreatment to modify the powder structure, considering the high metal content in the waste. This novel approach utilized metabolites from the spent medium of Bacillus foraminis cultures at pH∼5.4 and H2O2 (15% (v/v)). A pulp density of 10 g/L, a duration of 48 h, and a temperature of 60 °C resulted in the extraction of 98% of the manganese content. Subsequently, we assessed the bioleaching of pretreated SLIBC under both visible light and darkness conditions. Results indicate that, under 15,000 lux for 6 days, we achieved acceptable extraction rates: 68% Cu, 41% Li, 25% Co, and 16% Ni. In contrast, in darkness, extraction rates were notably lower, at 23% Cu, 9.9% Li, 3.9% Co, and 2.6% Ni. The increased extraction efficiency under visible light can be attributed to the proposed mechanism of light's effect on enhancing extracellular electron transfer between bacteria and SLIBC with semiconducting properties. FTIR, XRD, and FE-SEM analyses were also instrumental in understanding the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.

During the initial phase, AI is not employed. A precise and rapid-response microcontroller, namely the FPGA, is utilized. The performance of the FPGA is experimentally investigated under various operation conditions. In the second phase, AI plays a crucial role in enhancing both the reliability and economic effectiveness of the system. The multi-objective snake optimization (SO) algorithm is employed to attain high technical and economic performance within predefined constraints. Three objective functions are involved in this phase, focusing on the minimization of operational costs, loss of power supply probability (LPSP), and electrical energy losses in the dummy load. In the third level, a novel control strategy-based coordinated model predictive control is presented as part of the proposed AI-embedded energy management strategy. A hybrid optimization algorithm combining the multilayer feed-forward neural networks (MFFNN) and SO algorithms is proposed to predict the output power of backup sources. The microgrid under consideration is supported by a hybrid backup system comprising battery energy storage systems (BESS), electric vehicle (EV) batteries, and fuel cells (FCs). The effectiveness of this hybrid algorithm is evaluated through comparison with many other algorithms, aiming to assess its performance in accurately predicting the output power of backup sources. The results show the feasibility of using AI to achieve efficient operation and energy management in microgrids.

SPOTTER has been chosen because, compared to other approaches, it is the only one that allows for an assessment along the full supply chain and it is integrated into the Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment framework. To decrease the respective data acquisition efforts for the here-performed supply risk analysis of entire sectors, in a first step, material/product flows that are most influential for an assessment with SPOTTER are identified and considered for the calculation of related impact scores. Our study analyzes critical material and product flows between trade partner countries along relevant supply chains. It thus identifies new hotspots and adds relevant country-specific information to current knowledge. In particular, the identified hotspots refer to volatile prices of solar panels, interrupted trade of oil and gas from Russia, Nigeria and Niger as well as disrupted imports of electronic devices from China. Suggestions for mitigation strategies comprise hedging and/or diversifying the supply chains. Other identified hotspots refer to the critical supply of cobalt and natural graphite along battery supply chains, which could for example be addressed by supporting and/or incentivizing the construction of a circular economy. A third category of identified hotspots indicates risks related to the trade of hafnium and nuclear power plant equipment that could be mitigated by shifting to less risky energy technologies. Our comparisons of overall impacts between relevant technologies suggest higher supply risks for conventional cars, solar panels and Chinese laptops compared to battery electric cars, wind turbines and German laptops. In these comparisons, more details regarding disruptions along full product and fuel supply chains are considered than in current studies.";"2024-10-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624032591";"0";"Batteries

In the present work a novel method is proposed to repurpose e-waste and bio-waste into a single-chamber and mediator-less microbial fuel cells using dead, non-rechargeable D-type dry batteries. The carbonaceous material inside the dry batteries was replaced with kitchen waste sludge, which served as the substrate. The outer zinc casing was also reused as the anode and the carbon rod as the cathode. Treating the kitchen waste sludge with dilute nitric acid improved the performance of the microbial fuel cells by enhancing the biodegradability and conductivity of the substrate. The untreated microbial fuel cells produced a maximum power density of 15.0 mW/kg at a maximum current density of 50.0 mA/kg, while the treated microbial fuel cells achieved 67.0 mW/kg at 178.0 mA/kg. The main mechanism behind the working of the device is the combined action of galvanic and microbial processes, which synergistically generate electricity from e-waste and bio-waste.

Using a unified modelling framework and firm-level data from Ireland over 2020–2022, it provides novel evidence on complementarities between the use of digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) and the propensity of firms to adopt ICT-related environmental sustainability measures. The results indicate that the adoption of ICT-related sustainability measures has been uneven across groups of firms, sectors, and regions. The descriptive evidence shows that the most adopted measures are disposing of or recycling ICT equipment while the least adopted measures are measures to reduce the energy consumption of ICT equipment. The estimation results indicate that digitalisation is associated with a higher propensity of firms to adopt ICT-related sustainability practices over and above other firm characteristics such as firm size, employing ICT specialists, and investing in intangible assets. Firms using AI are more likely to adopt ICT-related sustainability practices.

However, because waste enameled wires are typically recovered from e-waste, a minor number of wires and cables are usually present. As a result, co-pyrolysis of the paint film and wire and cable sheaths is inevitable during the pyrolysis recovery of waste enameled wires. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) polyester enameled wire and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) were chosen as representatives of enameled wire and cable sheath materials, respectively. The pyrolysis characteristics and pyrolysis kinetic parameters of enameled PET (EPET) wire paint, PVC, and Mixture (a mixture of the two materials, mEPET: mPVC = 9:1) were investigated using TG and various kinetic analysis methods. The combined pyrolysis index and Py-GC/MS were used to assess the co-pyrolysis of EPET and PVC and the products. The pyrolysis of EPET is adversely affected by the presence of PVC throughout the process; however, the presence of Cu in EPET may facilitate the HCl removal reaction of PVC. The co-pyrolysis products of EPET and PVC are more complex, and according to the different main functional groups, can be divided into monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phenols, ketones, aldehydes, alcohols, esters, carboxylic acids, chlorides, and others. Finally, density functional theory calculations were used to explore the co-pyrolysis mechanism of PET and PVC as well as the creation mechanism of various pyrolysis products. The catalytic mechanism of Cu contained in EPET on PET and PVC was explained from the perspective of electrostatic potential. This study provides a theoretical foundation and comprehensive reference for the pyrolysis and recycling of waste enameled wires.

In response to this challenge, the integration of deep learning classifiers emerges as a promising avenue to optimize the planning of e-waste collection. By harnessing the capabilities of deep learning, these classifiers yield enriched navigational insights, facilitating more informed asset allocation and strategic interventions. This synthesis of technology-driven planning holds the potential to address the intricate intricacies of e-waste in a sustainable environmental landscape. Furthermore, the identification of important parts in e-waste helps in improving recycling processes, adding to a more maintainable and harmless ecosystem. To improve the potential efficiency and accuracy in waste collection the proposed methodology of Adaptive V3 and Federated Learning (Adaptive V3 and FL) are proposed to optimize e-waste collecting planning. The Inception V3 structure can enhance the classification of the e-waste, also the L2 regularization is utilized to overcome the overfitting issues. Also, federated learning is employed to improve the performance of the Inception V3 with the L2 Regularization approach. The datasets like the Starter e-waste dataset and the Compressed E-waste dataset are employed for the e-waste classification. The performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, and f1-score are utilized for the classification. The overall performance achieved by the proposed method is 98.9 % and this maximized the performance than existing approaches such as DCNN, DLRNN, LSTM as well as BSFC which attained 78.4 %, 78.1 %, 58.6 %, and 39.4 % respectively.

The proposed location-allocation model is a bi-objective mixed-integer non-linear model that maximises waste collection and minimises the cost of collection. The model considers that both drop-off and pick-up policies are in place, i.e., people can either drop their e-waste at a collection centre or request doorstep pick-up of their e-waste. The model considers that people's decision to drop off their e-waste at the collection centres depends on the financial incentive offered by the firm and the distance of the collection centre. However, in the case of pick-up, no incentive is provided, and it is considered that the households' willingness to return depends on people's concern for environmental degradation. The proposed model decides the location of the collection centre, the assignment of customer nodes, the incentive offered, and the e-waste collected using both pick-up and drop-off methods. Instances generated using a real case of Delhi, India, demonstrate the feasibility and validity of the proposed model, and the epsilon constraint method is employed to handle its multi-objectivity.

A scoping review was conducted to ascertain the current state of research regarding consumer behavior in handling WEEE concerning circular or transformational and linear behaviors. By evaluating 122 articles from databases including Scopus, Web of Science (WoS), and ProQuest the findings reveal a notable focus on three key strategies among the 9 R framework: recycle, repair, and reuse. Recycling emerges as the predominant area of research, while circular transformation strategies and linear concepts are also explored. Unexpectedly, concrete consumer action strategies are underrepresented, with a primary emphasis on companies and governments. As consumers are recognized as crucial actors within the circular economy (CE), this paper terms this contradictory state as the Circular Value Chain Blind Spot. Addressing future research, the paper concludes with a comprehensive research agenda encompassing six key areas: nudging, differentiation, systemic perspective, waste hierarchy, value chain strategies, and cultural factors.

There is evidence that the e-waste sector in developing countries applies various urban mining techniques to recover valuable resources from their waste. Urban mining techniques have shown multiple signs of progress across developing countries. Still, studies have yet to be carried out to examine the state-of-the-art barriers, drivers, or technologies in this field. Furthermore, research on this topic must be more cohesive, multi-faceted, and conclusive. An in-depth review of current practices would improve urban mining's significance and assist in understanding its current implementation levels across developing countries. Based on a systematic review of 45 peer-reviewed articles, this study examines the drivers, barriers, and technologies influencing urban mining techniques in developing countries. In developing countries, urban mining stages are affected by laws, policies, market risks, and technological solutions. Developing countries must sharpen their skills in sustainable technologies, regulatory systems, and policy initiatives to overcome barriers and maximise their returns on urban mining investments.

Efforts to overcome e-waste in the context of circular economy exist, but a lack of agreement among researchers and practitioners' challenges how to best measure success in the e-waste circular economy. This study aims to address critical success factors (CSFs) of the e-waste circular economy to assess the maturity levels of urban mining. Maturity levels of urban mining are developed by employing Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that derive from how well CSFs are executed. The maturity level is modeled by adding all scores of KPIs aligned with CSFs. Automatic Content Analysis is used to extract keywords and interpret the relationship among keywords to form initial factors in CSFs from a set of related articles on e-waste management. These initial factors are further analyzed by subject experts using facet analysis to construct KPIs in line with the CSFs. The experts' score determines the maturity level of urban mining: initial, emerging, developing, established, and mature. From the experiment, we found seven factors in CSFs and 34 indicators in KPIs. Three countries (Indonesia, India, and Japan) were used as the trials of the assessment of urban mining maturity level. Indonesia's urban mining maturity level is considered emerging with a score of 54, and the same score is reflected in India. With a score of 114, Japan has reached an established stage. Furthermore, the results of urban mining maturity level assessment can be used as guidance to choose and prioritize SDGs.

The global accumulation of electronic waste (e-waste) is increasing, accompanied by a lack of sustainable disposal methods due to the limited implementation of Circular Economy (CE) principles such as recycling and responsible resource exploitation. While there has been an observed increase in environmental awareness among individuals over the past decade, particularly among the demographic known as “Millennials,” there is a dearth of study pertaining to their electronic trash disposal practises. Furthermore, there is a need to investigate the influence of external factors such as Electronic word of mouth (eWOM) and perceived Usage of Online collection portal. Consequently, the present study has put forth a theoretical framework in order to investigate the perceived behavior of millennials towards the disposal of electronic trash (E-waste). The purpose of the theory of planned behavior (TPB) is to anticipate the perceived e-waste disposal behavior of millennials. This objective was empirically tested using a sample size of 305 respondents using structural equation modelling. The results indicate a positive correlation between millennials' intentions to dispose of e-waste and their attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. The emergence of electronic eWOM has been recognized as an important factor in earlier research. In this study, we have examined the moderating influence of eWOM on E-waste disposal behavior.

This study proposes an integrated solution of energy storage and CO2 reduction highlighted by trans-critical compressed CO2 energy storage systems (CCES). The system is developed by combining liquified natural gas (LNG) cold energy utilization and cryogenic carbon capture unit. To demonstrate the applicability of the developed system, two cases of gaseous and liquid phase in low-pressure storage tanks are designed and analyzed in terms of energy, exergy and life cycle techno-economics. In addition, since the system includes the capture and utilization of CO2, a green emission incentive is introduced in the form of a social cost of carbon to go through the techno-economic analysis. It is indicated that the energy, exergy and emission reduction potential of the two cases can outperform the conventional CO2 energy storage system combined cooling, heating and power at a peak time of 12 h.

A use-phase carbon emissions assessment can help electric vehicle designers and manufacturers analyze the onboard carbon footprint and mitigate vehicle-related carbon emissions through energy consumption optimization. In this article, we focus on the use-phase carbon footprint based on the energy losses in electric vehicle battery packs. A battery pack energy loss model is established to examine the carbon footprint of four main subsystems of the battery pack, including the energy storage system, thermal management system, and battery junction box. We use the proposed method to evaluate the battery pack use-phase carbon emissions in four different cities from four main continents. The results show that the highest emissions appear in Tokyo (436.2 kgCO2) due to the relatively high greenhouse gas factor on the grid, the London has the lowest 207.5 kgCO2 emissions due to the massive adoption of sustainable energy during power generation. With a similar high greenhouse gas factor, but Sydney shows lower emissions (347.5 kgCO2) compared to Tokyo, which illustrates the closer the annual average temperature to the battery suitable operation range, the lower energy loss happens inside the battery pack due to the low thermal management load and resistance energy loss in the cells. This electric vehicle has the highest energy loss rate (20.8%) in New York, 343.6 kgCO2 emissions, and the highest thermal management system energy losses show the high seasonal temperature difference causing the high thermal management load to maintain the battery temperature.

However, the rapid increase in battery manufacturing, without adequate consideration of the carbon emissions associated with their production and material demands, poses the threat of shifting the bulk of emissions upstream. In this article, a life cycle assessment (LCA) model is developed to account for the cradle-to-gate carbon footprint of lithium-ion batteries across 26 Chinese provinces, 20 North American locations and 19 countries in Europe and Asia. Analysis of published LCA data reveals significant uncertainty associated with the carbon emissions of key battery materials; their overall contribution to the carbon footprint of a LIB varies by a factor of ca. 4 depending on production route and source. The links between production location and the gate-to-gate carbon footprint of battery manufacturing are explored, with predicted median values ranging between 0.1 and 69.5 kg CO2-eq kWh−1. Leading western-world battery manufacturing locations in the US and Europe, such as Kentucky and Poland are found to have comparable carbon emissions to Chinese rivals, even exceeding the carbon emissions of battery manufacturing in several Chinese provinces. Such resolution on material and energy contributions to the carbon footprint of LIBs is essential to inform policy- and decision-making to minimise the carbon emissions of the battery value chain. Given the current status quo, the global carbon footprint of the lithium-ion battery industry is projected to reach up to 1.0 Gt CO2-eq per year within the next decade.

The effective operation of an integrated energy system necessitates a thorough examination of demand-side load, the dynamic performance of the energy supply system, the configuration of energy storage systems, local electricity pricing policies, and operational or control strategies for the system. It confronts substantial challenges in practical application. Considering the noteworthy performance variations of comprehensive energy systems under diverse demand-side load, fluctuating electricity prices, and various operating modes of energy storage equipment, this paper initially conducts a practical analysis of demand-side load. A comprehensive energy system with multi-energy complementary based on source-load-storage coordination (SLS-CES) model was constructed.

An in-depth analysis of the thermal performance, environmental performance, and economic performance of the system in the full-year dimension and typical daily dimension under this operating strategy was conducted. The results show that under this operation strategy, the system's annual net income is 415.90 thousand yuan, of which the system's energy storage battery power supply revenue during peak period reaches 254.40 thousand yuan.

This paper studies the effect of five PS technologies with different operational flexibility in Qinghai Province's energy system. Firstly, PS models considering the difference in minimum stable generation & pumping, unit efficiency, configurations of turbine & pump are established. Then, the energy mixes, planning capacity, inflow, reservoir operation curve and other data are input into the energy system model. Finally, we quantify the effects of different PS forms on the energy system based on technical, economic, and emission indicators, also identify the optimal PS considering cost preference and emission preference. Results show that the investment costs for various pumped storage technologies depend on the motor type and pump capacity. Fixed-speed pump turbine technologies have a lower cumulative power variation of up to 11,225 GWh and the largest number of start-ups in pumping conditions, at 10,857 times. Increasing operational flexibility stabilizes the reservoir water level, and enhancing pump capacity reduces net load fluctuations for ternary PS and variable-speed quaternary PS. Improving wind-solar curtailment is limited by pump capacity, generating flexibility, and reservoir water level.

SimaPro v. 9.0.0.49 was used for the analysis, whereas inventory data were collected from databases, such as Ecoinvent 3, Transportation Energy Databook, Greet model 2022, and published papers. The results showed that CED and GHG associated with the coir fiber-reinforced composite part were lower than the glass fiber-reinforced composite part for both cradle-to-gate (∼34–40%) and cradle-to-grave (excluding end-of-life) (∼24%) analysis.

We explored the spatial heterogeneity of carbon emissions (CEs) and its impact mechanism based on carbon emission data from prefecture level cities in China from 1997 to 2017, using methods such as spatial autocorrelation model, centroid model, and geographically weighted regression. The results show that the national average CEs was 6522.98 million tons from 1997 to 2017. CEs were higher in the northeast and lower in the southwest of China. The main types of local spatial autocorrelation were high-high (H-H) and low-low (L-L), indicating that the high-value and low value areas of carbon emissions exhibit spatial clustering characteristics, respectively. The gravity center of the CEs shifted 128.48 km to the southwest during the study period. The general public budget expenditure, energy consumption per unit of GDP, and population density significantly influenced the spatial distribution of CEs. In over 70% of the study area, these factors, along with GDP per capita, have a positive impact on carbon emissions. These findings provide an important theoretical basis for China to achieve its “double carbon” goal by the middle of this century and are particularly useful for promoting green and low-carbon growth in developing countries across the world.

However, the harmful emissions generated during their production and construction processes have a considerable negative impact on the environment. This study introduced composite fume suppression and deodorizing agents (CSDAs), formulating four distinct fume suppression and deodorizing rubber modified asphalts (SDRMAs). Microscale testing methods were employed to analyze the micro-morphology, physicochemical properties, and thermal stability of SDRMA. Fume tests were conducted to evaluate the fume suppression performance of CSDA, and the emission behavior and suppression mechanisms were investigated using mass balance methods and electrochemical sensors. Additionally, the high and low-temperature rheological properties and storage stability of SDRMA were comprehensively analyzed using tools such as the dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) and bending beam rheometer (BBR). The results indicated that CSDA effectively suppressed the harmful emissions of rubber modified asphalt (RMA). Compared to regular RMA, the four types of SDRMAs demonstrated a reduction in average fume emissions, particulate matter mass, and H2S gas concentration by 40.1%, 21.6%, and 47.0%, respectively. Furthermore, the addition of CSDA improved the high-temperature performance and storage stability of the modified asphalt, effectively reducing the environmental hazards and energy consumption during the production and storage of RMA, thereby facilitating the eco-friendly application and energy-saving emission reduction of RMA.

This study explores the use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) in the alumina extraction industry. Models for various thermal energy supply methods and CO2 mitigation strategies were developed to obtain an inventory for analysis and the environmental impacts and life-cycle costs of the supply chain were evaluated. Finally, economic and ecological results were integrated using eco-efficiency indices and a sensitivity analysis of the most significant variables detected was conducted. The research indicated that the integration of a calcium-looping plant to capture post-combusted CO2 could reduce 55.5% of the CO2 equivalent emissions, while also obtaining a better economic performance due to the CO2 avoided taxes. However, other environmental indicators had slightly more significant impacts because of the additional use of natural gas. The potential use of green hydrogen instead of natural gas could enable a 70.0% reduction in CO2 equivalent emissions, as well as a reduction in all other environmental indicators studied, except for water consumption. However, transitioning to green hydrogen production could incur higher costs. This study introduced an eco-efficiency ratio index, indicating that CO2 capture and storage proved to be the most eco-efficient scenario, regardless of economic fluctuations in CO2 emission taxes. The substitution of natural gas with green hydrogen also emerged as a viable eco-efficient solution, provided electricity prices remain below 0.045€/kWh.";"2024-12-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624038150";"1";"Emissions"

This study compiled extended inter-country input-output (ICIO) tables, linking 14 major sectors across 67 economies with methane emissions data from 2000 to 2018. We identified high-emission linkages between sectors, analyzed the evolution of China's methane emissions structure within these linkages, and explored the underlying reasons for inter-annual methane emissions changes. Our findings reveal that China's role in the emissions embedded in international trade networks has become significant, forming an Asian emission community, with its methane emissions embedded in import trade exceeding those in export trade by 2018. China's methane emissions from domestic production accounted for over 95% of total emissions, with the top-5 key linkages contributing to more than 50% of domestic production emissions. Per capita GDP emerged as a key driver of increasing methane emissions in these linkages, while emission intensity reduction had the opposite impact, albeit with a diminishing effect. Moreover, simulations of three scenarios indicated that emission intensity reduction is the most effective for methane emission reduction. We estimated that by 2025, the emission intensity in the energy mining and production sector, agriculture sector, and waste treatment and discharge sector would decrease to 0.0086, 0.0029, and 0.0014, respectively. This could potentially reduce over 65% of the emissions embedded in China's top-5 key linkages of export trade and four of the top-5 linkages of domestic production by 2025, compared to 2018 levels. Based on this analysis, several potential directions for methane emissions reduction in China were proposed.

This study examines the carbon emissions of 111 resource-based cities in China from 2011 to 2019. Using two-way fixed-effects and instrumental variables models, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the digital economy for the low-carbon transition of resource-based cities, revealing a “green paradox.” Specifically, the digital economy reduces the carbon intensity of resource-based cities by decreasing their dependence on natural resources. However, as energy consumption increases, carbon emissions scale also rise. Our analysis identifies changes in industrial structure and green innovation as potential catalysts for this paradox. Further analysis reveals that the impact of the digital economy varies across different types of resource-based cities. The results indicate that only in declining and regenerating cities does the digital economy significantly reduce carbon emission intensity, while there is no evidence that it reduces the overall scale of carbon emissions, regardless of city type. Drawing on these findings, the study puts forth policy recommendations to steer resource-based cities in their transition toward a low-carbon future.

In Australia, agriculture accounts for approximately 16.8% of total emissions. Despite advancements in emissions accounting, critical gaps remain, particularly concerning the data-driven selection of reference years and the use of aggregated metrics. These issues often overlook sectoral dynamics, highlighting the need for context-specific, disaggregated baselines that more accurately reflect the complexities of emission assessment from agriculture. This study presents an analytical methodology that integrates machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically dynamic Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) and Conditional Inference Trees (CITs). Applied to 30 years of CO2-e data from Australian inventories, the ML-based approach predicted significant periods of aggregated emissions: from 1990 to 2005 and from 2006 to 2022, with 2005 identified as a critical transition point. The analysis revealed a significant decline in aggregated emissions, with a median of 70.5 Mt CO2-e over the past five years, down from a peak of 76.4 Mt CO2-e estimated in 2005. By optimising the bias-variance trade-off, the algorithms effectively captured underlying patterns while accounting for variability due to climate-related extreme events, such as the Millennium Drought. Another key contribution of this research is the establishment of accurate and adaptable sector- and activity-level baselines, which enhance decision-making related to resource allocation and performance targets. Although applied to Australian agricultural emissions data, this methodology has global applicability. As climate variability intensifies, its predictive and benchmarking capabilities can improve the utility of historical data, supporting dynamic, data-driven approaches crucial for facilitating the net-zero transition.";"2024-12-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624038654";"0";"Emissions"

These act indirectly on carbon emissions by shaping behaviour. Outcomes include energy/emissions mitigation or, growth through rebound effects, where energy savings are offset by increasing demand for energy. In this study we use meta-regression techniques to quantify the relative strength of different impact mechanisms on emissions for a diverse set of digital innovations. We use data from two key synthesis studies, providing 135 estimates of impact across 22 different digital consumer innovations. We measure impacts using different metrics including activity, energy use, or carbon emissions (CO2/CO2 eq). We refer to these as “emissions-related outcomes”. We find strong evidence that impact mechanisms explain differences in emissions-related outcomes between digital consumer innovations. Digital consumer innovations that influence behaviour by technology ‘substitution’ e.g., food gamification apps, have a significantly larger impact (44% reduction) than those that ‘coordinate’ e.g., food pairing apps (17% reduction) or those that that improve ‘control’ e.g., smart home appliances (20% reduction). Estimates of impact included in energy studies are highly sensitive to boundary decisions and assumptions made by researchers, introducing further uncertainties into their magnitude and direction. When we control for variation in study design such as whether emissions-related outcomes data were collected using field experiments, or simulations we find that differences between impact mechanisms are amplified. A further key finding is that impact mechanisms explain more of the difference between-innovations than deployment context. Our novel approach of classifying innovations by the underlying causal mechanism through which they change user behaviour and so energy emissions adds a new dimension to methodological work on indirect impacts for which system boundary and variable definition are not fixed. Identifying causal mechanisms with the largest benefits for emissions reduction also guides policy, innovators, service providers, and digital users concerned with carbon footprint.";"2024-12-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624038617";"3";"Emissions"

This trend is stimulated by increasingly stringent regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the transportation sector. However, in agriculture, the adoption of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) is not aligned with the trends seen in other sectors due to technological barriers. Currently, only a few prototypal solutions for hybrid tractors have emerged due to their advantages in battery size, weight, and cost compared to fully electric solutions. In the literature, few studies have examined the environmental performance of hybrid electric tractors (HETs), mainly comparing them to conventional models in terms of work performance. Conversely, the user perspective is scarcely addressed although users' needs vary significantly depending on farm dimensions and cultivation types. The study proposes an analysis of the environmental impact of a hybrid solution by comparing it with a diesel engine Stage V and one produced under the Stage IIIb requirements. The novelty of this paper results from combining the life cycle assessment (LCA) outputs with a scenario modelling framework to uncover the potential environmental impact of the three models considering different use scenarios. Such an approach goes beyond traditional LCA analyses by providing more detailed information on the practical environmental implications related to these propulsion units. The results show that depending on the user scenario, the hybrid solution is not always the least pollutant, thus requiring further research in the HET sector to better tailor technical solutions based on the target customer.

This study compares the greenhouse gas emissions of older and newer trawlers in the Icelandic fleet, using Life Cycle Assessment methodology with the functional unit “1 kg of demersally trawled fish at landing”. The global warming potential (kg CO2-eq) from older Icelandic bottom trawlers was assessed and compared to the newer ones, where older vessels were in some cases being decommissioned. A total of 11 trawlers were assessed, providing a cross section of the Icelandic bottom trawler fleet, with respect to age, size, catch composition and onboard operations. The results show that freezer trawling was more energy-intensive compared to trawlers landing their catches chilled/superchilled. Fleet renewal alone does not explain the reduction in fuel use and greenhouse gas emissions in the Icelandic bottom trawl fleet between 2012 and 2022, highlighting the need for a comprehensive approach considering multiple factors such as catch composition, fishing ground, and vessel characteristics, which explained 87% of the emissions. Catching indicated increased fuel consumption compared to steaming. The greenhouse gas emissions allocated to each demersal fish species ranged on average from 0.5 to 1.0 kg CO2-eq/kg of the weight of demersal fish landed, and from 1.4 to 2.7 kg CO2-eq/kg of the edible part of demersal fish landed (mass allocation), where redfish stood out as having the highest emissions.";"2024-12-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624036941";"2";"Emissions"

The models used were Ensemble Decision Tree Bagging, Ensemble Least Squares Boosting, Gaussian Process Regression and Support Vector Machine Regression, with good generalization ability. Brake Specific Fuel Consumption data from the test engine trials and endoscopic image flame area data after spark timing at different crank angles (320, 400, 480, 560, and 640 after Spark Timing) were fed into the machine-learning models as predictors. The response variables were Brake thermal efficiency, Unburnt Hydrocarbons, Carbon monoxide, Carbon dioxide, Oxides of nitrogen, maximum In-cylinder pressure, and maximum heat release rate. The bootstrap technique was used to generate numerous datasets from the experimental data for data-driven model training and tested using both interpolative and extrapolative data. The experimental and predicted values for all these algorithms were subjected to repeated hyperparameter optimization trials and the best machine learning method was identified using the performance and error metrics. The Ensemble Least Squares Boost model showed the overall best correlation (R2) in the range of 0.97–0.99 for gasoline and pine oil PN20 blend for the predicted versus experimental engine parameters. The root-mean-squared error (RMSE) at maximum load ranged between 0.0086 and 0.3044 for gasoline and 0.0049–0.2046 for the Pine oil PN20 fuel blend respectively. Therefore, employing an Ensemble Least Squares Boosting machine learning framework can effectively predict the characteristics of gasoline engines using pine oil and blends.

The costs will naturally influence the market competitiveness. In this paper, we propose the concept of an equivalent emission standard (EES) tax as a complement to traditional standards, linking the tax rate to the abatement cost for firms under the optimal carbon emission standard and providing tax revenue for the government. To study the optimal carbon related regulation mode and the relevant impacts in oligopoly, we compare four potential carbon related regulations: an emission tax (an emission approach tax), a carbon tax (a fuel approach tax), an emission standard and an EES tax. Incorporating a sequential game analysis, we show that policy effects are relevant to the magnitude of carbon pollution and the abatement cost in the short term. In general, the optimal levels of social welfare under emission tax and carbon tax modes are the same. Notably, the EES tax system can not only generate tax revenue but also has a relatively moderate impact on social welfare. If the social damage resulting from carbon emissions is large, the EES tax system will be comparatively more beneficial to society, but the advantage is limited in terms of the relevant abatement cost. In the long term, under certain conditions, excessive firm entry may occur. As a result, carbon related regulation can be an indirect instrument of entry deterrence in the market.

This is achieved through mechanisms such as sharing carbon reduction costs and promoting decarbonization on both the supply and demand sides. Furthermore, improving carbon governance can enhance the green competitiveness of Chinese products.

Traditional manufacturing methods for (polylactic acid) PLA plastic products involve IM, which require extensive equipment and metal molds to be manufactured first. This process involves repetitive heating and machining, low material utilization, high energy consumption, and high pollution. 3D printing using a gradual accumulation of materials to manufacture parts has transformed traditional manufacturing methods. However, concerns regarding the environmental impact of 3D printing have been raised in previous studies. To achieve sustainability in 3D printing, it is important to make effective adjustments by predicting the carbon emissions before printing. In this study, we propose a method for predicting carbon emissions from 3D printing by integrating processing characteristics with G-code instructions. The deviation of the model was confirmed to be between 3.86 % and 5.82 % through a case study of FDM 3D printing. The optimal process parameters were determined from carbon emissions predictions, resulting in carbon emissions reductions of up to 43.77 % . Carbon emissions were evaluated using both the traditional IM method and FDM 3D printing for manufacturing PLA plastic products. The results showed that the carbon emissions from FDM were significantly lower than those from traditional IM in small batches or customized production. In the traditional IM method, mold manufacturing produces high carbon emissions, accounting for more than 99 % of the entire process. The findings of this study offer valuable guidance to manufacturers in selecting appropriate manufacturing methods and formulating production strategies. By predicting carbon emissions in the FDM process and adjusting the parameters based on product quality requirements, significant reductions in carbon emissions can be achieved during the production of small batches or customized PLA plastic products.

The findings reveal a non-linear relationship in which improvements in IQ generally decrease CE-I, particularly in contexts of weak governance; however, diminishing returns are observed at higher IQ levels. Income exhibits an inverted U-shaped effect on CE-I, where economic growth initially increases emissions inequality but moderates it at higher income levels. Robustness checks employing quantile Granger causality tests, quantile regression, and Kernel-based regularized least squares demonstrate that both IQ and income levels play significant roles in shaping CE-I patterns. Based on these findings, specific policy actions are recommended: in contexts of weak governance, policies should prioritize strengthening IQ to reduce CE-I, while in high-income countries, efforts should focus on promoting equitable income distribution to manage the growth-inequality relationship. Targeted interventions are essential to ensuring both environmental sustainability and social justice in reducing CE-I.";"2024-12-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624036643";"6";"Emissions"

Reductions in the carbon emission intensity (CEI) can support ecologically and economically sustainable development efforts in developing countries. In this study, exploratory data analysis was used to investigate the spatial correlation characteristics of the CEI in the Yangtze River Delta, and the network of economic, data, and innovation flows was constructed via a gravity model. The heterogeneity impact of factor flows on CEI was analyzed via the extended STIRPAT model as multiple factors needed consideration. The results show that the CEI decreased from 0.375 tons/million yuan in 2010 to 0.173 tons/million yuan in 2022, with an average annual decrease of 6.719%, a significant positive spatial correlation, and an overall spatial pattern of decentralized distribution for low-value zones and banded agglomeration for high-value zones. Multidimensional factor flow was active, with the unbalanced development characteristics of “dense in the middle and sparse in the north and south” and a chain network “centered on the capital city of the province as the center of the preferential phase chain, multicenter flow”. Data flow was the main factor influencing the change in CEI, followed by innovation flow and economic flow. However, the influence of industrial structure and landscape construction on CEI should not be neglected. This study deepens the understanding of the relationship between multidimensional factor flow and CEI. They can be used to build a platform for data circulation and technology transfer and promote integrated economic development.

Residential photovoltaic systems emerged as a prominent, clean energy solution, drawing attention for their carbon-neutral electricity generation. Despite this, concerns persisted over whether technological advancements and policy incentives could sustain efforts to conserve energy and reduce emissions, particularly in light of the Jevons Paradox, which posits that technological progress might increase energy consumption and counteract emission reductions. This study, grounded in self-identity theory, examined the influence of residential PV installation on household electricity conservation behavior and assessed the paradox's relevance in this context. Through a survey across three representative Chinese provinces, collecting 996 responses, the research utilized Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze the data. Findings revealed that PV installation and usage among residents bolstered self-consistency, social identity, and identity affirmation, indirectly encouraging electricity conservation. Economic incentives and environmental campaigns were both shown to increase residential PV adoption and subsequent electricity-saving actions. However, economic incentives were found to be more effective, suggesting that economic benefits primarily influenced residents' energy consumption behaviors. Interestingly, a lower inclination for electricity conservation among higher-income residents hinted at the Jevons paradox (or a rebound effect). The study's findings underscore the importance of crafting energy and environmental policies that balance economic incentives with long-term environmental awareness strategies. It also suggests that reinforcing residents' identities as environmental advocates could enhance engagement in green energy practices, offering valuable insights for China and other nations striving to promote residential PV systems and meet emission reduction goals.

Current monitoring schemes have limited effect in real-time carbon emission monitoring while the development of Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and emission factors for carbon-related devices introduces a fresh outlook. Hence, a method based on carbon-related load monitoring in AMI is proposed. The proposed method comprises three essential components: the one-hot component, the random convolution component, and the grid search component. The one-hot component can transform multi-state and multi-device identification into multi-classification problems, making CO 2 emissions calculations easier for industrial users. The random convolution component effectively distinguishes the electricity characteristics to identify various states of carbon-related devices, while the grid search component optimizes hyperparameters to enhance recognition accuracy and decrease carbon emission monitoring errors. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated through experiments conducted on several industrial users. Comparative analysis with alternative methods demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed approach, indicating its effectiveness in accurately estimating carbon emissions for industrial users on these metrics including ACC, Recall micro , Recall macro , Precision micro , Precision macro , F 1 micro and F 1 macro .

It is noteworthy that few studies have examined their collective impact on decreasing CEI from a comparative perspective among wealthy and poor nations, which is crucial for the formulation of targeted policy recommendations. Additionally, it also examines whether FDI moderates the mitigating effect of green technology innovation on CEI. Methodologically, multiplied models of pooled ordinary least square (OLS), two-way fixed effect, random effect, and fixed effect are employed to undertake asymmetric impact analysis. The endogeneity problem is addressed using both the System generalized method of moments (GMM) model and the instrumental variable approach. There is an interesting discovery: the marginal reduction effect of renewable energy consumption on CEI is much stronger in emerging countries with higher CEI compared to developed countries. Furthermore, implementing green technology innovation leads to a noticeable reduction in CEI in developed and developing countries, but the latter is still more effective. Moreover, FDI has a Pollution Haven effect on CEI in poor countries, whereas the anticipated Pollution Halo effect does not materialize in wealthy nations. Also, FDI acts as a mediator, reducing the adverse effects of green technology innovation on CEI in developing countries. This suggests that both Pollution Haven and Pollution Halo effects coexist in these regions, providing valuable insights into the conflicting results found in relevant studies. These findings provide practical insights for policymakers to customize successful measures to decrease CEI, especially in developing countries. Despite the substantial conflict they confront between environmental conservation and economic growth, their green measures are more effective than those of wealthy nations.

The method encompasses identifying ship motion states, extracting features, compressing time series data based on these features, and performing cluster analysis. It has been applied to process over 12.6 million data points, demonstrating its applicability to a large dataset. The results indicate that by using actual measurement data and the proposed methodology, three typical operational conditions for ships were successfully established. There are significant differences in the feature parameters among these conditions, highlighting the distinct characteristics of each operational state. The validity of the constructed typical operational conditions was confirmed through a validation process, which involved analysing the differences in feature parameters and comparing the probability distributions of speed and acceleration to the overall dataset.

The use of bio-materials along with urban densification strategies that avoid demolition and reduce material demand, have been recommended to achieve urban sustainability goals. Addressing these measures, this study compares the life cycle embodied carbon emissions of seven hybrid top-up structural systems composed of concrete, steel and advanced engineered timber products made out of softwood and hardwood species. The life cycle carbon emissions (expressed in kgCO2-eq) were estimated following a cradle-to-grave approach, with a functional unit equivalent to 1 m2 of top-up structural system and focusing on The Netherlands and the city of Amsterdam as main geographical scope. A statistical analysis was included to account for the potential variation of emissions across each life cycle stage, using Monte Carlo simulations for random sampling. The results indicate that predominantly bio-based structures present a staggering 60% lower embodied carbon emissions compared with predominantly concrete, steel and modestly hybrid systems. Preserving the long-term carbon storage capacity of timber elements through high-quality reuse can offset 30–60% of the total positive emissions of the predominantly bio-based systems. Up to 6MtCO2-eq of the national carbon budget in The Netherlands can be saved from a radical uptake of bio-based structures in Amsterdam by 2050.

Carbon price is crucial for promoting the activation of the carbon trading market and facilitating emissions reduction. However, the current carbon price has non-linear characteristics, large fluctuations, and high complexity, making accurate predictions challenging. To effectively predict the trends and the change of carbon price, this study proposed a hybrid deep learning point–interval prediction model. First, an improved variational mode decomposition–symplectic geometry mode decomposition (IVMD–SGMD) two-layer decomposition model was constructed to decompose the carbon prices into regular subsequences. Then, attention–temporal convolutional network–bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Attention-TCN-BiGRU) and Encoder–Decoder long short-term memory (LSTM) combined prediction models were constructed for the prediction of subsequences. The entropy method (EM) was used to assign weights to the predictions of two models to achieve model complementarity and a linear reconstruction of the models' results. Then the error correction was performed to obtain the final prediction results. This study conducted experiments on carbon prices in the Guangdong and Shenzhen markets. The mean absolute error (MAE) of the proposed model for the two datasets was reduced by 89.69% and 87.43% respectively lower than that for LSTM. To demonstrate the model's adaptability, prediction experiments conducted on natural gas and crude oil prices were employed, confirming its strong predictive accuracy in energy price forecasting. Based on the point prediction error, the interval prediction using the improved kernel density estimation (IKDE) provides more carbon market information for decision makers.

Efforts to reduce car dependency have led to exploration of alternative transportation options such as cableway systems in urban areas. However, limited information exists regarding the environmental impacts and biodiversity implications of such systems. This study conducted a comparative life cycle assessment between a proposed cableway system for the city of Trieste, Italy and its current car transportation mode. The analysis considered both daily operational profiles and passenger occupancy rates of the cableway system. Drawing from similar cableway systems worldwide, it was calculated that the proposed Trieste cableway would accommodate 2007 daily passengers, on average. Results from the environmental assessment revealed that the cableway's operational phase had by far the greatest impact on all environmental categories, followed by its construction and by land clearance. Additionally, the use phase was found to be the major cause for most biodiversity loss, particularly towards terrestrial ecosystems. Comparisons of life cycle GHG emissions between the cableway and car transportation indicated that the cableway system would be a preferable option if the daily average passengers would reach at least 3,908, which is almost double than the expected ones. Furthermore, the cableway system exhibited larger environmental impacts across most categories compared to current car transportation. Thus, this study challenges the perception that the cableway system is a more sustainable option compared to conventional modes of transport, as additional factors need to be considered for a broader overview of the environmental performances.";"2024-12-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624036503";"0";"Emissions"

This study explores the evolution of China's green shipping policies and regulations, with particular attention to the collaborative relationships among policy entities at different levels, their respective roles, and the changing trends in policy thematic emphasis. Over the period from 2009 to June 2022, 208 green policy documents were manually collected from the official websites of various policy entities. These documents underwent analysis using a social network analysis methodology, with variables such as density, degree centrality, betweenness centrality, n-clan, and k-core being examined. Results indicate that China's green shipping regulations have undergone significant transitions in recent years. The focus of policies has shifted from mitigating atmospheric pollutant emissions to reducing GHG emissions. Notable, there has been a greater emphasis on promoting green energy rather than solely improving energy efficiency. Governments seem increasingly inclined to implement mandatory green shipping policies over voluntary ones to ensure their practical effectiveness. Furthermore, recent decentralized administrative reforms have empowered local governments with greater decision-making authority.

The estimation considers the consumption of nonrenewable sources of energy, emissions of greenhouse gases, and other environmental resource factors that have received significantly less research attention, such as industrial land use, water use, PM2.5, SO2, NOX, and Hg emissions. The scope of this study differs from earlier ones in that it includes a comprehensive description of all the equipment, materials, and services used, as opposed to earlier studies that either omit crucial supporting infrastructure or just focus on the plant's physical structure as its primary materials. Results based on a typical plant in China show that the state-of-the-art onshore wind power systems can provide significant reductions in nonrenewable energy use (9.2 MJ/kWh) and GHG emissions (782.8 GtCO2/kWh). To produce an equivalent amount of electricity, wind power systems require more than three times industrial land use and almost one-third of industrial water use of that for traditional coal-fired power systems. The avoided SO2, Hg, PM2.5, and NOX emissions per unit of electricity generation account for 60.6%–89.3% of the total air pollution emissions induced by supercritical coal-fired power systems. By integrating 3797 operating plant-specific data and fixed-point wind energy information, this study scales up results of the single plant to a country level. The macro picture implies different opportunities born by wind power systems in easing multiple resource and environmental pressures, highlighting the significance of designing hierarchical strategies to improve penetration levels of wind power.

Evidence from a county-level quasi-natural experiment in China ";" Energy transition is essential for promoting low-carbon development, but how sub-provincial fiscal decentralization impacts urban energy transitions remains to be determined. Using county-level panel data from China for 2000–2017 and the difference-in-differences (DID) model, this study examines the mechanisms of fiscal relationships among local governments and their effects on energy transitions. The study uses China's “province-managing-county” reform (PMCR) as the starting point. Our results reveal that (Abbasi and Ahmadi Choukolaei, 2023) the PMCR has significantly promoted energy transitions through three mechanisms: increasing county-level governments' fiscal self-sufficiency and resource integration capabilities, enhancing the industrial structure and fostering green technological innovation, and increasing rural residents' income (Aziz and Bakoben, 2024). These effects are enhanced with increased agricultural mechanization, economic vitality, and provincial government attention to energy (Callaway and Sant’Anna, 2021). The PMCR contributes to reducing energy consumption disparities among counties and reducing carbon emissions (Chen et al., 2022). Clarifying county-level government expenditure responsibilities in the reform would further aid the energy transition.

The success of CCS projects hinges on accurately predicting and monitoring the CO 2 plume migration during and after injection. To address the computational burden of traditional numerical simulation methods, previous studies have used neural networks as proxy models to expedite the prediction of the CO 2 plume migration. However, these models rely on uncertain inputs, such as the distribution of heterogeneous rock permeability and porosity maps, which can lead to erroneous predictions and limit their adoption in real-world applications. To address this issue, this study introduces a framework for reconstruction and short-term prediction of CO 2 plume migration based solely on field measurements that directly provide information on the migration of the CO 2 plumes, thus eliminating the dependency on uncertain geological information as model input. The framework trains a spatio-temporal neural network model using simulated data under various geologic settings to capture the plume evolution dynamics without constraining it to a specific geological scenario. Once trained, the model integrates global and local field measurements from multiple sources to reconstruct the CO 2 plume and predict its spatio-temporal evolution. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is tested using two case studies: one using a synthetic dataset and another with data generated from a model of a real field in the Southern San Joaquin Basin.

The results indicate that the occurring electrification of the passenger fleet is an effective strategy for reducing the global warming impacts of the automotive sector in the long-term, albeit aligned with the renewable energy transformation. CE strategies are most effective in reducing CO2-eq. emissions in the short term. Particularly, CE strategies affecting the vehicle stock promise substantial reductions in CO2-eq. emissions and primary material demand, while improved collection, sorting, and recycling have a limited impact.

Based on the resource-based and dynamic capabilities view theory lens, it uses partial least square structural equation modeling and qualitative comparative analysis to explore the contribution of big data analytics-driven dynamic capabilities in innovation on environmental performance under enterprise factors and combinations of conditions. The empirical study gathered data from 319 Indian and American enterprises. The results demonstrate seven solutions with very high environmental performance, depicting core presence for big data analytics-driven dynamic capabilities in sensing, seizing, and transforming in an uncertain environment of dynamism and hostility in India and American firms. The synergy of big data analytics-enabled dynamic capabilities in sensing, seizing, and transforming shows an essential role in enhancing sustainable environmental performance for enterprises in the USA compared to those in India. Based on the configuration analyses, big data analytics significantly mitigates environmental dynamism and hostility challenges enterprises encounter. It consequently exerts a more pronounced influence on green performance, particularly within the service sector and small enterprises in the USA, through radical process innovation. Conversely, this impact is observed primarily among large product firms in India by incremental innovation strategies. This indicates that this emerging technology is essential to attend to the necessary aspects of the circular economy in developing and developed economies through specific configuration conditions.

Empirical research from a spatial spillover perspective ";" Facilitating coordination between economic growth and carbon mitigation is vital for the sustainability of human society. Identifying the driving factors of carbon emission performance (CEP) is crucial for its improvement. Nevertheless, empirical research on the relationship between advanced human capital structure (AHCS) and CEP remains scarce. This study analyzes the impact of AHCS on CEP utilizing a dataset covering 30 Chinese provinces from 2006 to 2021. First, we construct a global epsilon-based measure (EBM) model with undesired output to accurately measure the multi-period CEP for Chinese provinces. Next, we evaluate the level of AHCS from the perspective of dynamic evolution. Subsequently, a spatial Durbin model (SDM) is employed to examine the spatial spillover effects of AHCS on CEP. The results illustrate that CEP exhibits significant positive spatial spillover effects across provinces. Additionally, AHCS has a direct and significant positive impact on local CEP and can indirectly enhance CEP in neighboring regions through spillover effects, although the impact varies across different regions. The impact mechanism analysis indicates that AHCS enhances CEP via technological advancement, industrial structure upgrading (ISU), and energy efficiency improvement, despite the asymmetric effects observed between local and neighboring provinces. Therefore, shaping a favorable educational environment to optimize the human capital structure is critical for the improvement of CEP. In addition, promoting resource sharing and technology exchange through regional cooperation is essential for China's low-carbon transition development.

However, they are still developing and face challenges that require attention from both industry and academia. Researchers highlight the absence of a unified framework for assessing these tools, leading to simplistic binary evaluations, which result in inaccuracies in household tool evaluations.

We took the rubber wood furniture of Hainan province as the case, explored its whole life cycle GHGs from cradle-to-gate and predicted the potential GHGs from 2031 to 2062. This study is fully based on field survey and sampling data, including that of the rubber tree planting (40-year cycle) and furniture manufacturing. The results reveal: (1) Whole industry chain of rubber wood furniture emits 3.27 × 106 kgCO2-eq GHGs per 20,000 t rubber logs consuming, where the planting accounts the most (88.20%). Transport and electricity consumption are the main GHGs sources of planting and manufacturing subsystems respectively; (2) The whole life-cycle GHGs of rubber wood furniture in 2023 of Hainan is 2.07 × 107 kgCO2-eq, which mainly come from Danzhou (24.74%), Haikou (19.55%), and Qiongzhong (15.79%); (3) The total GHGs from the rubber wood furniture industry in Hainan from 2031 to 2062 are 210 MtCO2-eq and 129 MtCO2-eq respectively, without or with felling restriction. The changes of GHGs from 2051 to 2062 are caused by the regional center shift of planting gravity; (4) Improving energy use efficiency and optimizing the location of furniture factories would reduce GHGs.

This paper proposes an electric vehicle demand response (EVDR) mechanism and applies it to a nonlinear integrated energy system (IES) to address carbon emissions and energy efficiency issues. To further reduce carbon emissions, the model incorporates carbon capture technology and carbon penalty mechanisms. The model is transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem through piecewise linearization and solved using CPLEX. Experimental results show that the integrated energy scheduling model achieves load balancing through flexible EV charging scheduling, increases carbon emission costs by 1.5%, reduces total costs by 2.55%, and significantly enhances system flexibility. Additionally, the model effectively utilizes renewable energy, with zero curtailment costs for wind and photovoltaic power, reducing reliance on traditional energy sources and minimizing waste of renewable energy. The carbon capture system significantly lowers both carbon emission costs and total costs; increasing the capture rate limit by 20% can reduce total costs by 24.29%, enhancing the system’s environmental friendliness. The introduction of carbon penalty mechanisms encourages system operators to adopt more environmentally friendly production methods, promoting the transition of energy systems towards low-carbon development. The proposed scheduling model has significant theoretical and practical implications for the intelligent management of future energy systems and the progress towards carbon neutrality.

Previous studies focused more on emission inventories and abatement technologies, however, final demand also plays a significant role in driving China's industrial process-related GHG emissions. Based on the environmentally extended input-output analysis and structural path analysis, this study explores detailed industrial process-related GHG emissions inventory and investigates critical supply chain paths of 17 products and 16 types of GHG emissions. The results show that industrial process-related GHG emissions reached 1887.1 Mt CO2-eq in 2018, of which more than three-fifths was induced by fixed capital formation. The entirety of the Construction sector amounted to 54.6% of the total embodied industrial process-related GHG emissions. After examining the embodied industrial process-related GHG emissions paths, critical economic sectors such as Construction, Nonmetallic Mineral, Chemical, and the paths of “Nonmetallic Mineral → Construction → Fixed capital formation and Nonmetallic Mineral → Nonmetallic Mineral → Construction → Fixed capital formation” were identified as the main contributor.

Additionally, the increase in temperature and precipitation weakens the pollution effects of the demonstration policy. Mechanism analysis indicates that the demonstration policy can promote the development of the secondary industry and digital financial inclusion at the county level, which subsequently leads to the deterioration of local air quality. Further analysis of costs and benefits reveals that the significant positive economic effects resulting from the demonstration policy far outweigh the indirect economic losses caused by air pollution.

Given the disparate levels of development across various urban agglomerations, trade between these agglomerations may result in inequality between carbon transfers and value added transfers. Assessing carbon inequality among major urban agglomerations in China can help identify the identification of primary trade relationships and industrial sectors of carbon inequality, thereby fostering the coordinated development of urban agglomerations. This study constructs a carbon inequality index based on an environmentally extended input-output model. This study conducts a thorough evaluation of carbon inequality among various urban agglomerations and analyzes the industry characteristics of embodied carbon net transfers and value added net transfers in typical urban agglomerations. The research findings indicate that: The carbon inequality index for underdeveloped urban agglomerations, exemplified by the Central Plains urban agglomeration, is generally greater than 1. The carbon inequality index for developed urban agglomerations, exemplified by the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, is generally less than 1 due to their higher levels of economic development. An analysis of the industry characteristics of carbon emissions net transfer and value added net transfer in typical urban agglomerations reveals that heavy industry is the main contributing sector to the net inflow of embodied carbon and net outflow of value added in the Central Plains urban agglomeration. The main contributing sector to the net outflow of embodied carbon and net inflow of value added in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration is the service industry.

Using regression techniques, the average emission factor, marginal emission factor, and marginal displacement factor, are estimated for different pollutants of Guangdong, the most affluent and populous province in China. Results reveal a decline in average emission factors over the sample period of 2017–2021, owing to the expansion of renewable energy.

DfRem targets at designing products that have multiple life cycles, thus significantly reducing raw material usage, energy consumption, and carbon emissions. In this paper, we develop a three-stage framework that consists of (1) systematic design space exploration and a multi-objective optimization formulation to minimize the likelihood of failure causes (such as fatigue and wear) and environmental footprint, (2) topology optimization to further reduce material usage without significantly affecting the load-carrying capability of the product, and (3) post-topology optimization design verification to ensure the proposed design satisfies all design constraints. The environmental impact can be assessed at varying comprehensiveness levels (e.g., design and manufacturing phase, use phase) and in terms of carbon or GHG emission, energy use, and waste generation. Because the novel design framework predominantly adjusted the geometry, we focused on mass-based change and energy savings due to sustained remanufacturability. The multi-objective optimization formulation in the first step results in a Pareto optimal set of possible design solutions that the designer can use for the second step. We demonstrate the utility of this framework through a case study of an engine cylinder head subjected to thermo-mechanical loads, where we find that about 5% of the product mass can be conserved with only about a 3% increase in surface area that has a fatigue life less than 10,000 cycles.

Meanwhile, modern agricultural facilities (MAF) can play a significant role in adjusting agricultural load. Therefore, this paper proposes a negative-carbon planning method for the ARIP integrated energy system (IES). Firstly, carbon activities occurring during the operation of ARIP are sorted out and modeled based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) method, especially modeling the “zero-carbon” and “negative-carbon” benefits of biomass energy. At the same time, the models of both agricultural irrigation systems and straw bundling direct combustion heating are constructed in the ARIP planning. Then, a negative-carbon planning model for ARIP IES is established with the goal of minimizing the annualized total cost, where carbon emission reduction is integrated into the optimization objectives through carbon trading. On this basis, a two-stage distributionally robust optimization (DRO) planning model is constructed, where a box-like set and comprehensive norm constraints are used to model the seasonal differences of agricultural industry loads and the uncertainty of probability distribution in photovoltaic (PV) scenarios. Especially, a box set with adjustable uncertainty coefficients is introduced to simulate fluctuations of output in PV scenario. Finally, the CPLEX solver is used to solve the planning model. verify the effectiveness of the proposed planning method in enhancing the economic and environmental effects of ARIP. Results indicate that the proposed planning model can reduce the total cost by 49.584 × 104 $. Besides, the annual carbon emissions can be reduced from 37533.98 t CO2-eq to −15834.5 t CO2-eq.

In this technology, a multi-nozzle impinging entrained-flow gasifier is used for the first time to preheat pulverized coal (PC), and the gasified fuel enters a down-fired combustor (DFC) for complete combustion with air-staged method. A 75 kW novel self-sustained gasification-combustion test rig was constructed. The stability and feasibility of the test rig were verified, and the gasification characteristics and nitrogen migration mechanism of PC under loads of 45 kW, 55 kW, 65 kW and 75 kW were investigated. The results demonstrated that the gasifier could continuously and steadily provide high-temperature gasified gas-char mixture to the combustor. The gas-char mixture, consisting of coal gas which was rich in high-concentration flammable gases (CO, H2, and CH4) and char with enlarged specific surface area, was easy to ignite, which could enhance the flame stability of boilers operating at low loads. Additionally, more than 61.6 % of coal-N was released in the gasifier. The liberated coal-N primarily transformed to N2 and NH3 instead of NO x , while the amount of NH3 produced was influenced by the gasification temperature. The gasified gas-char mixture entering the combustor achieved stable combustion with uniform temperature distribution. Before the injection of tertiary air, the released char-N and the NH3 in coal gas transformed primarily to N2, and there was no production of NO due to the strong reducing environment. The lowest NO x emission was 122.31 mg/Nm3 (@6% O2) at 65 kW, and the combustion efficiencies under all loads exceeded 99.62%, indicating that the gasification-combustion technology could enable efficient combustion and reduce NO x emission.

However, the commercialization of RPB-based CO2 capture presents several challenges at the process level, including enhancing energy efficiency, refining equipment design, and achieving scalability. Given the mechanical constraints, designing excessively large RPB units may be impractical. Thus, the economic scalability of RPB-based CO2 capture under practical constraints remains an unresolved issue. This study explores the cost-optimal CO2 capture scale through rigorous process simulation using 30-70 wt% monoethanolamine (MEA) solvents. It optimizes the process design and operating parameters to minimize the specific CO2 avoidance costs, within the bounds of practical RPB design limitations.

However, cost-effective RPB design becomes challenging at CO2 concentrations as low as 4 mol%.

Second, both extremely high and low temperatures significantly reduce CTFP, and this negative effect is persistent, especially in poor and southern cities. Third, this negative effect comes from the decline in efficiency change rather than technology change and can also be explained by a decline in the productivity and efficiency of the desired output. Fourth, the forecasted outcomes for the future scenarios under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 1 (SSP1) and 5 (SSP5) indicate a persistent escalation in the adverse effects of extreme high temperatures.

Hydrogen, another carbon-free fuel, offers properties that complement those of ammonia and can augment its reactivity. The ammonia energy ratio (AR) and excess air coefficient (λ) wield considerable influence over performance in ammonia-hydrogen dual-fuel engines. However, a comprehensive comprehension of their mechanisms remains elusive. The experiment investigated for the first time the coupled effects of AR and λ on the combustion and emission characteristics under low-load conditions. Research indicates that elevating AR results in unstable combustion and prolongs the combustion duration. However, concurrently, it diminishes heat transfer losses and enhances brake thermal efficiency (BTE). The optimum range for the highest BTE is observed near λ = 1.4 and AR = 70% (where BTE surpasses 30.0%). In comparison with pure hydrogen, the BTE near λ = 1 (where BTE is less than 20.7%) exhibits an increase exceeding 9.3%. The lower concentration range of NOX is observed approximately between λ = 1.0–1.1 and AR = 45%–65%. Augmenting AR results in heightened emissions of unburned NH3 and N2O.

Assessing consumer vehicle selection behavior under carbon taxation ";" This research explores the dynamic relationship between the carbon tax and consumer decisions in the automotive sector, focusing on understanding the underlying drivers of vehicle choice. Followed by environmental concerns, carbon taxation has emerged as a policy lever to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we use an experimental study to elucidate whether individuals are driven by a commitment to environmental sustainability or tax optimization strategies when making vehicle selections. We use statistical methods to determine the importance of different variables in the model's predictability. Our numerical analysis exhibits significant variations among consumers' preferences and responses to increased gas prices or carbon taxation. In addition to the general statistical analysis, using the comparative methods, we demonstrate that the consumers' choices differ in two scenarios: (i) carbon taxation and (ii) a cost-equivalent increase in gas price. For example, with a 95 percent confidence level, we rejected the null hypothesis that the choice of vehicle among the consumer age group 45–54 is cost-driven and independent of a cost-equivalent increase in gas price. Our findings provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of carbon taxes in promoting sustainable transportation decisions. In conclusion, this study shows that implementing carbon tax regimes influences customers beyond the dollar value of driving a car, suggesting the presence of unobservable factors such as personal preferences toward environmentally friendly policies. Furthermore, our research identifies several classes of individuals that differ in their responses to carbon tax, highlighting the need for policymakers to consider demographic and socioeconomic factors when designing and implementing such policies.

Cocoa pod husks (CPH) are a major farm waste representing considerable export of nutrients from cocoa soils, particularly P and K. Here, the impacts of soil amendment with raw CPH residues, CPH compost, CPH biochar, or a CPH compost-biochar mixture on soil fertility, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and nutrient losses via leaching were assessed in two laboratory experiments using two major soil types used for cocoa cultivation in Ghana (an acidic Ferralsol and an alkaline Nitisol). In Experiment 1, soil nutrient availability and CO2 and N2O emissions were quantified, whereas simulation and quantification of nutrient leaching were conducted in Experiment 2. Soil pH increased from 4.8 and 8.6 by 1.4- and 1.1-folds on average in amended Ferralsols and Nitisols, respectively. Soil electrical conductivity increased in soils amended with CPH compost and/or biochar. Addition of raw CPH caused remarkable microbial immobilisation of N and reduced N availability and leaching, whereas CPH compost and/or biochar addition increased soil nitrate availability but reduced soil ammonium availability. Leaching of Ca in Nitisols was reduced when CPH biochar was included in the soil amendment. While soil K availability increased in all amended soils, most notably when CPH biochar was included, soil P and Ca availabilities were greatest where CPH compost was included. Soil total GHG emission (CO2 plus N2O) increased in all amended Ferralsols and the Nitisols amended with CPH compost or raw CPH, with the latter remarkably increasing soil CO2 emission by up to 14.8-folds. Compared to sole CPH compost amendment, CPH compost-biochar mixture amendment reduced soil total GHG emission and N and P leaching. These findings show that composted and/or pyrolysed CPH can be judiciously used to enhance soil fertility in cocoa farms, particularly in acidic soils. Pyrolysed CPH is especially beneficial for reducing soil nutrient leaching and GHG emissions and thus for increasing the sustainability of cocoa production in Ghana and west Africa.";"2024-11-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624035145";"3";"Emissions"
"10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.144070";"Investigation on the methane emissions from permeation of urban gas polyethylene pipes under the background of hydrogen-mixed natural gas transportation ";" Methane, a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, aggravates the greenhouse effect of ecological environment through its emissions. When transporting hydrogen-mixed natural gas through urban polyethylene pipes, methane will be emitted due to the permeation characteristic of polyethylene pipe material. Therefore, it is crucial to pay attention to the methane emissions from permeation of polyethylene pipes for protecting the environment and climate. In this paper, the solubility and diffusion coefficients of methane within hydrogen-mixed natural gas in polyethylene pipe materials are calculated through the Monte Carlo method and molecular dynamics simulation to determine the permeation coefficient of methane. Simultaneously, the methane emissions and equivalent carbon dioxide emissions of the hydrogen-mixed natural gas in polyethylene pipes are investigated. Results indicate the methane solubility coefficient decreases with increasing temperature and hydrogen mixing ratio. The methane diffusion and permeation coefficients increase with the rising temperature and pressure, and decreasing hydrogen mixing ratio. The pressure exerts minor influence while the temperature and hydrogen mixing ratio have more significant impact. That is, the lower the temperature and the higher the hydrogen mixing ratio, the less methane emissions caused by permeation. Therefore, the effective reduction of methane emissions can be achieved by adding the insulation layer to mitigate the impact of high temperature and increasing the hydrogen mixing ratio. For example, for the polyethylene pipe with the operating pressure of 4 bar and the size specification of SDR11, when the temperature drops from 300 K to 260 K, the methane emissions of hydrogen-mixed natural gas with hydrogen mixing ratios of 0 vol%, 20 vol%, 50 vol% and 80 vol% will be drastically reduced by 73.3%, 74.4%, 77.2% and 78.5% respectively, and when 20 vol%∼80 vol% hydrogen are mixed in the natural gas at 260 K, 300 K and 310 K, the methane emissions will be effectively reduced by 26.7%–85.6%, 23.3%–82.1% and 23.9%–82.4% respectively. The findings of this study can serve as guidance for reducing the methane emissions from permeation of polyethylene pipes transporting hydrogen-mixed natural gas.

However, the carbon-saving potential of urban blue-green space at the urban scale needs to be addressed in the literature. In this study, an improved ideal quantitative model of carbon-saving is constructed from the user's perspective, considering the cooling effects of urban blue-green space and integrating surface temperature, building information, and urban public space layout. A high-density urban area in a northern cold region of China (Tianjin center urban area) is taken as an example to estimate the annual carbon-saving by performing Landsat surface temperature inversions with the delineation of the effective cooling area, as well as regression analyses based on four seasons of data. The results show that the annual carbon-saving in 2021 is about 78 tonneC/km2, equivalent to 2.21 times the carbon sequestration of the same region. Compared with the edge of the center urban area, the urban blue-green space in the center has a carbon-saving with a 1.4 times higher fluctuation value and a cumulative annual difference of about 394 tonneC/km2. Large blue-green patches in the cold region, while capable of conserving more carbon in spring, summer, and fall, become carbon-source in winter due to increased heating energy consumption and reduced willingness of residents to adopt zero-carbon transportation. The indicators that have the most significant impact on the carbon-saving of urban blue-green space are the cooling area and the background surface temperature. The urban blue-green space coverage and the percentage of impervious surfaces, such as buildings and open spaces, will indirectly impact carbon-saving by affecting the cooling area. The above finding recognizes the carbon-saving potential of urban blue-green space in cold regions. It provides a feasible estimation scheme for comparing the carbon-saving capacity in different seasons.

It is argued that a framing lens helps to advance understanding of this challenge by surfacing situated and heterogeneous perspectives on systems change. Frames are knowledge structures and default assumptions that help to guide action. This paper examines the frames of ‘systems change’ in purposeful sustainability transformations. To this end, a meta-synthesis of 155 case studies of sociotechnical systems change for sustainability and circular economy was conducted. Inductively coding these cases and comparing the emergent themes, four frames of systems change for sustainability were identified, varying depending on what they deem feasible and desirable change, the mechanisms and processes of change-making, and the different actor roles in these pursuits. A process model is developed to explain how explicit attention to frames can support opening up the directionality of purposeful systems transformations in ways that inform the design and implementation of more plural policy mixes. This contributes to the literature on directionality by providing insights on the boundaries of frames for systems change and the policy mix literature by identifying ways to engage directly with key assumptions guiding change-making efforts.";"2024-11-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624034255";"1";"Emissions"

In fact, according to a European report concerning existing buildings, 80% of the built environment will remain the same by 2050. Nowadays buildings are responsible for 30% of the global final energy consumption and 37% of global energy and process emissions. As regards industrial buildings, they account for 33% of global final energy demand. The research aims to define some effective retrofitting measures to be applied in the existing Italian industrial facilities to improve their both energy and environmental performance. Several redevelopment scenarios and their possible combinations related to external envelope technological solutions and systems are analysed. The different interventions are applied to an existing Italian industrial building chosen as a case study and are compared by Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) analysis considering different environmental indexes (GWP, AP, PERT and PENRT). The calculation of the primary energy demand is also performed. Phase B6 accounts for about 80% of the whole environmental impact calculated considering 20 years as building lifetime. The redevelopment scenarios that foresee the intervention on the external envelope are the most impactful ones in terms of the production phase (A1-A3). Those related to the existing roof are characterised by a significant impact due to the demolition, disposal and landfill of finishing panels made of asbestos. The configurations that include the substitution of the existing heating system with an air-to-air heat pump coupled with renewables to produce electrical energy on-site are the most advantageous ones.

Solvent-based carbon capture has emerged as a leading technology for SBCC, primarily due to its low retrofit costs and effectiveness in treating flue gas with low carbon content. However, challenges remain in optimizing system operation efficiency under the variable conditions of ship main engine loads and in understanding the mechanisms by which process parameters influence key evaluation factors. Consequently, this study established a pilot-scale experimental platform for solvent-based SBCC and developed a carbon capture model based on it. The influence of process parameters, such as main engine exhaust flow rate and liquid/gas ratio (L/G), on the evaluation factors was thoroughly explored. With the utilization of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis to quantify the influence of process parameters on the evaluation factors, a multi-objective optimization equation is proposed. The combination of machine learning and optimization algorithms offers an efficient approach for determining the optimal process of the SBCC system under different main engine loads.

This study addresses the challenge of balancing environmental and economic objectives within the constraints of pollution control and carbon peak targets. The primary aim was to estimate the synergistic effects of reducing pollutants and carbon emissions while understanding the nonlinear responses of air quality to these reductions. To achieve this, a nonlinear optimization model was developed to minimize economic costs while optimizing mobile source pollutant and carbon reduction. Key findings include that upgrading emission standards significantly reduces pollutants, but does not impact CO2 levels directly. Conversely, electrification nearly eliminates pollutants from vehicles and achieves an 18.3% reduction in CO2 emissions from a lifecycle perspective. The study quantifies the substantial contribution of mobile sources to PM2.5 (30.1%–50.6%) and O3 (42.9%–52.5%), with regional variations showing even higher local contributions. The optimized control scheme is projected to limit CO2 emissions increase to less than 1.75% by 2030, while reducing PM2.5 and O3 concentrations by 46%–61% and 21%–68%, respectively.

The influence of process parameters, such as main engine exhaust flow rate and liquid/gas ratio (L/G), on the evaluation factors was thoroughly explored. With the utilization of Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis to quantify the influence of process parameters on the evaluation factors, a multi-objective optimization equation is proposed. The combination of machine learning and optimization algorithms offers an efficient approach for determining the optimal process of the SBCC system under different main engine loads. The research results show that the main engine exhaust flow rate is the most important process parameter affecting the carbon capture rate (CR), with an influence ratio as high as 64.33%. As the main engine exhaust flow rate increases, the maximum CR decreases from 97.84% to 61.13%. Although the extreme value of the regeneration energy consumption (REC) also decreases from 6.66 to 4.42 GJ/t CO2, the solvent flow rate's influence on REC is also significant, with influence ratios of 38.49% and 35.53%, respectively. A data-driven approach examined the optimal operating conditions at eight main engine loads, achieving a carbon capture rate prediction error of only 1.42% and a maximum REC error of only 0.55 GJ/t CO2. This study provides essential guidance for assessing the suitability of SBCC systems. ";"2024-11-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624034450";"6";"Emissions"
"10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.143963";"Surrogate-model-based low-carbon optimization method for tolerance allocation of mechanical components under bidirectional constraints ";" The low-carbon optimization of tolerance allocation involves reducing production costs and carbon emissions, while ensuring dimensional precision, making it a crucial pathway to achieving low-carbon manufacturing. However, the complex mapping mechanism between tolerance, cost, and carbon emissions makes it challenging to construct effective mechanistic models. This complexity arises from both the forward constraints of multiple-coupled design features of components and backward constraints on the differentiated processing conditions of an enterprise. Therefore, a low-carbon optimization method for tolerance allocation based on surrogate models is proposed. Firstly, the RReliefF algorithm is utilized to analyze the influence of design features and enterprise processing condition factors on the low-carbon performance of tolerance allocation, identifying key influencing factors. Secondly, a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based surrogate model is established to predict the low-carbon performance of tolerance allocation. Specifically, datasets of tolerance, manufacturing costs, and carbon emissions under different design feature constraints are constructed. To improve the training efficiency and accuracy of the prediction model, the heterogeneous data of design features are processed using the one-hot encoding technique. Subsequently, the mapping relationship between tolerance, cost, and carbon emissions is established based on the CNN. Finally, with the aim of minimizing costs and carbon emissions, a low-carbon optimization method for tolerance allocation is established based on the surrogate model and the product size chain. The convolutional neural network-Harris Hawk optimization algorithm (CNN-HHO) is utilized to generate tolerance allocation schemes that minimize both cost and carbon emissions while satisfying dimensional precision. Through a series of multi-peak test functions and practical case studies of the overrunning clutch, the results indicate that the proposed CNN-HHO algorithm demonstrates exceptional accuracy and stability in the validation on the test functions. Furthermore, the optimized overrunning clutch solution achieves approximately 2.61% cost reduction and 2.63% decrease in carbon emissions, providing further support for the effectiveness of the proposed method.

This study investigates how cap-and-trade regulations affect the performance of a dual-channel green supply chain amidst disruptions. It explores the interplay between pricing and greening strategies under cap-and-trade conditions and varying market demand disruptions. The model features a Stackelberg game between a manufacturer of eco-friendly products and a retailer, applied to both centralized and decentralized systems. Findings reveal that cap-and-trade regulations affect centralized and decentralized supply chains differently. Centralized systems show higher sensitivity in greenness levels to disruptions compared to decentralized ones. Lower greening cost coefficients lead to higher greenness levels in both models, but centralized systems outperform decentralized ones when cap-and-trade regulations are absent. However, the performance of centralized systems deteriorates significantly during severe disruptions, whereas decentralized systems maintain profitability growth. Additionally, the study finds that increased greening costs reduce the optimal greenness level, impacting wholesale and sale prices. Centralized supply chains exhibit greater variability in carbon emissions and profits under disruption conditions, while decentralized systems show more stability and higher profitability, particularly in severe disruptions. The findings also indicate that a dynamic cap-and-trade system can enhance adaptability and efficiency in managing emissions during disruptions.

Results revealed eight major categories covering institutional setting and power struggle; the wider economic context; incumbent energy fossil fuels companies – repositioning; emerging green energy actors – positioning; geopolitics; heating and energy distribution; corporate social responsibility; energy market liberalisation, and a residual category related to press verbosity. Through these results we contributed to a finely-grained identification of specific themes on Romanian energy, added insights on how hesitancy is enacted through delays, circumventing the rules, establishing non-compliance, and denials. Our approach showed that the power transmitted by various actors through the media was politically marked and incongruent to the holistic paradigm that energy transition should embrace.

Evidence from a debiased machine learning model ";" Reducing carbon emissions to improve environmental quality has been the Chinese government's unwavering dedication in recent years. Several policies have been implemented with the objective of driving carbon reduction. The implementation of the outgoing leadership natural resources audit policy has played a pivotal role in encouraging local government officials to prioritize both economic and environmental development in their pursuit of performance metrics. However, whether the implementation of this policy contributes to an enhancement in carbon emission efficiency requires further empirical validation. This study, utilizing panel data from 282 cities across China, explores the potential impact of the audit policy (specifically referring to the outgoing leadership natural resources asset audit policy, without ambiguity) on carbon emission efficiency through the application of a debiased machine learning model. The results of the study show that the audit policy has been crucial in greatly raising the regional level of carbon emission efficiency. Furthermore, mechanistic analysis results suggest that the audit policy can enhance regional carbon emission efficiency by influencing green innovation and raising government environmental awareness and green financial levels. Based on the heterogeneity analysis, the regions east of the Hu Line, cities with low levels of corruption, less stringent economic growth objectives, and areas with high levels of public environmental concern are the areas where auditing rules have the greatest influence on carbon emission efficiency.

Based on this theoretical foundation and literature motivation this study addresses the impact of government investments on carbon emissions, in the case of 38 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries.

The complexity and interconnection of the global challenges are, however, difficult to interpret at the local level. This requires enhanced collaboration and coordination together with a shared understanding of the interconnected nature of our energy systems and the strategies that shape them. Global, international, and national strategies for carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) have emerged in recent years as carbon is increasingly outlined as a key element in the future energy system. This emphasizes CCUS strategies as an important part of a transition toward a fully decarbonized society. Therefore, principal strategies for CCUS and the energy system need to be coordinated and translated following a spatiotemporal assessment to enable meaningful actions at the local level. This article applies a regional perspective, in which a regional energy system model seeks to bridge the gap between national and local energy planning. The regional energy system is developed as part of an overarching national scenario for the transition towards a fully decarbonized society. This context provides a national boundary shaped by a global ceiling to provide a meaningful and adequate framework for regional and local development in the future. The overarching national scenario frames the potentials and constraints of the regional energy system and CCUS strategies as part of a global transition while enabling investigations of potential ramifications from changes in national objectives. The analysis in the article uses the North Denmark Region as a case and investigates scenarios in which the region assumes various roles as a contributor to the national transition. The results indicate a need for more interactive and dynamic energy planning and CCUS strategies to comprehend possible impacts from the various roles and changes in the national objectives.

An illustrative study of a bottom-up neighbourhood initiative shows how specific meanings and values (expressed, for example, through meanings of “enough”) affect several social practices from different consumption categories (nutrition, daily mobility, travelling). Environmental assessments further show that changing social practices across consumption categories can substantially decrease environmental pressures from private household consumption, especially in the field of nutrition.

Assessing the health risks for different populations around these coking enterprises nationwide is challenging due to the lack of clarity regarding SO2 concentrations at varying distances from these facilities. To address this issue, we developed a buffer Latin hypercube XGBoost particle swarm optimization (BLH-XGB-PSO) algorithm that combines efficient global search capabilities and accurate prediction performance. This algorithm enables effective traversal of monitoring points located at varying distances and directions around the enterprise while automatically seeking optimal model parameters. Using this model, we accurately predicted the concentration of SO2 every 0.5 km within a 10 km radius around China's coking enterprises in 2017, achieving a high prediction accuracy with an R2 value of 0.97. The prediction results indicate that the highest concentration of SO2 in the vicinity of Chinese coking enterprises is observed in the central region of Shanxi province (65.88 μg/m3). The average annual concentration of SO2 around all production enterprises amounts to 27.9 μg/m3. Furthermore, we conducted an assessment on the impact of coking enterprises on different age groups, genders, and regions regarding the number of affected individuals, health exposure risks, and control effectiveness.

Although these internal (i.e., originating from the business) signals are generally considered suboptimal, does their influence depend on how customers weigh them against external (i.e., originating from other sources) signals about the past performance of the business? Our research examines the separate and combined impact of self-declared sustainability claims (i.e., internal signal) and aggregated performance ratings (i.e., external signal) on customers. A scenario-based experiment showed that both self-declared sustainability claims and performance ratings independently increase customers’ intention to visit a hotel or restaurant. However, we found no evidence for an interaction effect – i.e., the combination of the two signals appears to have no effect on customers. To gain a deeper understanding, we conducted a qualitative study, which revealed mixed and paradoxical perceptions among customers. While the two signals are perceived to be distinct (communicating different attributes) and even dissonant (communicating opposing attributes), they are also perceived to mutually influence one another in that a high (vs. low) performance rating reflects positively on a self-declared sustainability claim, and vice versa. Subsequently, we discuss managerial strategies for communicating sustainability credentials vis-à-vis the overall performance of the business.

There is therefore growth potential for electric mobility and photovoltaic technology. In this context, this study explores the integration of electric vehicles into the Portuguese car fleet using photovoltaic solar energy for battery charging, with the aim of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and reducing dependence on fossil fuels for mobility. A multi-phase approach was adopted: i) a sample of electric vehicles representative of the Portuguese car fleet and their energy needs was sized; ii) the equipment to be incorporated into the Self-Consumption Production Units was selected and sized, using PVsyst software version 7.3.4, and based on the energy needs resulting from three scenarios of weekly use of the electric vehicle [50 km (scenario 1), 300 km (scenario 2) and 750 km (scenario 3)]; iii) the reductions in GHG emissions were quantified by analysing: emissions from the Public Service Electricity Grid (RESP) and the Photovoltaic Integration System for Self-Consumption and Grid (SIFAR), and also emissions associated with the fossil fuels under analysis (petrol and diesel). In scenario 1, the difference was 57.5%. In scenario 2, it was −24.3%, and in scenario 3, it was −55.9%. These results demonstrate that SIFAR is an attractive and more sustainable alternative to RESP in the most energy-demanding scenarios, in this case, scenarios 2 and 3. By contributing to a considerable reduction in GHG emissions into the atmosphere, SIFAR stands out for its role in building sustainability. Presenting a new methodological perspective and vision on the integration of renewable energies in the transport sector in Portugal, this study closes a knowledge gap and provides relevant information for planning and public policy.";"2024-10-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624032839";"3";"Emissions"

However, economic output as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is increasingly being seen as an unreliable and undesirable economic indicator and policy goal. Instead, multiple indicators of environmental impacts and social outcomes are needed to make decisions about sustainable development. Drawing on the Doughnut of social and planetary boundaries, and the Sustainable Development Goals, we analyse 50 models to assess the state of the art in modelling the environment, society, and economy. We categorise models according to their economic foundation and modelling approach, assess their coverage of 15 environmental and 21 social indicators, and identify feedbacks between different model parts. We further construct a targeted sample of 15 models that represents the diversity in modelling approaches and indicator coverage, and use this sample to investigate how environmental and social indicators are linked to macroeconomic drivers. For the environment, indicator coverage is best for climate change, energy use, and land conversion. Within current models, environmental impact is largely driven by GDP and agricultural production. For society, coverage is best for jobs, income (wages and inequality), and productivity. Within current models, social outcomes are largely driven by income per capita, government spending, and governance. Models rarely contain feedbacks from the environment and society to the economy, and few include any biophysical limits. The current focus on monetary flows limits understanding of the interconnections between environmental, social, and economic systems. We argue that modellers should rely less on economic variables as determinants of social and environmental outcomes. Specific provisioning systems could be modelled in more detail to allow models to explore growth-agnostic ways of achieving a good life for all within environmental limits.";"2024-10-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624032268";"6";"Emissions"

CO2 capture using alkaline solutions and absorbent regeneration mediated through bipolar membrane electrodialysis (BMED) have been tested previously as a standalone technology. However, the continuous operation of an integrated system remains largely unclear. Here, a bench-scale study was conducted using an integrated prototype to analyze the performance of CO2 capture and electrochemical regeneration using potassium hydroxide (KOH) aqueous solution. A wide range of current densities from 150 to 1000 A/m2 was applied to demonstrate the continuous operation of the CO2 capture system emphasizing the stability in attainable high rich carbon loading and CO2 desorption. The electrochemical regeneration module achieved CO2 desorption efficiency of 70% and absorbent recovery up to 89% under industrial relevant current densities of 500–1000 A/m2. The absorbent recovery has been identified to be a result of the combined effect of load ratio and rich carbon loading. The observed inefficient CO2 separation indicates significant potential to enhance energy efficiency.

Extensive cross-national analyses on this topic can inform the global agenda; however, far fewer subnational explorations consider the impact of urbanization in moderating the relationships between energy resource use, greenhouse gas emissions, socio-economic and human development. Therefore, this research analyzed Chinese subnational data from 2000 to 2019 to reveal the dynamic relationship between energy use and objective human well-being and explored how urbanization moderated the transitional linkages from energy use to economic development to human need satisfiers and to human well-being. This research found a diminishing return from energy use (both primary energy extraction and final energy use) to the Human Development Index (HDI) from 2000 to 2019. Moreover, in later years, there was neither a linear correlation nor a log-linear relationship between energy use and HDI at the subnational level. In contrast, HDI was consistently strongly correlated with GDP per capita and household income at the subnational level in China over time. Two distinct energy-GDP pathways, i.e., high energy use-low GDP and low energy use-high GDP, were observed at the subnational level, which explained why the log-linear relationship between HDI and energy use/GHGs diminished over time. Urbanization level had a significant moderating impact on the linkages between human need satisfiers and HDI, as well as life expectancy.

This study aims to assess and compare the effectiveness of these two types of policies in reducing carbon emissions, identify factors that enhance their effectiveness, and provide practical policy recommendations. We perform a meta-analysis based on 81 studies published between 2011 and 2022, evaluating the impact of carbon taxes and ETSs on carbon emissions. Data for each study were manually collected, resulting in a sample of 2032 estimation results. We use four measures —a discrete measure categorizing effects as negative, positive, or non-significant and three continuous measures (one-tail p-value, overall correlation, and Fisher's z-score)—to quantify the effects and provide detailed information on the significance, direction, and magnitude of the relationship. The results show that both carbon taxes and ETSs reduce carbon emissions but that the effect of the carbon taxes is stronger than that of ETSs. These findings are consistent across all models and samples used in the studies. The results of the heterogeneity analysis of the effects of these policies suggest that country-level characteristics, such as financial development and GDP growth rates, can affect the effectiveness of both carbon taxes and ETSs. The reduction effect of carbon taxes is strongest in Asia (excluding Japan), while that of ETSs is strongest in the United States. Finally, carbon taxes and ETSs are particularly effective in reducing carbon emissions from carbon dioxide-intensive industries and fossil fuels. Carbon-pricing policies are therefore effective tools for reducing carbon emissions, though country and industry-specific factors can influence the effectiveness of these policies. Careful consideration of implementation strategies, economic structures, political commitment, technological advancements, and alternative energy sources is necessary to ensure the long-term effectiveness and sustainability of carbon-pricing policies. Overall, this study highlights the potential of carbon-pricing policies to address the environmental challenges associated with climate change and facilitate the achievement of carbon neutrality.

In this research, a three-layer broiler chicken meat production supply model is developed with greenhouse gas emissions reduction and an eco-friendly meat production system. The green technology investments and carbon tax policy are implemented to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from broiler chicken farmers and processors. The optimal cycle time, green investment, and number of shipments in the proposed model are computed in the Mathematica 9.0 software flatform by using the solution-finding algorithm. The concavity of the objective function is verified through two methods: mathematically, using the Hessian matrix concavity test, and graphically, by three-dimensional plotting of the objective function. The numerical examples, optimal solution table, results discussion, sensitivity analysis, and managerial implications are presented for the broiler chicken meat-producing industry.

Its environmental impact has also increased, with shipping packaging being a key contributor. The sector is, however, struggling to tackle this environmental impact, as well as to follow new packaging regulations. Previous studies on reusable packaging have predominantly been qualitative or concentrated on material selection, overlooking essential elements of supply chain design and consumer behaviour. Industry reports attempting to quantify the sustainability of reusable packaging have produced varied results that lack generalisability or transferability to other contexts. Consequently, it is difficult to determine the actual environmental sustainability of reusable packaging in e-commerce. In this research, we assess the carbon footprint of reusable packaging in e-commerce, through a comparison of eight case studies. A multiple case study approach is followed, employing an embedded design where more than one unit of analysis is explored in each case. We evaluate the CO2 emissions of all processes related to the circular supply chain of reusable packaging employing a method that can evaluate different solutions and situations and a sensitivity analysis. Findings highlight three specific factors influencing the carbon footprint of reusable packaging: (1) reusable packaging material, (2) return and reuse rate, and (3) supply chain design (i.e., centralised versus decentralised design, travel distance, transport mode). For the same type of reusable packaging, we found that polyester generates 215% more CO2 emissions than cardboard in production and waste management. However, by analysing the same reusable packaging and supply chain, these same emissions can drastically increase if the return and reuse rate decreases. Changes in the return and reuse rate mainly linked, among others, to customer behaviour and involvement. Furthermore, for the same reusable packaging and return and reuse rate, a decentralised supply chain can reduce the CO2 emissions compared to a centralised structure. Interestingly, reusable packaging is environmentally sustainable long before it reaches its maximum life cycle.

We find that the iron & steel, cement, and chemical industry segments contribute about 70% of the sector's GHG mitigation efforts to align with 2050 carbon neutrality. Key decarbonization options include electrification of industrial processes, utilization of hydrogen and bioenergy, and adoption of carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies, although the relative significance of these options varies across the segments. We also demonstrate the dependency of sectoral decarbonization pathways on the availability of CCS and hydrogen technologies, as well as their influence on the development of upstream energy infrastructures, such as electricity and hydrogen production. Our results indicate that limited CCS deployment would necessitate a faster phase-out of fossil fuel-based industrial technologies and quicker decarbonization of the electricity and hydrogen production sectors. Conversely, constrained hydrogen deployment would increase reliance on CCS, placing a greater emission reduction burden on other sectors like electricity generation and buildings. Within the industry sector, limited CCS utilization would force the chemical segment to achieve disproportionately larger negative emissions compared to the constrained hydrogen deployment scenario, as the latter allows for wider adoption of CCS, particularly in the iron & steel segment. Overall, the study emphasizes the need for rapid and extensive transformation of the three key industrial segments to achieve Korea's 2050 carbon neutrality target, with CCS technologies and, to a lesser extent, hydrogen technologies playing a significant role in shaping the industry's decarbonization pathways and the nation's energy systems.

Therefore, based on 15,603 Chinese RE policy documents from 1975 to 2022, this study employs text mining, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), Policy Modeling Consistency-Text Encoder (PMC-TE), and System-Generalized Method of Moments (SYS-GMM). It assesses the policy input intensity (PII) for different energy types, regions, and time periods, while also investigating the impact of PII about RE on carbon emissions. The study findings are as follows: (1)The PII is not uniform, with hydropower having the highest PII at 80,591, followed by solar (25,839) and biomass energy (18,903). The PII of wind (11,377) and geothermal energy (11,340) is similar, while hydrogen energy exhibits the weakest PII at 3488. (2)There are regional disparities in PII, with solar and wind energy being most prominent in northern regions, solar and hydropower being most significant in eastern regions, and wind and biomass energy aligning with local resources in southern regions. (3)RE policies have driven China's energy transition through four distinct phases. (4)Policy effectiveness varies, with solar, wind, and hydropower policies having the most significant impact on carbon emissions reduction, followed by biomass and geothermal energy. (5)China's government role in the RE strategy has shifted from a dominant role to a regulatory one.

In this study, we propose a framework based on the spatiotemporal recurrent neural network (PredRNN) to efficiently generate accurate 3-h and 6-km PM2.5 maps with a lead time of 5 days. In this framework, two PredRNN networks are initially utilized to forecast PM2.5 concentration at ground monitoring sites and the spatial distribution of aerosol optical depth (AOD) by assimilating the output of numerical prediction model. Subsequently, the 3-h and 6-km PM2.5 forecasted maps with a lead time of 5 days can be inferred by establishing the regression links between the forecasted results of PM2.5 concentration at ground sites and AOD maps. We evaluate the proposed framework in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration region during 2017–2020. Compared with the numerical prediction products of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service, the proposed framework achieves higher accuracy, with R2 of 0.83 at the forecast base time and 0.70 at the fifth day. The spatial information richness is also enhanced by approximately 15.67% according to the information entropy metrics. Notably, the proposed framework only requires 1 min for forecasting 5-days PM2.5 maps. These results demonstrate that our framework can efficiently generate accurate and fine PM2.5 maps with a lead time of 5 days.

Global demand for aluminum has grown rapidly since 1970 and has shown a high correlation with population and economic growth. These factors have posed challenges to carbon reduction of aluminum industry. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate global aluminum demand and emissions to develop low carbon pathways. However, few studies have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the global aluminum industry. We develop different scenarios of joint abatement measures to explore pathways for the aluminum industry to significantly reduce carbon emissions by 2050. Three scenarios are considered, namely, moderate mitigation scenario (MMS), enhanced mitigation scenario (EMS), and deep mitigation scenario (DMS). The results show that: 1) Aluminum industry has a high potential for carbon emission reduction. The emissions in the three scenarios will be reduced by 33%, 77% and 85% by 2050 compared to 2020, respectively. 2) The carbon emission reduction effect of energy structure optimization and low carbon technology application is significant, with the use of clean energy playing a decisive role. 3) There is an inverse U-shaped curve relationship between per capita primary aluminum demand and per capita GDP. The aluminum demand in China and India is still growing at a high rate, and carbon emissions are always at the top.

Unfortunately, only scarce and partial medicine life cycle assessments (LCAs) are reported due to the limited availability of needed data to perform them. Methods We describe a method to estimate the cradle-to-pharmacy gate LCA of all oral medicines from the French pharmacopeia (n = 12,316 medicines) that includes the entire medicine-related carbon footprint, encompassing active pharmaceutical ingredient (API), excipients and packaging production, transport, medicine manufacturing, and associated corporate emissions using a hybrid LCA/environmentally extended input-output model. The uncertainty surrounding this estimation is modeled using bootstrap. Findings Although the API carbon footprint is correlated with synthesis yield, its number of steps, presence of chiral center(s), and process mass intensity, the API carbon footprint is better predicted by its wholesale cost. Corporate emissions (34.5%), API production (28.5%), and medicine manufacturing (25.5%) are the most impactful contributors to medicine carbon footprints, while medicine packaging (5.3%), transport (3.6%), and excipients (2.7%) are less significant. Variations from one medicine to another are substantial. The mean carbon footprint of a medicine box is 8.47 kgCO2eq/box (median 1.46 kgCO2eq, 95% CI 0.34–73.98). Medicines' carbon footprint is correlated with their price but not linearly, as low-cost medicines have significantly higher emission factors of 0.2–0.3 kgCO2/€ versus 0.05–0.1 kgCO2/€ for high-cost drugs. Orphan and innovative medicines tend to have higher carbon footprints. Interpretation Medicine carbon footprints are highly variable.

This study explores how automotive industry agglomeration impacts CO2 emissions across 278 Chinese cities, and uncover the impact patterns based on varying city characteristics. The results show that the technology agglomeration of the automobile industry exhibits a nonlinear “U-shaped” impact on CO2 emissions with a threshold value of 0.4267, while the scale agglomeration shows a nonlinear inverted “U-shaped” impact with a threshold value of 0.1206. In low-carbon demonstration cities, technology agglomeration has the most significant impact, with fluctuations ranging from −14.65% to 16.12%. In contrast, transitional cities are most affected by scale agglomeration, with a fluctuation range of −18.1%–11.19%. Besides, the results indicate that China's automobile industry development programs tend to relocate economic activities from highly agglomerated low-carbon demonstration cities to potential development cities with lower levels of agglomeration and other transitioning cities.

Despite extensive discussions on macro abatement options, facility-specific mitigation potentials and decarbonization strategies remain unclear, which cumulatively affects the progress towards global 1.5 °C and 2 °C warming control targets. This study develops a carbon footprint inventory of 163 primary aluminum smelters in 2022 and analyzes current emission structures concerning location, age, production, and input-output. Then adjust available technologies and efficiencies to match global plant-level decarbonization routes. The potential contributions of each strategy are finally quantified, accounting for significant geographic variations in emissions, thereby supplementing tailored technology transformation pathways for smelters across nine focus regions. The results show that: (1) Young smelters, predominantly in developing regions, are crucial for abatement. Rapid retrofits ahead could save CO2 budgets by 0.6–28.56 Gt, potentially delaying excess emissions under climate targets, particularly with comprehensive retrofits. (2) The paramount technical retrofitting for carbon neutrality differs regionally and evolves. Smelters in developing countries should prioritize renewable energy investment in the immediate future, succeeded by the optimization of power generation infrastructures. To liberate more emission allowances, developed countries ought to contemplate the decommissioning of aged smelters or upgrading through emerging supply-side technologies.

Predicting future trends in PM2.5 concentrations is crucial for preventing air pollution hazards to human health. However, current machine learning-based forecasting models often focus on specific regions or sites, resulting in poor spatial generalization performance. To address this issue, this study utilizes ERA5 meteorological reanalysis data, MERRA2 assimilated aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, and ground pollutant monitoring site data to construct a three-dimensional dataset. A novel hybrid deep neural network model (D_GAT) is proposed to simultaneously forecast the future 72h PM2.5 concentration trends for all sites in China. The D_GAT model combines the advantages of a graph attention network and a long short-term memory neural network, which can effectively aggregate spatial information between sites and simulate the spatial transport process and time series change characteristics of pollutant particles. Moreover, the proposed calculation method for attention scores quantified based on the actual pollutant propagation characteristics, combined with the upper atmosphere pollution transport process represented by AOD, can better express the pollution contributions of different neighboring sites to the predicted central site. Experimental results show that, compared to four other baseline models, the novel model achieves an average R2 of 0.732 for all sites in 72-h prediction, which is the highest among the five models, and the prediction accuracy of 72h is also in the forefront compared with the current similar research.

Coupling the production process can provide economic and environmental benefits when implementing breakthrough technologies in these industries. The advantages and application potential of the co-production system need to be assessed quantitatively in long-term decarbonization pathways. This study proposes a co-production system of cement and methanol that capitalizes on strong complementarity through bidirectional material flow. Multi-regional planning models are established to evaluate the spatiotemporal deployment of low-carbon technologies, including coupling technologies. The results demonstrate that the co-production system can achieve a 6.6% higher emissions reduction and a 21.2 % lower production cost of clinker by 2060 compared to implementing breakthrough technologies separately. The co-production routes may be widely distributed across China by 2060, accounting for 24.1 % of clinker output and 54.7 % of methanol output. Introducing coupling technologies can influence the industrial layout and trade patterns of China's cement and methanol sectors, carrying policy implications for the deployment of low-carbon technologies.

This study employs the Global Change Analysis Model to develop a provincial-differentiated control strategy (EQU scenario) that not only aims to meet the national carbon neutrality goal but also enhances population health and environmental equity. The EQU scenario forecasts substantial reductions in average population weighted PM2.5 and O3 concentrations to 7 μg/m3 and 34 ppb, respectively, by 2060. In comparison to a baseline scenario (NEU), the EQU scenario offers more equitable air quality improvements and significant health benefits, potentially preventing 39 thousand PM2.5-related and 10 thousand O3-related premature deaths, with minimal additional cost. The Gini coefficient, indicating CO2 emission distribution inequality among provinces, is projected to decrease from 0.58 in NEU to 0.37 in EQU. This scenario anticipates about one-third of provinces achieving carbon neutrality by 2060, with a harmonized provincial carbon neutrality capacity. The study highlights the critical importance of integrating provincially differentiated controls within national decarbonization strategies, advancing equitable deep decarbonization and reinforcing environmental justice in China.

Consequently, effective policy incentives are essential for catalyzing its growth. As a critical incentivization policy within the dual-carbon strategic objectives, carbon emissions trading can provide crucial support for the investment and operation of CCUS projects. This study aims to identify optimal flows of CO2 and allocation of carbon allowance, integrating carbon tax and carbon emissions trading policies, while minimizing the regional emission reduction costs. Coal-fired power plants are taken as carbon capture objects, enhanced coal bed methane reservoirs, enhanced oil recovery formations, deep saline aquifers and depleted gas fields are taken as storage objects, and pipelines are taken as transportation mode, respectively. A mixed-integer linear programming model allowing for inter-source carbon allowance trading is developed to minimize the total annualized investment and operational costs of CCUS during the project's operational phase. The proposed model is applied to a specific case study and solved using GAMS solver. The results indicate that, under a framework that permitted carbon allowance trading among emission sources, the case achieves geological storage and utilization of 25.72 million tons of CO2 annually, with a marginal CO2 abatement cost of 139 CNY/t. This validates the reliability of the proposed CCUS model under the established carbon emissions trading policy and underscores the effectiveness of permitting inter-source carbon allowance trading measures in reducing the overall costs of carbon abatement projects.

The use of organic inputs in hydroponics can conserve dwindling non-renewable resources and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with inorganic nitrogen (N) fertilizer production and use. The study compared plant growth using organic liquid fertilizer (OLF) from insect and chicken waste in a two-step aerobic bioreactor. Basil (Ocimum basilicum) plants were grown with an inorganic fertilizer control and a novel OLF at two separate locations. In the first part of the study, plant yield, nutrient uptake and tissue elemental composition were used to validate the functional equivalency of OLF versus inorganic fertilizer. The second part of the study used these results to conduct a life-cycle assessment (LCA) to quantify GHG mitigation potential of the novel OLF. N-mass balance showed a liquid nitrogen conversion rate ∼40% for the bioreaction. Solid output from the bioreaction contained approximately 35% of the initial N. N-gaseous loss was approximately 25% of total N-input. Because the nature of gaseous N-loss was unknown, LCA modeled different scenarios varying the percent of gaseous N-loss as N2O, as it is the only nitrogen-based gas with appreciable global warming potential. Models showed that N2O leakage during bioreaction must be below 5% of total N-input for OLF to mitigate GHG emissions associated with fertilizer usage in urban hydroponic production. Further studies should focus on direct quantification and characterization of gaseous N-loss during this type of bioreaction.";"2024-09-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262402883X";"1";"Emissions"

Accurately predicting carbon prices can help create a stable carbon market and mitigate global warming. Therefore, a combined model which has four modules is proposed, they are the decomposition of carbon price series, reorganization of subsequences, point forecasting, and interval forecasting. For data preprocessing of decomposition, it can reduce the non-linearity of sequences. Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) decomposes the original series into multiple Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Reorganization uses SampEn (SE) and T-test to reorganize the decomposed sequence into three new sequences according to actual meanings. For point prediction, the combined prediction model uses Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) to obtain the optimal weights of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), which can integrate their strengths to improve prediction accuracy. Interval prediction is based on fitting the optimal distribution function by Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE). Different significance intervals can be obtained from the point prediction results and the distribution function. Empirical and comparative experiments show this combined model has excellent point and interval predictions. Besides, the significance and stability are demonstrated.

";" Artificial intelligence (AI) has great potential to address the carbon crisis, but unlocking its environmental benefits faces challenges. Income inequality, a key constraining factor, has received insufficient research attention. This study innovatively incorporates income inequality into the AI-carbon emissions relationship research framework. Using 2002–2019 panel data from 50 countries, we employ empirical methods to analyze how income inequality moderates the impact of AI technology on carbon emissions. Additionally, we utilize a panel threshold model to explore the nonlinear effects and heterogeneity of this moderating influence. Results show: (1) Overall, AI has a significant emission reduction effect; (2) Income inequality undermines the abatement benefits of AI, and when the income gap exceeds a threshold, the emission reduction effect of AI will be reversed; (3) The moderating effect exhibits heterogeneity across countries with different income levels, with the abatement efficacy of AI in low- and middle-income countries being more affected by inequality. The study reveals income disparity's constraint on AI's emission reduction potential, highlights the importance of considering social equity in AI development, provides a basis for designing fair and effective environmental policies, and offers insights into synergistically resolving the climate and inequality crises.

Conceptualization and deployment of carbon capture and storage (CCS) value chains require substantial resources with current CCS projects trailing behind expectations. To date few studies address the environmental impacts related to introducing CCS into existing value chains, and even fewer focus on the environmental efficiency of scaling-up CCS projects, despite the need for acceleration. Four scenarios were studied, resembling CCS projects at different capture capacities of 0.3, 1.5, 3.5 and 10 million tonnes of CO2 per year (mtpa) deployed within a Northern European region. Using attributional life cycle assessment, we demonstrate that permanent carbon storage today may furnish a 47–91% CO2 net-abatement potential depending on the CO2 source and geographical location of CCS projects. Despite limited operational data, results appear robust with general low uncertainty. Our environmental assessment show that capturing, conditioning and liquefaction account for the largest emission shares of the studied CCS value chains, ranging from 70 to 80%, which is heavily fluctuated by the carbon emission intensity of regional electricity production. Impacts related to permanent storage activities, such as offshore monitoring and well drilling are limited to less than 2% across all scenarios. Moreover, our study suggests that expanding the spatial geographical scope to accumulated 5000 km has a low influence on the efficiency of CCS value chains regardless of capture rate. Freshwater eutrophication shows the highest burden across the assessed environmental impact categories caused by the electricity production for capture processes. Lastly, we identify net-abatement improvement potential for post-combustion CCS projects at capturing capacities between 1.5 and 10 million tonnes per annum ranging from 10 to 20% for transport-related activities, and 60–68% for capturing processes when assuming net-zero energy scenarios.";"2024-09-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262402955X";"2";"Emissions"

Briquette technology is regarded as an efficient way to suppress pollutant emissions from solid fuel combustion. In this study, a novel method for coal briquette (for both bituminous and anthracite) is presented in which biomass is added as an additive (0–30%) in producing clean coals. The comprehensive evaluations of these briquettes were done by measurements of the major pollutants, including particulate matter (PM), elemental and organic carbon (EC and OC), inorganic ions, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Emission factors (EFs) for fine PM (PM2.5) and total carbon exhibited similar ranks between all coal groups, while the bituminous group yielded relatively higher EFs for the pollutants. The briquette technology showed a certain reduction effect in the bituminous group. The emission of coals, biomass, and their briquettes showed a substantial difference (>0.75) according to the coefficient of divergence. The EFs for total VOCs in bituminous, anthracite, and biomass groups ranged from 4.53 ± 0.45–23.4 ± 3.84, 0.68 ± 0.02–5.05 ± 0.02, and 140 ± 1.02 g/kg, respectively. An obvious watershed occurred in bituminous briquette with 15% biomass-added that increased emission beyond the additive amount, which highlighted the importance of mixing ratios for emission reduction.

Thus, quantifying carbon inequality caused by domestic trade is important for allocating emission-reduction tasks and improving emission-reduction efficiency. Considering domestic value chain (DVC) fragmentation in China, we use multiregional input–output tables to divide products into within-province trade products, traditional trade intermediate/final products, and DVC–related trade products. Then, we examine carbon intensity inequality (CII) under DVC fragmentation and, using Theil index to analyze the contributions of between-province economic differences, within-province trade structures, and related influencing factors to CII. Previous studies have mostly focused on issues related to global value chain fragmentation. We take the lead in exploring CII caused by DVC fragmentation, and for the first time decompose the composition of CII from the perspective of DVC fragmentation. In addition, the national CII is attempted to analyze its contribution at the provincial level for the first time, which is a new improvement and exploration of previous regional research perspectives. The empirical results show that China's CII is on an upward trend, with large changes between 2002 and 2007, and then stabilized between 2007 and 2010 due to the financial crisis, before entering a phase of rapid change after 2012. In terms of regional contribution, between-province inequality is the core to PCII, while within-province inequality is the key to CCII. In terms of province, the changes in between-province inequality are relatively stable at early period. In the middle and late stages, the temporal and spatial changes of PCII and CCII between provinces are obvious with “geographic stickiness” weakening. Specifically, the carbon transfer in the early study period is mostly concentrated in traditional trade products, and the share of carbon transfer in DVC-related trade products later rises significantly from 20.05% in 2002 to 36.32% in 2017, and the value-added transfer rises from 17.09% in 2002 to 27.65% in 2017. In terms of influencing factors, energy intensity remains an important component to CII. In addition, the uncertainties of the data and methodology used in this study are discussed and possible future research directions for expansion are elaborated. Finally, specific policy recommendations for mitigating carbon inequality are presented to inform the development of efficient carbon reduction strategies.

However, this significant source of CO2 has not yet been adequately addressed by most existing cement decarbonization processes. As such, systematic environmental and economic comparisons between different cement processes are essential. This paper proposes a new cement process (NCP) that uses natural gas to react with limestone to reduce CO2 emissions and simultaneously produce high-value-added chemical products (methanol). To explore strategies for further improving the performance of the CO2 emission reduction, two processes are developed, integrating the organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) units with the traditional cement process (TCP) and the NCP, namely TCP-ORC-CCS and NCP-ORC-CCS respectively. Life cycle assessment (LCA) and economic analysis were performed on the TCP, NCP, TCP-ORC-CCS, and NCP-ORC-CCS processes, revealing their advantages and limitations in different scenarios. LCA adopts the ""cradle to gate"" system boundary, which includes the whole cement process from ore mining to clinker generation and other processes used for carbon reduction. The LCA results show that four cement processes exhibit different environmental performances when choosing different allocation methods. Under economic allocation, the global warming potential (GWP) of TCP, NCP, TCP-ORC-CCS, and NCP-ORC-CCS are 933, 300, 432, and 194 kgCO2eq/ton·clinker, respectively. The comprehensive analysis indicates that NCP has the best comprehensive economic and environmental performance when natural gas and methanol prices are 332 and 319 $/ton, respectively. The price fluctuation of natural gas and methanol is found to greatly impact the levelized cost of clinker (LCOC) of NCP through sensitivity analysis. NCP is economically preferred over TCP when the price of methanol (MeOH) is at least $76 above approximately two-thirds of the price of methane (CH4). Similarly, NCP-ORC-CCS is more advantageous than TCP-ORC-CCS when the price of MeOH is at least $87 above nearly two-thirds of the price of CH4. This study provides a comprehensive analysis for low-carbon cement process design to achieve CO2 emissions reduction.

Measures to reduce CO2 can synergistically reduce PM2.5. This paper focuses on the transportation industry in China, which has high carbon and high pollution emissions. It initially evaluates the synergistic effect of CO2 emissions and the impact of other socio-economic drivers on PM2.5 emissions. Subsequently, it provides a comparative analysis of the projected trajectories of PM2.5 emissions, along with the associated health and economic repercussions, across three scenarios from 2021 to 2030. The results show that: (1) The synergy effect of CO2 reduction emerges as the primary driver for mitigating PM2.5 emissions, whereas economic growth stands as the primary contributor to their escalation.

One significant technological solution for reducing CO2 emissions in iron and steel production is the recycling of waste heat. Hot air sintering has the potential to decrease CO2 emissions from flue gas by reusing hot flue gas in the production process. This can result in a reduction in the consumption of fossil fuels. Usually, the relationship between the hot air temperature and the carbon content determines the CO2 emission reduction effect. In order to meet the demand for reducing CO2 emissions, this paper thoroughly investigates the mechanism of CO2 reduction by hot air sintering through sintering pot experiments. It precisely establishes the correlation between hot air temperature and carbon content, and suggests strategies for effectively managing hot air sintering based on scientific principles. The results show that hot air sintering achieves a reduction in CO2 emissions by enhancing fuel combustion heat utilization and heat substitution. On the one hand, the heat of the sinter bed surface layer is increased, which improves the mineralization conditions and increases the sintered mineral quantity and quality, thus reducing the CO2 emission by 4.4%; on the other hand, the waste heat is returned to the sinter bed to replace part of the fuel combustion heat, thus reducing the CO2 emission by 17.7%. The experimental results show that the best carbon reduction effect is achieved at a hot air temperature of 300 °C and a solid fuel ratio of 4.7% (labelled T300-C47), which reduces carbon emissions by 17.7% and improves the quality of the sintered minerals. Combined with the actual production, in the range of 200–300 °C hot air, by increasing the hot air temperature to replace the solid fuel with equal heat can realize the hot air sintering to reduce CO2 emissions and improve the sintering production. The research provides theoretical guidance for the clean production of iron and steel sintering and energy saving and carbon reduction.

The deep saline aquifer is a prime candidate for CO2 geological storage. The subsurface flow and effectiveness of CO2 storage in deep saline aquifer are highly related to the permeability heterogeneity of formations, which needs in-depth study. To bridge the gap, this study focused on quantifying the impact of permeability heterogeneity on the CO2 flow patterns, the well injectivity and the storage efficiency, which aims to enhance the understanding of CO2 storage characteristics in deep saline aquifers. The heterogeneous saline aquifer model was built by using the Sequential Gaussian Simulation (SGSIM) method. A novel classification template was proposed with the CO2 flow patterns classified as “Dispersive”, “Sweeping”, “Fingering”, and “Channeling” for CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers according to the geostatistical parameters (including dimensionless correlation lengths, first and second spatial moment, and Dykstra-Parsons coefficient). For the well injectivity, the results showed that high injectivity occurred when both horizontal and vertical correlation lengths were high or at a favourable connectivity of permeability in the horizontal and vertical directions. In addition, CO2 storage efficiency is higher when both dimensionless horizontal and vertical correlation lengths are in the range of 0.1–0.2. This is because frequent changes between high and low permeability regions led to frequent mutual displacement of water and CO2, resulting in higher residual trapping and slow CO2 front. Therefore, the dimensionless correlation lengths and breakthrough time should be considered simultaneously to achieve safer trapping and maximize the CO2 storage capacity. The findings of this work provide insights into the subsurface flow of CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers with permeability heterogeneity.

Carbon trading market is a widely used tool to promote proactive emissions reductions in the electricity industry in different regions. On this basis, inter-provincial trading in the power industry creates a hidden carbon transfer between producers and consumers of energy resources. Therefore, it is necessary to construct systematic multi-period emission reduction measures to deal with the conflict and coordination of the operation of the two systems. In this study, to promote orderly emission reductions in the power industry in areas with different natural resource endowments, a two-tier decision-making model for carbon allowances allocation based on interactive model predictive control technique is constructed. The model readjustss the overall allowances by tracking the implied carbon transfer flows between regions and implementing a production-oriented allowance compensation mechanism, forming an optimisation strategy for carbon compliance cost and emission intensity in the power sector. The experimental results show that adjusting the regional allowance distribution in inter-provincial transmission can alleviate the impact of high emission reduction pressure on the overall carbon compliance cost, while the rolling horizon optimisation of the carbon baseline value can approach the expected emission reduction target in stages. Taking the Southern Power Grid as an example, this study ultimately provides policy recommendations for sustainable emission reductions under multi-period inter-provincial trade in energy resources.

Nonetheless, adopting renewable energy sources not only aids in fulfilling these commitments but also reduces electricity prices, fostering a more competitive economy. This study aims to provide a thorough analysis and evaluation of the impact that integrating Non-Conventional Renewable Energy Resources (NCRER) has on Peru's wholesale electricity market. Specifically, it focuses on the net total savings for the system, calculated as the difference between the reduction in energy costs traded and the cost of the renewable premium. To reach that goal a simplified yet analytical tool has been developed based on a multivariable regression of the real data of the market. The volume of natural gas not consumed and the volume of GHG emissions avoided will also be evaluated. The results show that based on the 2021 scenario, a NCRER share of 28.26 % would lead to a net saving for the final users of 316.04 MUSD in the annual energy traded in the market. The reduction of conventional thermal generation prevents the annual burning of 2.04 normal km3 of natural gas and the emission of 4.99 million tons of CO2-eq.

However, it is uncertain whether the tax rates defined under the law are reasonable. Environmental tax reform would help the government improve the law's emission reduction effect. This paper aims to design tax schemes from the perspective of differential tax rates and propose environmental tax reform strategies. To support this goal, we adopted a directional distance function, meta-frontier analysis, and an exponential attenuation model to construct a differential tax rate model. Next, starting with the current differential provincial tax rates (scheme B), we proposed three-level differential tax rates, in which the adjusted provincial tax rates (scheme P), differential sector tax rates (scheme S), and differential province–sector tax rates (scheme P–S). Then, we analyzed three new tax schemes and proposed two step-by-step reform strategies. We selected SO2, NOx, and CO2 for empirical analysis. We found that in the short term, the government should prioritize scheme P and set more effective tax rates for SO2 and NOx. In the long term, the government should implement scheme P–S to consider both regional heterogeneity and industrial heterogeneity within a province. Specific measures should set a high tax rate for the light industry category and a low tax rate for energy production and heavy industry category. In addition, we propose that China should include a carbon tax in the scope of its environmental taxes. Our research provides valuable guidance for China's future environmental tax reform.

These data were usually recorded in closed static chambers, which did not reflect the actual rearing conditions. On the other hand, open respiration chambers need high amounts of substrate and insects, making the analyses time consuming and expensive. In the present study, a novel small-scale open gas exchange recording system for evaluation of GHG emissions from insects is presented. The device consists of four independent respiration chambers, each one equipped with a pump for supplying air, a flow meter and a septum for sampling the flowing air. A validation experiment was carried out using black soldier fly larvae as model organisms and moistened chicken feed (dry matter 40%) as rearing substrate. Three independent runs were conducted, each with two replicates, using 200 neonates larvae and 300 g of substrate. Moistened chicken feed (300 g) without larvae was used as control. Throughout the 12 days rearing period, gas sampling occurred every 12 h. Data interpolation considering a linear tendency between two successive sampling points was applied and overall amounts of gases were quantified as area under the curve. Irrespective of the run, CO2 emissions in the insect-substrate systems increased during the initial 7 d of experiment, consistently followed by a rapid decrease. Multiple cross correlation analysis showed high reproducibility (r ≥ 0.9), while significant differences in the CO2 emissions between insects-substrate system (range 7.76–11.88 g g−1 dry insects) and sole substrate (range 0.20–0.33 g g−1 initial dry substrate) were observed. Very limited N2O (≤1.13 mg g−1 dry insects) and CH4 (≤1.33 mg g−1 dry insects) emissions were detected in this experiment, indicating that the performed black soldier fly larvae rearing did not result in significant production of these GHGs.

We quantified the emissions responsibilities from both producer and consumer perspectives, adopting the ‘Beneficiaries are responsible' principle for allocation. Further, we calculated appropriate payments or subsidies for each province's emissions using the slacks-based Data Envelope Analysis (SBM-DEA), aiming to provide a fair and transparent reference for China's current fiscal transfer payment system. Our findings revealed significant progress in emission reductions between 2012 and 2017 by 36.64%–66.49% excluding Solid wastes. Provinces within the Yangtze River Delta and Guangdong were the primary emitters at the consumption end, while provinces in Central, Western, and Northeastern China bore the brunt of embodied emissions through trade at the production end. In 2012, a dominant emission transfer was from developed to undeveloped provinces. However, by 2017, a new trend emerged, with emissions being transferred between provinces with similar levels of financial development. The secondary industry was the largest adsorber for the emission transfer, and reductions in emissions from this sector benefited the output of provinces who experienced rapid development during 2012–2017. Based on the offsetting calculated by this work, the current transfer payments system in China is not fair for some provinces who paid more or accepted less than they deserved. Some provinces should take a more active gesture in pursing their development instead of relying upon the transfer which they do not deserve.

(2) The industrial air pollution linkage network exhibits small-world characteristics and path dependence, with different cities playing distinct roles in the network. (3) The evolution of the network is influenced by both exogenous and endogenous mechanisms. Local network structures such as reciprocity, connectivity, and transitivity make the network exhibit path-dependent characteristics. Cities’ attributes such as economic development level, green innovation capacity, and population density significantly influenced their status in the network and linkages between cities. Pollution linkages are more likely to occur in cities with similar levels of economic development, green technological innovation capacity, and institutional environments. Therefore, effective regional division for scientific collaborative governance should be considered from multiple perspectives. Based on these results, the paper provides several policy recommendations. ";"2024-09-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624027045";"8";"Emissions"

However, engines powered by ammonia produce considerably higher levels of NO x emissions compared to conventional fuel engines. In the present study, a combustion model for the marine dual-fuel engine fueled with natural gas and ammonia has been established using the CONVERGE software. The nitrogen element-tracking method is employed in the engine combustion simulation. This study aims to investigate the effects of ammonia blending ratio (X NH3 = 0% ∼ 50%) and spark ignition timing (SIT = −20 °CA ATDC ∼ −40 °CA ATDC) on the emission characteristics and spatiotemporal distribution of nitrogen-based pollutants under lean-burn and stoichiometric-burn conditions. The results indicate that as the X NH3 increases, total NO x emissions decrease at stoichiometric-burn conditions, while it initially increases and then decreases at lean-burn conditions, reaching a peak of 3760 ppm at X NH3 = 30%. Besides, fuel NO emissions are predominant at lean-burn conditions, whereas at stoichiometric-burn conditions, thermal N*O emissions are predominant. Additionally, as the SIT advances, total NO x emissions initially decrease and then remain unchanged, reaching a minimum at −35 °CA ATDC, and it gradually increases at lean-burn combustions. Furthermore, the spatial distribution of NO at CA50 illustrates that fuel NO is primarily concentrated at the flame front, while thermal N*O predominates in the high-temperature burned region. N2O is observed in the low-temperature region near the cylinder wall during the expansion stroke. Moreover, fuel NO is primarily produced by ammonia's decomposition with OH radicals. There are three dominant reactions for the formation of NO: HNO→NO, NH→NO, and N→NO. The coupling mechanism of carbon and nitrogen elements is achieved by H2CN and HCN radicals.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.143312";"Impacts of carbon emissions allowance limitations on carbon price with power generation rights trading in China ";" Carbon pricing is a crucial mechanism for achieving carbon peaking and carbon neutrality through the carbon trading market. Recently, the price of carbon emissions allowances in China's national carbon market has shown a gradual upward trend. The limitations on carbon emissions allowances have also become increasingly stringent. Power generators, which primarily rely on thermal power generation, have a substantial demand for carbon emissions allowances. The rising prices and stricter carbon emissions constraints have increased operational costs. Therefore, exploring the carbon pricing mechanism under more stringent carbon emissions allowance constraints is vital. It encourages thermal power generators to engage in carbon trading and reduce carbon emissions. This paper focuses on an energy trading platform supply chain comprising three power generators, one energy trading platform, and one power retailer. We consider stringent carbon emissions constraints and power generation rights trading. Through the analysis of three scenarios, the study explores optimal pricing decisions for carbon emissions allowances to facilitate carbon emission reduction and promote renewable energy generation and consumption. The findings indicate that, under certain conditions (i.e., the carbon quotas allocation coefficient b 1 ∈ [ 0.73 , 0.8 ] ), scenario 3, which excludes generation rights trading, yields the highest optimal carbon price. The energy trading platform can adjust various commissions to influence the carbon price, as well as the price and quantity of generation rights trading. Introducing power generation rights trading proves beneficial in reducing carbon emissions (nearly 400 tons less than that in scenario 3 without generation rights trading, when the realized total power demand is around 8600 MWh) and fostering renewable power generation and consumption (the actual renewable power consumption weight is 3% higher than that without generation rights trading). When considering generation rights trading, the high-emission generator and renewable power generator achieve the highest power profits, while for the low-emission generator, the profit in this case is the second best among these scenarios. Moreover, by decreasing the coefficient of carbon quotas allocation and increasing the reduction rate simultaneously, the carbon cost will pass through to the electricity price more sufficiently (e.g., when b 1 = 0.76 , the pass-through rate increases from 0.5015 to 0.7984), particularly within a specific range of the carbon quotas allocation coefficient.

Onboard carbon capture and storage (OCCS) offers a practical short-term solution for reducing shipping-related CO2 emissions until cleaner technologies are ready for large-scale adoption. This study introduces an innovative multi-objective approach to integrate sustainability into the conceptual design and decision-making phases of OCCS. A systematic technology screening identified possible OCCS solutions, which were then assessed for onboard feasibility. Specific indicators were defined to evaluate OCCS performance based on technological, economic, environmental, and social criteria, and aggregated sustainability perspectives. Using a fossil fuel-powered cruise ship as a case study, results were benchmarked against zero-carbon alternatives. Among the alternatives considered, chemical absorption by amine scrubbing (AS) and advanced cryogenic carbon capture (A3C) appeared as the only feasible solutions considering onboard energy requirements. The emerging cryogenic A3C concept resulted in being outperformed by benchmark AS, primarily due to an environmental impact 1.5 times higher. All alternative technologies, whether OCCS- or cleaner fuel-based, were found to be more sustainable than the baseline fossil fuel-based engine, lowering the environmental impact by at least 61%. Hydrogen as a marine fuel leads to the most promising scenario for future cleaner shipping operations, reducing the sustainability footprint by up to 76%. The robustness of the proposed method was confirmed by a probabilistic Monte Carlo sensitivity analysis. Overall, the results obtained can guide toward more informed solutions and policies promoting the sustainability of ship propulsion systems.";"2024-09-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624027926";"9";"Emissions"

However, our institutions are struggling to find new intervention types to accelerate the transition. This paper analyses this struggle by combining agency theories and discursive approaches to study transition intermediaries, i.e, organizations seeking to foster the transition activities of others. The internal meaning structures of intermediaries are described as interlocking shared action frames, i.e., beliefs and meanings underpining their activities. These frames are characterized through the definition of pairs of contrasting frame elements along eleven framing dimensions. This conceptualization allows for a semi-quantitative mapping of internal structures. The method is developped and illustrated with the in-depth case study of a Swiss regional utility department running an energy efficiency programme. Analysing a series of exploratory workshops, we find that established frames revolve around technology-oriented, managerial approaches to the transition, ultimately narrowing the range of imaginable interventions. While these are well-studied shortcomings of energy efficiency centred approaches, further observations suggest that these frames underpin the perception of intervention impacts, helping keep staff and recipients involved. To strike a balance between energy saving targets and transformative ambitions, this paper suggests revising programme evaluation logics and reframing technological solutions as responses, rather than substitutes, to practice changes.";"2024-09-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624025253";"3";"Emissions"

Malaysia is pledging to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and has subsequently identified Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) as one of the solutions for carbon removal from its energy sector by 2050. However, the implementation of CCS presents formidable challenges, encompassing both technical and commercial complexities, especially for a nation like Malaysia, which has limited experience in large-scale CCS deployment. This study evaluates the feasibility of CCS implementation in Malaysia's fossil fuel power plants by conducting a comprehensive techno-economic assessment, taking into considerations the prevailing energy landscape of the country. This assessment is very crucial to demonstrate the feasibility of this plan within the timeframe, considering the limited research have been done to assess a national-scale implementation, as well as to provide the important insights for future policy implication to promote CCS adoption. The CCS scenarios are assessed through an analytical approach, and comparative analyses are conducted between alternative paths. The result shows that a large-scale implementation of CCS at Malaysia's fossil fuel power plant to achieve net-zero emission by 2050 are feasible given a strong enforcement on emission policy and establishment of CCS legal framework. CCS can potentially reduce 60% of Malaysia's energy sector total emissions, and a solar-supported CCS helps to reduce it further. Levelized Cost of Electricity analysis reveals that the implementation of CCS leads to only a minimal increase between pre- and post-CCS LCOE when carbon price is considered. A SWOT-PESTLE analysis was also conducted to identify gaps in regulatory framework, financial and social aspects. It can be concluded that CCS is a techno-economically viable solution, however Malaysia's readiness for CCS implementation is still at a very novice stage, and aggressive actions are needed to enable a successful full-scale implementation.";"2024-09-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624026222";"10";"Emissions"

The simultaneous need for electricity and high-temperature heat is what makes some industrial processes difficult to decarbonize via current commercially available technologies. As the demand for materials and goods is expected to grow in the upcoming years, it is crucial to define which strategies and technologies will serve as the cornerstone of sustainable development. This study addresses the imperative need for emission reduction of energy-intensive sectors by proposing a novel hydrogen-based cogeneration system in the framework of the paper and pulp industry, with the aim of providing general insights relevant to a broader spectrum of similar applications. The comparative analysis presented in this work focuses on three cogeneration options aimed at satisfying the paper mill energy needs: a conventional natural gas-fuelled gas turbine, a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) fed with grey hydrogen produced via steam methane reforming, and a SOFC operating using green hydrogen produced on-site. The latter involves an integrated multi-energy system with photovoltaic panels, electrolyzers, compressors, and storage tanks. Indeed, the SOFC potential of supplying electricity and high-temperature heat in the form of pressurized steam for industrial applications has not been well investigated yet and represents one of the main objectives of this work. Building on the real consumption profiles of a paper mill facility, techno-economic analyses are carried out for many system configurations, varying components size and layout to assess their performance with respect to CO2 emissions and two key economic parameters, the Levelized Cost of Hydrogen (LCOH) and the net present cost. An in-house-developed flexible simulation framework is presented and expanded for the purposes of this study, including a detailed model that accounts for design and off-design performance of a SOFC cogeneration unit. Results demonstrate that integrating a SOFC with a heat recovery steam generator result in a 75% reduction in the mass flow of generable pressurized steam in comparison to a gas turbine. Additionally, in the cost-optimal scenario, CO2 emissions are 25% lower than the conventional gas turbine-based configuration, achieving complete independence from the electricity grid and an LCOH of 5.81€/kg without considering revenues from electricity sold.";"2024-09-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624027033";"7";"Emissions"

However, because existing CO2 emission datasets are mostly limited to national and provincial levels and have significant time lags, there are few studies on urban emission patterns and drivers below the annual level. In this study, utilizing near-real-time daily CO2 emission data from Carbon Monitor Cities-China, we analyzed the seasonality and peak patterns of city-level emissions and conducted a decomposition of emission drivers by sector based on sociometric and natural factors. Our results indicated that most cities in China exhibited seasonal emissions, with peak emissions occurring during winter.

Produced through the thermochemical conversion of biomass to biochar followed by densification, this process yields a renewable briquette that imitate coal in mechanical attributes and combustion efficiency, while maintaining a carbon-neutral profile. Findings indicates that substituting biochar briquettes for coal has the potential to reduce methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by approximately 40%. The densification stage plays a crucial role in converting biochar which has low bulk density (0.2 g cm−3 to 0.4 g cm−3), into a coal-like energy product. Thus, effectively addressing concerns associated with handling, transportation, and storage. To ensure the fabrication of high-quality biochar briquettes, particular attention must be directed towards the choice of binder, compaction technology, and operational conditions. In addition, critical briquette quality parameters such as density, mechanical durability, calorific value, and volatile species are influenced by the binder. The optimal binder loading ranges from 5 to 15% depending on the feedstock and pyrolysis temperature. Biochar briquettes produced under these conditions tend to exhibit durability values ranging from approximately 70%–90%. While the existing literature offers broad insights into pyrolysis conditions for various biomass types, available densification technologies, and binder options for biochar briquetting, a more comprehensive understanding of how these factors impact the mechanical and environmental performance is lacking. This review aims to bridge this knowledge gap.

In this study, an innovative preheating system for natural gas is proposed, which is called the “Direct Geothermal Heating System” (DGHS). The main idea is to inject high-pressure natural gas into geothermal wells before the throttling valve; thus, natural gas is directly heated by the surrounding strata when it flows through the geothermal well. A proper temperature for natural gas should be ensured, as natural gas goes back to the ground for pressure regulation. The idea is performed based on the preheating configuration using coaxial deep borehole heat exchangers (DBHE). A mathematical model describing the flow and heat transfer processes of DGHS through DBHE is established to study its heat transfer characteristics. Additionally, the environmental and economic benefits of the proposed configuration are also investigated. Through the CGS case in this paper, the findings indicate that, over the fifteen years of preheating with a DBHE depth of 2000 m and inlet flow rate of 4.39 × 107 Nm³/year, the outlet temperature of the throttling valve remains within the range of 17 °C–37 °C, meeting the heating requirement of CGS. Among fifteen preheating cycles, the average peak heating power of the DBHE reaches 105.78 kW. In addition, in the 15th year, the proposed system has a 1/3 cost of a traditional line heater, along with a reduction of 46.43 × 105 kg in CO2 emission.

In summary, this paper argues that China should steadily advance energy transition, avoiding either too fast or too slow a pace (bring clean energy consumption transition to within the 0.535–0.595 range by 2030), in order to secure economic growth while honoring its commitment to peak carbon. Therefore, China should prudently design a coal exit strategy to avoid falling into the energy trilemma when promoting energy transition. Moreover, if China wants to further fulfill its commitment to carbon neutrality by 2060, it needs to continue to deepen the construction of green financial markets in order to better balance the relationship between energy cleanliness and economy.

A thorough analysis becomes imperative in complex decision problems where various factors influence outcomes. Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) methods have emerged as valuable tools for addressing such challenges, enabling decision-makers to navigate through conflicting criteria and make informed choices. Combined with sensitivity analysis approaches, comprehensive assessments can be achieved, ensuring the robustness of decision-making processes. To increase the reliability of the results, different aspects of input data fluctuations should be examined to provide a broader view of the stability of the results. This paper proposes a comprehensive multi-dimensional sensitivity analysis approach to assess the robustness of renewable energy source (RES) development in selected European countries. By evaluating RES management in terms of electricity and energy consumption and generation, the study addresses key components of sustainable development. It offers a holistic perspective on result reliability and stability by analyzing five sensitivity dimensions: a comparative analysis of four MCDA methods, varying criteria weights scenarios, probabilistic modifications, criteria relevance identification, and ranking stability. This approach enhances decision-making in sustainable energy development, providing valuable insights for policymakers on prioritizing sustainable technologies.

Empirical evidence from China ";" The rise in carbon emissions linked to the tourism industry has challenged its long-standing reputation as an eco-friendly sector. In parallel, the digital economy's evolution has introduced a series of transformations within tourism. This necessitates a thorough examination of the intricate interplay between the digital economy and carbon emissions in the tourism sector. With the help of Chinese provincial panel data, this study uncovers a compelling relationship marked by an inverted “U"" curve through two-way fixed model, moderated effects model and threshold regression analysis. Intriguingly, an increase in road density shifts the inflection point of this curve to the lower left. As road density reaches a critical threshold of 0.361, it not only amplifies the elasticity of the inverted “U"" curve but also accelerates the timeline to reach peak tourism-related carbon emissions. This study underscores a significant practical implication: while digital technology exacerbates carbon emissions from tourism at this stage, the dampening effect of digital technology is to be expected as the development of industrial manufacturing brings better transportation. However, the timing of the tipping point may be earlier or later for different regions, depending on whether the local level of industry is sufficiently developed.

However, optimal strategies to mitigate the financial challenges of deep decarbonization are still underexplored. This study aims to optimize government subsidy strategies and users' system designs to facilitate cost-effective deep decarbonization using game theory. Two indicators, the renewable generation rate (RGR) and the self-sufficiency rate (SSR), are formulated to understand the principles of achieving deep decarbonization. Additionally, the study introduces a new strategy called subsidy plus energy storage service (SUB + ESS), contrasting it with the traditional subsidy-only strategy. Key findings indicate that merely increasing the RGR requirements does not achieve deep decarbonization due to energy mismatches. Restricting the SSR requirements proves effective in achieving deep decarbonization but imposes a significant economic burden on the government. When the SSR requirement is set at 100%, carbon emissions are reduced by 93%, but the government's subsidy expenditure increases nearly fivefold. In contrast to the subsidy-only strategy, the novel SUB + ESS strategy, with a 100% SSR requirement, reduces government expenditure by approximately 52% and lowers total expenditure by 19.7%. A two-stage decarbonization strategy is proposed: initially, offering subsidies is sufficient, but as deeper decarbonization is pursued, establishing energy storage service becomes essential.

Low-carbon alcohols accumulate important intermediates at low temperatures and undergo rapid cracking and oxidation at high temperatures to produce reactive radicals such as OH, H2O2, C2H4, and CH3. These reactive radicals play a key role in accelerating chain reactions and reducing emissions of pollutants such as CO, HC, and PM. In order to accurately predict the combustion characteristics of large-molecule hydrocarbons and small-molecule low-carbon alcohols, in this study, a generalized new mechanism for chemical kinetic analysis of RP-3 aviation kerosene/low-carbon alcohol blended fuel was developed. Based on this blending mechanism, the ignition characteristics and chemical reaction kinetic analysis under different alcohol types and blending ratios were investigated. It was shown that at 1300 K, n-butanol could enhance the fuel oxidation most effectively, accelerating the peak time of O and OH radicals by nearly 12% and the peak time of the CH4 component by nearly 13% compared with that of ethanol. While the ethanol blending ratio of 30%, improved the peak rate of O, OH radicals by nearly 4%, the CH4 mole concentration peak enhancement was nearly 9%, proving that with the increase of the blending ratio, the rate of accumulation of reactive radicals increased, the reaction rate of the blended fuel was accelerated.

Agricultural machinery in China's mountainous areas is represented by quantities of small conventional tractors and hillside mini-tillers (HMTs), which are highly fuel-intensive and polluting. Effective measures need to be taken to reduce their environmental impacts. Thus, a diesel-electric hybrid tractor (DHT) was designed and developed. The life cycle assessment (LCA) method was used to assess and compare the energy consumption and environmental impacts of the DHT, an internal combustion engine tractor (ICET), and an HMT in this study. Comparative results present that the ICET had the most contribution to acidification potential (AP), eutrophication potential (EP), and respiratory inorganics (RI), while the HMT created the most to primary energy demand (PED), global warming potential (GWP), and photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP). The DHT had the lowest contribution to six environmental impact indicators, 5.1%–68.9% lower than those of ICET and HMT. Among the six phases in the life cycle, the Pump-to-Wheel (PTW) phase consumed the most energy (65.9%–78.5%) and brought about the largest environmental impacts (54.2%–94.7%), followed by the Well-to-Pump (WTP) phase (4.0%–37.3%). Increasing the proportion of electricity generation from non-fossil fuels in 2030 showed positive effects on saving energy and reducing environmental impacts for the ICET, DHT, and HMT, with the DHT benefiting the most. Discoveries in this study can contribute to the research and development of the DHT and the electrification of small agricultural machinery.

With growing awareness of its environmental impact, the construction sector is looking to transition from a linear economy “take-make-waste” scenario towards more circular economy principles. Lightweight exterior infill walls are built between floors of primary structural frames to provide building façades. The design of these components is usually based on the current linear economic model. While lightweight exterior infill walls are becoming increasingly common in building construction in the UK, no studies have investigated the potential environmental benefits of designing them with circularity in mind. This means there's a lack of research on both the carbon footprint of these walls and the potential environmental benefits of reusing them. Thus, this article assesses the significance of the carbon emissions from lightweight exterior infill walls and examines whether there is any carbon reduction when lightweight exterior infill walls are demounted from the building frames and reused. This paper first examines the construction process of lightweight exterior infill walls and explores the opportunity to demount and reuse them. Then, the environmental impacts of the lightweight exterior infill walls are analysed using a lifecycle assessment framework. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses are also conducted. The results demonstrate that (i) the embodied carbon of the lightweight exterior infill walls over their lifecycle represents approximately 22% of the embodied carbon of the entire building, and (ii) the disassembly and reuse of infill walls can reduce a building's embodied carbon over its typical lifetime by about 6% compared to the linear scenario where the walls were not reused.";"2024-09-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624025101";"5";"Emissions"

Here, we investigated the quantitative relevance of considering postharvest N2O measurements when calculating annual soil N2O emissions from herbaceous crops (excluding rice). Data from 25 studies conducted in Mediterranean climates were compiled from a variety of crops and cropping systems, soil types, tillage practices, and nitrogen (N) fertilizer management practices. The differences between cumulative N2O emissions in the cropping period (preharvest emissions) and in the postharvest period were evaluated through a meta-analysis, as were the maximum N2O peaks in both periods and the resultant N2O emission factors (EFs). The relative contribution of the postharvest period to total cumulative N2O emissions was a mean 26%, but showed high variability. The average N2O EFs in the field experiments included in this study were 0.21% and 0.27% when not considering and when considering the postharvest period, respectively. The relative and absolute contribution of postharvest emissions was significantly greater for winter cereals than for either horticultural crops or maize. The maximum preharvest fluxes were higher than the maximum postharvest fluxes in 72% of the observations, but notable postharvest N2O peaks after soil rewetting were obtained in some studies. On average, postharvest emissions in nonfertilized plots were similar to those in fertilized winter crops. Other factors such as N source (greater relevance for organic fertilizers, particularly in summer crops), N rate, tillage intensity and soil texture significantly affected the amount of postharvest emissions. Taking measurements during the postharvest period in Mediterranean cropping systems are encouraged in studies that include winter crops, use of organic fertilizers or have unbalanced N rates.

In this context, enhancing the urban ecological carrying capacity (UECC)– defined as the ability to sustain human activities without compromising environmental quality – emerges as a pivotal concern. To address these issues, the Chinese government has instituted the “Low Carbon Pilot Cities policy” initiative (LCPP), aiming to foster sustainable urban development by encouraging cities to adopt measures that reduce carbon emissions and enhance energy efficiency. This paper treats the policy as an exogenous quasi-natural experiment, employing a spatial double-difference methodology to assess its impact on the ecological carrying capacity of 281 Chinese cities from 2006 to 2021. Utilizing the pressure-state-response (PSR) model, this study constructs and evaluates their ecological carrying capacity. The findings reveal that: firstly, the low-carbon pilot policies significantly augment urban ecological carrying capacities; secondly, the policy's effects exhibit regional variability; thirdly, these policies bolster ecological carrying capacity through innovation-driven and energy structure optimization mechanisms; and fourthly, a further spatial spillover analysis indicates that the policy implementation adversely affects the ecological carrying capacity of adjacent cities.

Existing research tends to discuss government incentive policies for remanufacturers separately from carbon restricting policies for manufacturers, with little analysis of the effects of the simultaneous implementation of both types of policies. The Stackelberg game is a widely used model in integrated energy systems that can be used to effectively solve the management and control problems of integrated energy systems. This study takes carbon quota policy and production subsidy as the background, constructs the game model consisting of government subsidy and carbon quota policy under different allocation methods, and compares optimal decision-making, environmental benefit, and consumer surplus with a single subsidy policy or a single carbon quota policy. We built a coordination mechanism to improve the whole supply chain, and the results show that compared with a single policy, the combination of government subsidy with the benchmarking law is more conducive to maximizing the profits of remanufacturers. Appropriate governmental subsidies can also help those original equipment manufacturers make greater profits if they adjust their emission reduction investment in time. Appropriate government subsidies and emission reduction investment can stimulate both the production and consumption of new products. With adequate subsidy, the combination of the grandfathering law and government subsidy is more conducive than the single policy to improving the effectiveness of emission reduction policies. In addition, consumer surplus is higher under hybrid policies than under a single policy. With the implementation of hybrid policies, cost and fixed cost sharing mechanisms can further improve overall supply chain profitability.

The method of model combination and outlier incorporation have proved to be practical solutions for strengthening model accuracy. 3) In the next 3–5 years, the NEV industry will enter a stage characterized by steady progress with an upward trend. Adapting the intensity, scope, and direction of policy support, coupled with achieving technological breakthroughs and enhancing infrastructure construction, are essential for sustaining industrial development and attaining desired objectives.

The transcritical CO2 system has gained popularity due to its exceptional heating efficiency and environmental benefits. This study aims to evaluate the energy and environmental potentials for transcritical CO2 systems in high-speed trains based on four-vertical-and-four-horizontal railway lines within different climatic regions of China. A high-fidelity transcritical CO2 system model was first developed and validated through experiments. Then, a comprehensive energy and environmental evaluation method was proposed and applied to the four-vertical-and-four-horizontal railway lines. The results indicated that the transcritical CO2 system had a superior heating performance and competitive cooling performance based on daily and annual operations. Furthermore, the transcritical CO2 system exhibited significant environmental advantages with lower total life cycle climate performance for all lines, with an average emissions reduction ratio of 17.6% and a maximum emissions reduction ratio of 26.98%. These findings highlight the competitive energy performance and outstanding environmental benefits offered by transcritical CO2 systems as promising alternatives to air conditioning systems in railway transportation.

Among various regulatory measures, market-oriented approaches are most favored by governments worldwide. Using provincial panel data from 2004 to 2020, a multi-period DID model was hereby constructed to empirically study the pollution reduction effects of the pilot policy for carbon emissions trading in China. Findings of this paper could be listed as follows: (1) The pilot policy has achieved notable reductions in waste gas and solid waste, although its effect on wastewater pollutants has been less pronounced; (2) Pollution reduction in the pilot regions can be achieved by optimizing the energy consumption structure; (3) Significant variations in pollution reduction effects are observed between the Northern and Southern pilot regions, with notably stronger policy effects in the north across various pollutants compared to the south. Overall, this paper offers pertinent policy recommendations to aid the Chinese government in enhancing its carbon market.

This divide has posed a substantial hurdle to implementing a unified climate policy in the U.S. In this paper, I employ the Shapley value decomposition approach to measure the partisan gap in state-level per capita energy-related CO2 emissions. Despite a decrease in overall carbon emissions and stable per capita carbon inequality between states (measured by the Gini index), the inequality between the so called ‘red’ and ‘blue’ states widened over the period between 1997 and 2021. This is true regardless of whether each state is treated as a unit of analysis or assigned a weight equal to its population. Throughout the period, the divide by political party color was more pronounced than that by many other dimensions, such as income, climatic condition, and geographic location. These results also hold true when Mean Log Deviation is used as the measure of inequality. Driven primarily by disparity in transportation sector and coal use for electricity generation, the partisan gap was worse in 2021 than in 2020. While the partisan gap intensified, the carbon distribution changed from being top-concentrated to bottom-concentrated between 1997 and 2019, only to be reversed in the aftermath of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 and subsequent economic recovery in 2021.";"2024-08-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624025769";"1";"Emissions"

By building a multiregional input-output model that distinguishes firm ownership, we measured the carbon emissions produced by Chinese multinational enterprises (MNEs) in B&R countries in reality and set two extreme counterfactual scenarios to evaluate the emission impacts of Chinese MNEs' overseas production activities on B&R countries: In Scenario 1, Chinese MNEs' production activities in B&R countries were replaced by local domestic producers; and in Scenario 2, the same amounts of outputs produced by Chinese MNEs in B&R countries were imported from China. We find that compared to the reality, in Scenario 1, a total carbon emission increase of 29.06 million tons (Mt) was observed in B&R countries, while in Scenario 2, a cumulative emission increase of 165.00 Mt worldwide, from the year 2005–2016, was observed indicating that the foreign direct investment related production activities of Chinese MNEs create a ‘green’ benefit for B&R countries and the world. Case studies show the detailed emissions mitigation effects of Chinese MNEs.

Hence, it is imperative to fully understand the current state of carbon emissions in agriculture and accurately evaluate emissions throughout various farming processes. This review aims to understand and evaluate these emissions, focusing on the agricultural sector. A systematic review of existing literature and data on agricultural carbon emissions was conducted, exploring the potential of innovative technology and approaches for mitigation. The effectiveness of energy-saving carbon emission reduction strategies and the role of technological innovation in achieving environmentally sustainable agriculture were assessed. The findings reveal that sustainable development goals have fostered a global strategy for achieving highly productive, efficient, and environmentally sustainable agriculture. In addition, potential transitions towards more sustainable agricultural practices, driven by technological innovation and effective carbon policies, were identified as significant means for mitigating carbon emissions. In this sense, there is an urgent need for a close global effort to implement carbon policies and technological innovation to mitigate the climate impacts of agriculture. Therefore, this research is a time-noting study to help international policymakers achieve environmental sustainability-oriented policies.

Shareholders increasingly value these commitments, conveying the impression of good future carbon performance. However, a critical question emerges: why do some companies progress better than others toward their climate mitigation targets? There is currently a lack of empirical literature assessing companies’ progress against their mitigation targets. Using a new indicator to evaluate the progress against individual corporate climate mitigation targets in a comparable manner, this study presents an explanatory analysis of 120 determinants applied to 4341 climate mitigation targets (scope 1 and 2 emissions) of 2975 companies reporting to the 2020 CDP questionnaire. The target progress assessment shows that 30% of targets have increased emissions since their base year, 15% have reduced their emissions but not at a sufficient pace, while 55% were on track to achieving or had already achieved their targets. In addition, 18% of targets were already achieved the year the target was set, which may be due to choosing a base year with unusually high emissions. The findings reveal 19 key determinants significantly associated with the progress against corporate targets and highlight future research orientation. Our results indicate better progression by companies having absolute targets with longer timeframes and disclosing additional, as well as remuneration links to climate-related issues. Companies with more ambitious targets progress less than others, except when the ambitious targets are approved by the Science-Based Targets initiative. The latter implies ambitious targets from some firms may only be symbolic, and that investors should consider both target ambition and progress. Clear guidance and regulations should be implemented by policymakers to prevent misleading target information.

Forests have received considerable attention as an important source of carbon sequestration, especially following China's commitment to carbon neutrality. However, studies have paid little attention to spatiotemporal differences of downscale forest carbon sequestration in China over the long term due to data limitations, while also ignoring the large differences in forest carbon sequestration per unit area among different regions. Here, a basic dataset of forest carbon sequestration among counties and grids in China is constructed and the temporal drivers and spatial differences of forest carbon sequestration were investigated from the perspectives of counties' administrative boundaries and 0.5 by 0.5 degree grid combining modelling, GIS spatial analysis and a decomposition method. Changes in forest land use between 2000 and 2020 were also analysed. The results highlight the importance of forests in managing carbon sequestration among all types of terrestrial vegetation and the differences in forest carbon sequestration per unit area. The scale effect increased forest carbon sequestration in the first two periods (2000–2005 and 2005–2010), followed by a decrease since 2010. The intensity effect promoted carbon sequestration; in particular, a dramatic increase was observed from the second (2005–2010) to the third period (2010–2015). The heterogeneity of the scale effect of forest carbon sequestration increased compared to that of the intensity effect, both from administrative and geographical divisions. The scale and intensity effects of counties located in the northern regions of northeast China enhanced forest carbon sequestration, while counties located in southern and central China inhibited it during the study period. The scale effect of grids changed from enhanced to inhibited forest carbon sequestration mainly in northeast China near 120°E, whereas the intensity effect of grids increased from inland regions in central China to eastern coastal regions during the study period. This study provides references for policymakers to set differentiated emission reduction targets considering the local forest carbon sequestration.

With the target of carbon neutrality, the global top-class Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Urban Agglomeration which confronts with the dual pressure of excess carbon emissions and shrink ecological space has increased its carbon reduction coordination cooperation, among which energy consumption carbon emission control and natural resource sink maintenance have been recognized as the key strategy. However, the study on carbon balance prediction is lack and the amount of energy consumption carbon emissions in the future can be offset by the ecological carbon sink is still unknown. To estimate the gap to carbon neutrality, this study proposes a framework for carbon offset analysis and prediction which takes various carbon emission scenarios and the potential of natural resource on carbon reduction into consideration. After the framework conduction in the agglomeration, it is revealed that the regional least carbon emissions of 29.51 Mt mainly derive from the population and economic growth brought by urbanization process, while the carbon sink predicted to be 2552.31 Kt is still far to cover the emissions. With the regional carbon offset rate decline from 0.68% to 0.63%, the ecological carbon sink in Beijing will offset 1.21% of its carbon emission, while the least ecological space keep city Tianjin is predicted to suffer the lowest offset rate of 0.09%.

MPs’ presence in lake sediment has been confirmed to be aged, necessitating a reassessment of their influence on GHG emissions. This study aims to investigate the impacts of MPs with various aging methods on organic carbon decomposition and GHG release in urban lake sediments. During the four-week duration of the microcosm experiment, the conventional polyethylene (PE) and biodegradable Poly (butylene-adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) MPs were subjected to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) and biological aging methods to investigate their impacts on carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emissions from lake sediment. Compared to pristine PE, pristine PBAT significantly exacerbated the detrimental impact on CO2 and CH4 emissions by 21.61% and 43.13%, respectively, mainly due to 10% increase in dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 22.65% increase in microbial biomass carbon (MBC). The surface morphology and functional groups of MPs were changed obviously after aging, thereby influencing the decomposition potential of organic carbon and the capacity of microbial reproduction. The aging process of PBAT reduced the available nutrients for microbial activity due to its rapid degradation, leading to a pronounced inhibitory effect on microbial respiration. Besides, MPs aging altered the microbial relative abundance of phyla Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, as well as families Lutispora and Azospirillaceae, thus exerting influence on capacity and anaerobic proportion of microbial respiration.

The study assessed the CE impact of local food production on the NDC of ceasing food imports under the Food Revolution Program (FRP). Findings indicated that Mongolia could not sustainably feed the population solely with domestic foods while achieving carbon mitigation goals concurrently. Relying on domestic production, it was projected that there would be a 7% increase in CE within agricultural food production, which constitutes 15% of the total emissions of the agriculture sector. The NDC targets an 18% (5238 Gg CO2eq) reduction in the agriculture sector by 2030; the study concluded that the mitigation goal would drop to 16.5% if foods are produced domestically under the FRP. This underscores the necessity of a strategic combination of local production (such as carrots, hen eggs, and rapeseed) and imports (like cabbage, cucumber, tomatoes, and chicken from the People's Republic of China) could effectively mitigate the CE.

The multi-layer perspective on the socioeconomic drivers of household-driven carbon emissions downscales the driver analyses from the aggregated level to the level of individual industrial chain paths. This can support refined household mitigation measures at the path level, which has not been well characterized. This study investigated the multi-layer drivers of critical industrial chain paths responsible for the changes of household-driven carbon emissions in China during 2012–2020. The top-ranked industrial chain paths, regarding the total amount, the increment, and the driving effects of household-driven emissions, were identified as critical paths. From the consumption perspective, per capita consumption was the main driver for shorter (0th and 1st layers) paths during 2012–2018. During 2018–2020, per capita consumption and carbon emission intensity were the dominant drivers for urban and rural paths, respectively. From the income perspective, the intermediate output structural effect contributed over 45% of the emissions in longer (than 1st layer) paths during 2012–2018. From 2018 to 2020, the changes in per capita income had the largest impact on the critical paths in each production layer. Furthermore, for a particular industrial chain path, multi-layer drivers could have opposite effects on household-driven emissions across different time periods. These findings demonstrate the importance of the multi-layer perspective in revealing new industrial chain hotspots for carbon reductions at the household level.

While these studies have typically used income or household expenditures as a proxy of households’ living standards, the association between emissions and wealth has hardly been studied. Wealth is not just an important component of households’ material living standards, known to be imperfectly correlated with income and expenditures, but it is also a very relevant dimension for climate policies. For instance, affluent households have more scope to invest in reducing emissions (e.g. insulation of their homes). Therefore, in this paper, we compare the inequality of emissions over wealth groups as well as groups defined by other living standard concepts such as income, expenditure and the joint distribution of income and wealth to add a focus on wealth to the analysis of emission inequality. Our study focuses on Belgium and the United Kingdom, which differ considerably in their level of wealth inequality. Our results highlight that the social distribution of emissions varies between expenditures, income, wealth and the joint distribution of income and wealth, with per capita emissions being more strongly associated with the joint distribution of income and wealth than with income alone. We also show that a significant share of households has both low income and low wealth, and may thus be lacking the means to prepare for a carbon-neutral future. Although increasing wealth taxation could provide much-needed revenues for low carbon investments, our results suggest that it would have a lower direct impact on the level of emissions and emission inequality compared to increasing taxes on high incomes.

Compared to non-optimal control (NOC) scenario in North China, the optimal control (OC) scenario implemented in various precursors in various regions not only resulted in less precursors mitigation (with emission reduction of 4.1%, 5.9%, 16.6%, 3.5%, and 4.5% for primary PM2.5, SO2, NOx, NH3, and VOCs, respectively), but also led to greater air quality improvements (with the number of PM2.5 heavy pollution days (HPDs) reduced by 37 days, achieving the goal of basically eliminate PM2.5 heavy pollution in North China).

The optimal carbon compensation unit cost ranges from 1539 to 6438 yuan/ton when the carbon reduction ratio ranges from 10% to 20%. Beijing would compensate Hebei 3.56 and 29.74 billion yuan for achieving 10% and 20% emission reduction, respectively. Similarly, Tianjin's compensation for Hebei would be 0.23 and 1.87 billion yuan in the two scenarios. Results further show that implementing the proposed carbon compensation mechanism can reduce total abatement cost by 43% and 84% in Jing-Jin-Ji under the two scenarios. The methods and results of this paper could help inform future carbon compensation implementation in China and other countries.

However, previous studies have focused on the nationwide industry level and overlooked the significant differences in the cement plants, remaining the risk of difficulties in implementing the proposed strategy. To overcome this problem, this study proposes a framework for plant-level green transformation strategy based on the industry-level emission mitigation pathway and a plant-level cement database. The strategy indicates the cement plants that need to be shut down, be retrofitted, and promote technologies. Results show that 1005 clinker and 3706 cement production plants should be shut down or retrofitted, while 60%+ of the plants should take denitrification and dust removal technologies in 2019–2035. The plant-level strategy can achieve energy conservation and CO2, SO2, NOx, and PM reductions by 40.0–79.9%, demonstrating the existence of the co-benefits. As only 4.1%–25.0% of the plants contribute half of the energy conservation and emission reduction effects, the plant-level strategy leads to significant spatial heterogeneity of the co-benefits. For example, the energy conservation and emission reduction potential in the five largest cement producer cities varies from over 30%. In addition, the total fixed investment is 99.6 billion Chinese Yuan (CNY) and the highest cost is 12.8 billion CNY/a, which will not cause heavy economic burdens to the industry. This study bridges the industrial-level planning and plant-level implementation of the green transformation strategy, whose methodology supports the synergic energy conservation and emission reduction in China's cement industry and beyond.

Government-driven urbanization and carbon emissions in China ";" The urbanization mode plays a crucial role in urban energy transformation and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the existing research on how government-driven urbanization (GDU) influences urban carbon emissions is relatively insufficient. By combining satellite imagery data and socio-economic data between 1999 and 2021, this research exploits China's city-county mergers (CCM) as a quasi-experiment trial to investigate the impact of GDU on carbon emissions based on the staggered difference-in-differences (DID) approach. This study indicates that GDU results in a 1.8% decrease in carbon emission intensity. The mechanism analysis shows that GDU reduces carbon emission intensity through population agglomeration, intensive land use, and industrial structure adjustment. Heterogeneity analysis shows that GDU's policy effect is influenced by the county's geographical location and socio-economic characteristics. The reform influence is more compelling in counties located on the administrative boundary, with less financial pressure or a better industrial foundation. In the future, policymakers need to nudge for urbanization appropriately according to specific scenarios and promote urban energy transition and carbon reduction.

However, there is still a research gap on the process of carbon flow at the farm scale in China and the mechanisms by which supporting land affects GHG emissions. In this study, we used an agri-environmental impact assessment framework created through an extensive farm survey based on a localized database. GHG emissions from livestock production were accounted for on a farm-by-farm basis. The impact pathways of GHGs were also analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results showed that the completed coupling farms (consuming agricultural waste and supplying fodder) were 2840 kg CO2e/$1000 USD, which was approximately 13.1% lower than those from incomplete coupling farms (consuming agricultural waste or supplying fodder) and 20.2% lower than those from non-coupling farms. GHG emissions are positively correlated with the pig–land ratio (R2 = 0.62, p < 0.001). Assuming that China's farms could be fully integrated by 2030, it could reduce GHG emissions by 12–22% of current levels, or about 45.5–84.5 million tons CO2e. Our findings provide new insights about expanding land to improve manure and feed management, which can help stakeholders develop strategies to reduce GHG emissions from livestock production, contributing to the achievement of sustainable agricultural development across China and globally.

To support decision-making, an accurate assessment of the potential contribution and the associated cost from the national perspective is urgently needed. This paper proposed a bottom-up approach based on a dynamic modelling to evaluate the potental of nationwide negative emissions. As heat supply is often prioritized by CHP plants, unchanged heat generation is a prerequisite of this study. Two operating modes (OMs) for the integration of CO2 capture are investigated, which can represent the upper and lower boundaries of CO2 capture: OM1 aims to maximize the amount of captured CO2, while electricity generation can be sacrificed; OM2 aims to maximize the amount of captured CO2, while the electricity generation is maintained unchanged. Sweden is employed as a case study. Results show that operating CO2 capture in OM1 can achieve 8.7 million ton CO2 nationwide negative emissions a year, while operating CO2 capture in OM2 can generate 4.3 million ton CO2 positive emissions a year, which represents a reduction of 6.3 million tonCO2 a year compared with the reference plant without CO2 capture. The levelized costs of CO2 avoided are 36.9 USD/tonCO2 and 52.0 USD/tonCO2 for OM1 and OM2, respectively. The biogenic fraction of waste has a significant influence on negative emissions. According to the Swedish climate goal about bioenergy with CO2 capture and storage (BECCS), to achieve 3 million ton negative CO2 emissions a year, the minimum biogenic fractions should be 32.8% and 84.3% for operating CO2 capture in OM1 and OM2, respectively; in contrast, to achieve 10 million ton negative emissions a year, biomass and waste-fired CHP plants have to operate CO2 capture in OM1 and the biogenic fraction needs to be over 59.9%.";"2024-08-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624023667";"3";"Emissions"

This study meticulously investigates the correlation and underlying mechanisms between industrial agglomeration and CO2 emissions, employing the fixed-effect model and regulatory-effect model across 283 cities from 2006 to 2019.The findings reveal the following: Firstly, specialized agglomeration exacerbates CO2 emissions, while diversified agglomeration substantially contributes to their reduction. Notably, the carbon reduction effect of industrial diversification is particularly pronounced in the southern region, carbon peak region, and industrial transfer region. Secondly, delving into mechanisms uncovers that specialized agglomeration's exacerbating effect stems from labor misallocation, whereas diversified agglomeration mitigates CO2 emissions by enhancing both labor and capital allocation. Thirdly, regarding spatial spillover effects, specialized agglomeration not only increases CO2 emissions locally but also elevates nearby emissions, whereas diverse agglomeration not only reduces local CO2 emissions but also radiates carbon reduction in adjacent areas. To fully realize the benefits of agglomeration in reducing carbon emissions and promoting regional development, the government should thus support diversified agglomeration, remove any barriers preventing the flow of production factors, and fortify interregional industrial division and cooperation.

The study examines the transmission effect of green innovation and the influence mechanism of multiple decision biases on policy combination effects using a combination of various policy tools. The results show that: Various policy tools and their implementation differences have distinct effects on the green innovation and environmental performance. In most cases, the synergistic policy mix effect, surpassing the impact of individual policies, is driven by the resource effect.

Accurate carbon price prediction can help us more effectively control carbon emissions and reduce environmental pollution. Due to the complexity of carbon valence, this study proposes an improved decomposition ensemble prediction model. Firstly, a novel signal decomposition algorithm is designed to adaptively determine the number of decomposition modes for carbon price sequences, obtaining a set of intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Secondly, a creative method for assessing the contribution of feature components is developed. It utilizes a genetic algorithm-based mutual-information method to calculate the contribution of each IMFs to the original sequence, classifying all feature components into high and low contribution components.

However, concerns persist about the accuracy of the data used to assess environmental impacts, as well as the extent to which these guidelines are followed in practice. Aim To compare dietary greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions estimates using different top-down and bottom-up life cycle assessment (LCA) databases; and to estimate GHG emissions of food consumption within the ranges set for meat and dairy in recently proposed environmentally sustainable diets. Methods Dietary GHG emissions were estimated for participants in the 2019–2021 Icelandic National Dietary Survey (n = 822) using three publicly available LCA databases from Denmark, the US, and France. GHG emissions among participants whose consumption was aligned with the EAT-Lancet diet, the 2021 Danish food-based dietary guidelines and the 2023 Nordic Nutrition Recommendations were also quantified. Results The mean dietary GHG emissions among participants were 6.3, 6.1, and 6.1 kg CO2-eq/day based on the Danish (top-down), US (bottom-up), and French (bottom-up) databases, respectively. The relative ranking of foods was also consistent across all three databases. For example, the relative contribution of total CO2-eq (% range for the three databases) was highest for red meat (39–51%), followed by dairy (10–17%) and beverages (9–13%). The contribution from plant-based foods (6–10%), seafood (4–11%), and poultry/eggs (<5%) was modest. The dietary habits of most participants (86%) were outside the ranges for meat and dairy consumption as set by the three sustainable diets. However, participants reporting consumption within the ranges for meat and dairy had mean GHG emissions ranging between 4.2 and 4.7 kg CO2-eq/day, depending on the diet. In comparison, the mean for participants not adhering to the sustainable diets was 7.7 kg CO2-eq/day. These results are higher than those reported in other Nordic and European studies, likely due to high consumption of lamb, beef, and dairy, and low consumption of plant-based food. Conclusion All three LCA databases provided similar estimates for total dietary GHG emissions and relative ranking of different food groups. Based on current dietary habits in Iceland, adherence to environmentally sustainable diets would lead to a substantial reduction in dietary GHG emissions.";"2024-08-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624023552";"4";"Emissions"

This study treats the 2016 green finance policy (GFP) as an external shock and employs the difference-in-differences (DID) approach to analyze the effect of GFP on the air pollutant emissions intensity of listed enterprises. The findings show that heavy-polluting enterprises have significantly reduced their air pollutant emissions intensity due to GFP. This reduction is achieved through improving energy efficiency rather than green innovation. Consequently, an energy rebound effect is triggered that partially offsets the energy savings achieved through improved energy efficiency. Furthermore, we have observed that the green innovations driven by GFP are of poor quality, and they neglect end-of-pipe treatment and clean energy use. As a result, these innovations are unable to achieve the intended emissions reduction. Finally, thanks to strict environmental regulations, non-state-owned firms have a more profound inclination towards embracing green transformation than state-owned firms, resulting in a greater impact of GFP on the former.

A temporal-spatial within-between decomposition analysis ";" The relationship between urbanisation and carbon emissions has been widely discussed. However, whether new-type urbanisation, which aims to achieve green development, helps reduce urban household carbon emissions (UHC), remains unclear. By expanding the temporal-spatial within-between refined Laspeyres index decomposition model with data from 236 Chinese cities from 2015 to 2021, this study investigated the differences in UHC between pilot and non-pilot cities under the new-type urbanisation pilot policy and further explored the drivers of these differences. The temporal decomposition results highlighted the changes and their drivers in UHC between pilot and non-pilot cities. UHC have increased in both types of cities, with the increase linked to higher urbanisation rates, greater carbon intensity, and rising incomes. However, the energy intensity and the urban-rural income gap effects helped curb the extent of the increase. Although a higher level of UHC existed in the pilot cities, the new-type urbanisation pilot policy helped narrow the gap in UHC between pilot and non-pilot cities, thus curbing UHC. The spatial decomposition results further explored the causes of the UHC gap between pilot and non-pilot cities. The within-between decomposition results suggested that, for pilot cities, those with higher UHC than the pilot-group average should close the gap with the group average, whereas those with lower UHC than the national average should close the gap with the national average.

However, an inappropriate matching can significantly diminish the environmental performance of ridesplitting. This study aims to propose a shared ride matching approach to low-carbon and electrified ridesplitting. Firstly, feasible ridesplitting trips within time constraints are identified and represented using a shareability network. Subsequently, the CO2 emission reduction of each feasible ridesplitting trip is calculated by comparing it with its corresponding single ride alternative. To maximize the total CO2 emission reduction from ridesplitting trips, an optimization model for shared ride matching is established and solved using a graph-theoretic algorithm. Additionally, a priority assignment policy is designed to preferentially assign available electric vehicles to feasible ridesplitting trips that have greater potential for emission reductions. Comparative experiments conducted in Chengdu, China show that the proposed approach can achieve higher levels of CO2 emission reduction without compromising service quality in ridesplitting operations. Furthermore, significant improvements in emission reductions can be achieved by implementing the priority assignment policy instead of a random assignment policy for electrified ridesplitting trips, particularly when electric vehicles are limited. Finally, the effects of maximum tolerable delay and electric vehicle penetration are further analyzed to provide valuable insights for the government and ridesourcing companies aiming to enhance both the economic and environmental benefits associated with ridesplitting.

Five different scenarios were set up to evaluate the energy saving and emission reduction potential of Henan Province from 2023 to 2050, by adopting four measures of accelerating the recycled aluminum, promoting energy efficiency technologies, expanding the scale of electrolytic cells, and increasing the share of renewable energy. The results showed that the production of alumina and primary aluminum decreased to 9.6 and 1.8 Mt respectively in 2050, while the future production of aluminum processing products and recycled aluminum showed a continuous upward trend. By 2050, production of recycled aluminum will increase to 14.0 Mt, expanding by about 5.7 times compared to 2022.

Pricing long run heterogeneity in carbon abatement costs across America ";" Electric vehicles (EVs) feature prominently in the United States' efforts to decarbonize the light-duty vehicle fleet and mitigate climate change. To spur EV adoption, public policy offers procurement incentives for individuals willing to purchase an EV instead of an internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV). How cost-effective are such policies? To what extent does their efficiency vary across states? We address these questions using state-level data on projected electric grid carbon intensity and fuel prices, as well as models of vehicle utilization. Our approach focuses on comparable vehicle models that enable us to jointly estimate the lifecycle emissions and total cost of ownership (TCO) associated with ICEVs, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), and EVs. Our findings are fourfold. First, although EVs offer the largest emissions benefit relative to ICEVs, there exists significant state-level heterogeneity. Compared to HEVs' emissions advantage of 20.54 tons of CO2e, EVs' emissions advantage ranges from 10.18 to 58.83 tons of CO2e across states. Second, HEVs offer a more favorable cost-to-emissions advantage nationwide, with an average cost of $59/ton CO2e reduced compared to $192/ton CO2e reduced via EVs. Third, state-level variation in fuel prices and grid carbon intensity enable HEVs to offer emissions reductions at a minimum cost of $3/ton CO2e reduced, while EVs' minimum cost is $76/ton CO2e reduced. Fourth, envisioned grid decarbonization efforts are insufficient for EVs to deliver economically efficient cost-to-emissions advantages due to EVs' relatively high TCO. If EVs produced zero emissions in totality, realizing cost-effective emissions reductions would still necessitate lowering their TCO by an average of at least $3200. We conclude that favorable abatement cost realization necessitates better targeting of procurement incentives at both the federal and state level. We demonstrate that this outcome can be achieved by incentivizing the adoption of HEVs and high-utilization EVs in the short run and by improving EVs’ cost and continuing to invest in EV battery longevity in the long run.

However, the current CPLB coupling considers only the relationship between livestock manure-N supply and crop-N demand, it could not reflect the greater mitigation potential through optimizing spatial distribution and structure of livestock. Here, we attempted to assess the CPLB coupling status in 2020 and its trajectory for 2030 to achieve multi-objectives: minimizing manure-N surplus, mitigating GHG emissions, and enhancing regional livestock product self-sufficiency, based on governmental nationwide survey data. The results indicated that: (1) The estimated cropland carrying capacity of breeding livestock for the years 2020 and 2030 were 0.52 and 0.55, but the associated manure-N surplus were 0.71 and 0.88 Tg, which indicated that there was a spatial mismatch between livestock and cropland. Therefore, it was necessary to optimize the distribution of livestock from a national perspective. (2) The optimal scenarios that allocated livestock breeding capacity across provinces based on crop-N demand (CND), food demand of residents (FDR) and GHG emissions mitigation requirement (GER) reduced manure-N surplus to 0 Tg, 1.29 Tg, and 0.88 Tg, and mitigated the GHG emissions by 1.49% (7.88 Tg), 6.80% (35.94 Tg), and 14.91% (78.78 Tg), respectively.

Among them, the role played by the technological progress bias of different elements is worth paying attention to. In addition, according to the current situation of energy consumption in China, based on the capital-labor technological progress bias, considering the introduction of the direction of technological progress of the energy factor plays a key role in analyzing the carbon productivity of China. This study utilizes panel regression to explore the paths and effects of capital-labor and factor-augmenting technological progress biases on carbon productivity. We also closely examine the regional heterogeneity and spatial spillover effects of technological progress biases. This study is based on inter-provincial panel information from China from 2006 to 2020. The study found that: (1) When the technological progress bias favors the capital factor among capital and labor, it will significantly increase the level of carbon productivity; The introduction of energy factor innovations,energy-enhanced technological progress, base on the technological progress bias of capital and labor will significantly reduce the level of carbon productivity. (2) Through the threshold model analysis, it is found that there is a nonlinear effect of technological progress bias on carbon productivity. Among them, in capital-biased and energy-enhanced provinces, the impact of capital-technology progress bias on carbon productivity shows an inverted “U"" trend of first increasing and then decreasing. (3) In capital-labor technological progress, when technological progress is biased toward capital, it will significantly increase carbon productivity in the Northeast, East and West regions, while the opposite is true in the Central region, and the spillover effect of capital-labor technological progress is not significant; energy-enhanced technological progress bias has a negative impact on carbon productivity in all four major regions, and there is a significant spillover effect in all four major regions.

Accurate monitoring of emissions in these enterprises is crucial for ensuring fair and trusted carbon trading. However, traditional monitoring methods have encountered various challenges including poor accuracy, low frequency, significant hysteresis and weak credibility. Addressing these concerns, this paper introduces a novel, multi-trusted, high-frequency monitoring approach for the measurement of both direct and indirect carbon emissions of enterprises, utilizing externally available multi-source big data, vertical federated long short-term memory network with a self-attention mechanism (VF-LSTMSA) and additive homomorphic encryption. The efficacy of this model is thoroughly assessed via case studies on six hourly datasets from the power and steel sectors. Our principal findings include: (1) In the current scenario, the proposed VF-LSTMSA model demonstrates superior federated efficiency, improving with the inclusion of more federated participants. (2) The VF-LSTMSA model surpasses other prevalent AI models, achieving a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of less than 9% across power and steel datasets. (3) The advanced high-frequency carbon emission monitoring method exhibits errors of +0.28%, +1.29%, and −0.41% in the current scenario monitoring task, suggesting that the model effectively leverages multi-source externally available big data to precisely monitor the target enterprise's carbon emissions while safeguarding multi-party data security.

The study on the pathway of reducing CO2 emissions and increasing carbon sequestration will help China better clarify the ways realize the goals of carbon peak and carbon neutrality as soon as possible. In this paper, the extended STIRPAT model and OLS regression were used to establish a prediction model to estimate the CO2 emissions during 2010–2060 under different scenarios. Meanwhile, the InVEST model was used to estimate the carbon sequestration, and the comparison with the CO2 emissions was analyzed. The results show that Qinghai and Yunnan have achieved the goal of carbon neutrality in 2010. Under the low-carbon and energy-saving scenario and the baseline scenario, all provinces within the study area are anticipated to attain their emissions peak by 2030 or earlier, and the CO2 emissions peak value of the whole study area is 3111 Mt and 3199 Mt, respectively. While under the high emissions scenario, only Chongqing and Qinghai will reach the emissions peak in 2030, and the whole study area will reach the emissions peak in 2040, with peak value of 3470 Mt. Under the three scenarios, the whole study area cannot achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. Only Sichuan and Hubei can achieve carbon neutrality in 2050 and 2060 under the low-carbon and energy-saving scenario. All provinces and municipalities in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are facing huge pressure of emissions reduction.

Nowadays, delivery enterprises do not only reduce operating costs, but also undertake a social responsibility: to reduce environmental costs caused by carbon emissions. This paper investigates the crowdsourcing framework to deliver urban parcels greenly by utilizing private cars that will be in passing. The bonus incentive strategy is introduced to improve the delivery willingness of private car drivers. Aiming at minimizing the sum of environmental costs caused by carbon emissions and enterprise costs, we establish a mixed-integer programming (MIP). To solve the problem, a hybrid genetic algorithm (GA) that combines adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS) and GA is proposed. The proposed approach is verified by standard instances. The results show that the green crowdsourcing framework with the participation of private cars will reduce the total costs. This approach has a great potential of reducing urban traffic growth and environmental pollution. Based on the real-word network in Dalian, the influences of the number of private cars, bonus incentive coefficient and time slack coefficient on the environmental costs and enterprise costs were investigated.

However, the policy design is challenged by the complex dynamics of global warming potentials (GWP) from upstream methane emissions, which have a short atmospheric lifetime but a high climate impact. In this study, we compared the life-cycle GWP of two propylene production routes in China: Coal-to-Olefin (CTO) and Propane Dehydrogenation (PDH). We also conducted a cost-profit analysis that incorporates the carbon tax, considering uncertainties in the dynamic radiative forcing of methane. We derived a range of optimal carbon tax rates that can enhance the economic competitiveness of low-carbon propylene routes PDH and discourage the expansion of coal-fed CTO propylene routes. Results show that, for the propylene sector in China, the carbon tax rate should be between 86 and 600 Chinese Yuan (CNY) or 12–84 US dollars (USD) per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), which corresponds to 1–10% of the typical propylene price in the Chinese market. Our study provides spatiotemporal insights into the carbon tax for China's propylene sector to decarbonize and control upstream methane emissions. Since propylene is one of the key raw materials for chemical (e.g., plastic) productions, our analysis contributes to the climate benefits of global chemical trade.

This paper proposes a tri-level multi-time scale energy management framework for the economic and low-carbon operation of URTNs with PV–RB hybrid energy storage systems (HESSs) based on multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL). A two-stage stochastic scheduling approach is developed to minimize daily operation and carbon trading costs at the upper level and correct day-ahead scheduling deviations against multi-source uncertainties at the middle level. A MADRL-based real-time energy management strategy is established to optimize the PV–RB power flow and promote its utilization by coordinating distributed HESSs at the lower level. The HESS control problem is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process and solved by a multi-agent control algorithm based on monotonic value function factorization. A Copula-based spatio-temporal dependency model is devised to characterize the PV, passenger flow, and traction load uncertainties and generate daily URTN operation scenarios for enhancing day-ahead and intraday decisions. Comparative studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in terms of a cost reduction by 11.98% and a PV–RB energy utilization improvement by 13.94%.

To ease the burdens of conducting sustainability studies, especially life cycle assessments (LCA), practitioners may consider integrating large language models (LLM) into LCAs. This emerging application may offer some advantages due to the capability of these models to generate and process text quickly and efficiently, decreasing the time it takes to complete an LCA and increasing the accessibility of LCAs. In this perspective, we assess the ability of LLMs to complete LCA tasks and encourage the LCA community to study the potential strategies for enhancing the integration of LLMs in LCA methodologies and collaborate to develop standards for responsible use. Because of these advantages, LLMs show promise for life cycle inventory data collection and interpreting the life cycle impact assessment. Challenges arise primarily from the inclusion of hallucinations in the content generated by the LLM, which can be mitigated if the LCA practitioner uses prompt engineering techniques. Moreover, the risk that models cannot take responsibility for generated content can be ameliorated by having the LCA practitioner carefully review the LLM output and take responsibility for decisions made based on the generated content. So long as appropriate steps are taken to overcome the challenges and risks of using of LLMs for LCA, the opportunities presented by integrating the generative AI models can streamline the LCA process and result in significant benefits for the LCA practitioner.

The impact of structural modifications, the introduction of iron-carbon materials on pollutant removal and GHG release from MFC-CW has not been systematically studied. In this study, four types of MFC-CWs were constructed, including MFC-CW with separated aerobic and anaerobic zones (SC), MFC-CW with unseparated aerobic and anaerobic zones (IC), SC added with iron-carbon (SFC), and IC added with iron-carbon (IFC). The aim was to investigate the effects of structural changes and electron shuttle additions on the GHG release. The results revealed that IFC simultaneously enhanced pollutant removal and GHG emissions reduction, compared to IC. However, no significant enhancements were observed in SC and SFC. The cumulative emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) in SC were reduced by 51.83% and 89.33% respectively, compared to IC. The modifications made to the structure of MFC-CWs influenced the relationship between functional bacteria (Chlorobium, Azospira, and Denitratisoma) and electrochemically active bacteria (EAB), resulting in increased values of nirS/nosZ and pmoA/mcrA. Comparing the SFC and IFC, despite an improvement in denitrogenation efficiency, the effect of structural alteration on N2O reduction was slight.

To support successful implementations of IECs, it is essential to understand not only the interaction of different technical assets within an IEC but also the corresponding regulation that determines the IEC's economic and ecological performance. Similar to different technical capabilities of available assets, companies of an IEC are typically affected by regulation in different, asymmetric ways. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the economic and ecologic effects stemming from asymmetric regulation, i.e., regulation that differs between different participating companies via a microgrid approach. By developing a novel linear model for German asymmetric grid charge regulation, we are able to optimize the economic operation of complex multi-energy microgrids under detailed regulatory conditions. In more detail, we formulate and implement a mixed-integer linear program to investigate the joint operation of a multi-energy IEC under asymmetric regulation. We conduct a real-world case study to evaluate the effects of German grid-charge regulation as a significant example of asymmetric regulation and compare the results of our IEC to a situation where every company of the IEC manages its assets individually. Our results indicate that IECs have the potential to significantly reduce the total operational energy costs under the current asymmetric German grid-charge regulation.

To more precisely evaluate vehicle emissions, this study aimed to explore the dynamic responses on life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of passenger cars in China, considering the change of energy mix. An energy mix-driven life cycle assessment model was established and inventory data were obtained. The electricity generation mix data in China were predicted, and the results in life cycle GHG emissions of internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV), battery electric vehicle (BEV) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) from 2020 to 2050 were analyzed.

We find that the embedded EU fossil fuel footprint has experienced a notable decline between 2000 and 2014, but at rates incompatible with 1.5 ° C . We identify trade patterns to be an important upward driver of the EU footprint through intermediate production, also thwarting the impact of the energy transition with effects from changes outside the EU lagging within EU developments. Addressing these outsourcing patterns to more fossil fuel intense production could reduce the EU footprint by almost 20%. We find that more than 50% of fossil fuels embedded in imports are linked to indirect imports. Thus, we argue for the EU Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism to include indirect imports, particularly of electricity.

Nevertheless, the lack of integrated on-farm CO2, CH4, and N2O flux measurements remains a barrier to including these systems in certification programs and the carbon (C) market. This systematic literature review critically examines field-measured GHG emission studies within climate-smart agri-systems in Brazil, aiming to: (i) integrate GHG-measured data, (ii) explore geographical representativeness and connections between organizations and authors, (iii) analyze distributions of studied GHG molecules, climate-smart system types, and productive components, (iv) conduct a meta-analysis on the adoption of climate-smart agriculture, and (v) identify methodological and scope gaps, providing insights for future research directions. The systems considered include no-till, well-managed pasture, integrated crop-livestock, and integration with trees (i.e., crop-forestry, livestock-forestry, crop-livestock-forestry, and multistrata agroforestry). Out of 1200 papers mentioning GHGs and climate-smart systems, 74 contained reliable on-farm flux measurements. Most authors were Brazilians affiliated with Embrapa and public Universities. Studies concentrated on the Atlantic Forest and Cerrado, with scarce data for other biomes. Over half of the trials assessed individual GHG molecules and only one climate-smart system. Urochloa spp. and Avena spp. were the most studied forage genera, while soybeans and corn dominated annual crops. Eucalyptus spp. and beef cattle were common trees and animals. No-till, integrated crop-livestock, and agricultural integrations involving trees showed soil C–CH4 influx from 0.8 to 1.0 kg ha−1 y−1. Transitioning from pasture monoculture to integrated systems decreased N–N2O emissions by up to 1.63 kg ha−1 y−1. Converting extensive grazed land to intensified-integrated systems reduced animal CH4 intensity, with cuts of up to 122 g CH4 per kg of average daily weight gain. Future research must urgently address methodological issues, such as de-standardization (e.g., 8–10 flux units found per GHG molecule) and the absence of crucial ancillary variables. In conclusion, adopting diversified climate-smart agri-systems shows potential to mitigate GHG emissions, but caution is advised when extrapolating our numerical findings due to limited data across Brazilian edaphoclimatic conditions. We urge scientists to prioritize frequent on-farm measurements of all three GHGs (CO2, N2O, and CH4) along with agroecosystem C sequestration across multiple climate-smart systems, enabling reliable and comparable net GHG flux calculations to identify the most sustainable option. Advancing and standardizing GHG measurements in Brazil offer an opportunity to enhance GHGs inventory accuracy, calibrate models, and promote policies and investments that expand refined tropical climate-smart agriculture.

In our previous work, a novel water-based CO2 capture (WCC) method based on adiabatic compressed air energy storage (A-CAES) was developed. This method is simple and environmentally friendly. However, unlike the widely used monoethanolamine (MEA)-based CO2 capture (MCC) technology, which consumes low-grade thermal energy, the WCC technology consumes high-grade electrical energy. Therefore, in this work, a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of the WCC technology is conducted and compared with the MCC technology from the perspective of carbon emission reduction. A universal economic assessment criterion of CO2 capture cost based on electricity prices is proposed, and the techno-economic analysis is based on the cost in 2022 USD ($). The result shows that the CO2 capture cost of the WCC system ranges from 53.74 to 71.70 $/tonne CO2 due to the different factors considered in computational models, taking 63.57%–84.81% of the MCC system under the same capture rate (85%). The dynamic payback period of the WCC system ranges from 7.14 years to 20.52 years, while the MCC system failed to recover capital throughout the entire lifecycle. Moreover, the CO2 capture cost of the WCC system can be reduced to below carbon tax (43 $/tonne CO2) when the CO2 concentration in the feed flue gas is above 18 vol%, achieving positive benefits with no carbon trading required, which means the WCC system can achieve positive profitability for higher CO2 concentration emission sectors.

It has become necessary to find alternative measures for South Africa to meet its climate targets without such a disruptive and aggressive transformation of its energy sector. To truly reach net-zero CO2 emissions, South Africa must ensure that residual emissions from its recalcitrant sectors are equally compensated by carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Given the potential for CDR technologies to delay the need for rapid emissions cuts, we leverage this characteristic to explore their role in helping South Africa achieve its climate targets on time, but through a less disruptive and overly aggressive pace of energy system decarbonization. Using an integrated assessment model, we show that while reaching its emission reduction targets, the presence of novel CDR (nCDR) approaches could significantly reduce South Africa's mitigation costs to $155-240/tCO2 instead of $190–590/tCO2 by 2050 in the absence of nCDR. Furthermore, the availability of nCDR may allow for a more gradual transition towards renewable and nuclear power generation compared to scenarios without nCDR. Importantly, we reveal that nCDR could help avoid asset stranding of up to 4–6 GW and $15–25 billion in associated costs between 2016 and 2050. However, this comes at the cost of higher residual greenhouse gas emissions due to the continued reliance on fossil fuels under nCDR availability. Overall, South Africa's priority must remain on decarbonization, especially in sectors where fuel switching and energy efficiency are feasible. Nonetheless, the complementary role of nCDR must not be underestimated, and South Africa should begin investing in these emerging technologies to support its ambitious climate goals.

The raw coals purchased from different mines have different compositions and affect the reactor/column parameters and the integration of the heat exchanger network (HEN). An integrated reactor-distillation column-HEN model is built for optimizing the coal-to-ethylene glycol (CTEG) process considering the variation of raw coal. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is used to solve this model and target the optimal raw coal for the CTEG process based on the interaction of MATLAB and Aspen Plus software. The influence of raw coal is obtained based on the sensitivity analysis performed for key reactor parameters and energy consumption. For the identified optimal raw coal, the mass fraction of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and ash are 84.02%, 6.80%, 1.00%, and 5.00%, respectively; the water added in the coal-water slurry is 62.15 t·h−1, and the water-gas ratio is 0.32, the corresponding energy consumption and the CO2 emission per unit product are 0.093 kgce⋅kmol−1 and 0.247 kgCO2⋅kmol−1, both decreased by 32.61%. The proposed method can be used to optimize the design and operation of the CTEG process and extended to optimize the other coal-based processes to achieve cleaner production.

Informing consumers can encourage them to choose more sustainable foods, dishes, or dietary styles. One opportunity for information transfer is through carbon footprint data. However, the impact of carbon footprint information or labels on food choices is rarely investigated in real-world settings, and findings remain inconclusive. This study aimed to understand how the carbon footprint on menus influences customers’ actual choices in various gastronomic settings. The carbon footprint of dishes was calculated and presented in different layouts on the menus of a university canteen, various company canteens, a restaurant, and a food truck. Sales figures were compared between an intervention period featuring carbon footprint information, and a control period with the same menu offerings but without such information. Customer perceptions were assessed by a survey. In the university canteen, the average carbon footprint of all chosen dishes decreased significantly by 1.5 percent during the intervention period. However, no significant difference was observed in the other participating facilities. A visualization of the carbon footprint showed no advantage over displaying the numbers alone. The survey revealed predominantly positive perceptions of the provided information among customers but also highlighted a general lack of knowledge about the climate impact of food choices. The results suggest that the effectiveness of carbon footprint information might depend on the gastronomic setting and its population. While many customers claimed that the information influenced their choices, this cannot be confirmed based on the sales figures. Further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of carbon footprint information in supporting consumers to make more sustainable food choices.";"2024-07-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624022212";"5";"Emissions"

Based on the micro-data of the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), this paper explores the relationship between mobile payment and carbon emissions from the consumption side. With the exogenous impact of Alipay's ""Collecting Five Blessings"" campaign, this paper finds that mobile payment significantly increases household consumption carbon emissions, but the marginal effect is gradually decreasing. Mechanism analysis shows that mobile payment mainly realizes the above impact through promoting the increase of consumption expenditure and upgrading of consumption structure. Further analysis indicates that carbon reduction policies introduced by the Chinese government in the personal consumption sector can mitigate the carbon emissions growth associated with mobile payments.

Rising atmospheric mercury (Hg) emissions are one of the severe environmental crises the country faces as a result of this fast-paced development. India is the second largest emitter of Hg in the world. Here, we study the domestic and foreign socioeconomic drivers of India's Hg emission increases over time. We find that the growing domestic per capita final demand level is the most important driver of India's Hg emissions increase, having been responsible for 88% of the total increase of 125 tons (t) during 2004–2017. In contrast, India's changing Hg emission intensity and economic structure contributed to a cumulative decrease in emissions, albeit to a much lower extent (about 22 t). Given the importance of socioeconomic drivers, there is an urgent need to account for them in India's Hg emission mitigation efforts. The Minamata Convention on Mercury currently targets reduced manufacture, trade and use of Hg, and its reduced environmental releases among others. It must also begin to incorporate considerations of evolving socioeconomic drivers such as increasing consumerism and changing economic structures.

However, the generation of N2O during ammonia combustion weakens ammonia’s carbon-free nature due to its GHG effect being 298 times greater than that of CO2. To enhance the combustion efficiency of ammonia and preserve its carbon-free characteristics, the N2O generation mechanism during ammonia combustion with low methanol blending ratios was investigated. A hybrid Perfectly Stirred Reactor-Plug Flow Reactor chemical reactor network was utilized, and the results indicate that N2O emissions are much higher under lean ammonia conditions (especially for Ф = 0.7–0.8) than under ammonia rich conditions (Ф = 1.1–1.2). Moreover, the equivalence ratio region achieving low emissions of NO, unburned NH3, and N2O simultaneously is found at Ф = 1.1–1.2. This region enables a reduction in GHG emissions by over 70% compared to pure methanol combustion. The production and consumption rates of N2O are controlled by the reaction NH + NON2O + H. At low equivalence ratios, the mole fraction of H decreases, causing a separation between production and consumption rate curves and resulting in significant emissions of N2O. Compared to pure ammonia combustion, the N2O emissions are reduced by low methanol blends of 2%–10% through different mechanisms during lean and rich combustion conditions, which are controlled by H and NH, respectively. Under lean conditions, the presence of methanol enhances the production of H, which promotes the decomposition of N2O. Under rich conditions, methanol reduces the formation of NH, thereby suppressing the generation of N2O. The obtained low GHG emission control region of ammonia/methanol combustion is expected to support the ammonia fuel application in the future.

Furthermore, it utilizes the all-factor non-radial directional distance function and the SBM-DEA model to gauge the green development efficiency of prefecture-level cities.

However, this industry is frequently linked to environmental issues, particularly its potential emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). This study attempts to estimate the carbon footprint of a palm oil company's operation for the year of 2030. In doing so, a novel methodology that consists of organizational lifecycle assessment (O-LCA), simple linear regression (SLR), and double exponential smoothing (DES) methods is proposed. O-LCA is used to identify the sources of emission and estimate the amount of the emission generated, while SLR and DES are used to forecast the sources. As the result, the carbon footprint in 2030 is estimated to be 62,758,433.56 kg Carbon Dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) where on average a ton of crude palm oil (CPO) produces 1.08 ton CO2eq. The study also discloses that the three largest emission sources are palm oil mill effluent (POME), fertilizer, and transportation. The forecasting methods used are quite accurate with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of less than 10%.

Nevertheless, the current challenges in hydrogen, characterized by its high cost and difficulties in storage and transportation, hinder its application in maritime technology. To address the issue, this study proposes a system that integrates a marine hydrogen compressed natural gas (HCNG) engine, a supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle (SCBC), and a solid oxide electrolysis cell (SOEC). In this system, SCBC is capable of recovering waste heat for electricity generation, while SOEC serves as an energy storage device to adjust engine load and enhance fuel economy.

The number of hydrogen refueling stations (HRSs) is increasing annually, and liquid hydrogen (LH2) is attracting attention as an alternative to overcome the transport and storage limitations of gaseous hydrogen (GH2). If LH2 is supplied to the market, the existing GH2-HRSs can potentially become obsolete because they are not as economically feasible compared with LH2-HRSs. Therefore, in this study, we proposed a new HRS system that integrates direct expansion cycle (DEC) and organic Rankine cycle (ORC) using LH2 cold energy to increase the utilization and economic feasibility of GH2-HRSs. The proposed design was validated through 4E (energy, exergy, economy, and environmental impact) analysis. Compared to the basic design, which did not include LH2 as cold energy, the specific energy consumption (SEC) and exergy efficiency of the proposed design improved by 38.6% and 9.8% to 0.81 kWh/kg H2 and 89.1%, respectively.

In this study, the influence of DPFs with different soot loadings on exhaust back pressure and particle emission characteristics, as well as the particle number emission, particle size distribution, and thermal field distribution characteristics during regeneration was investigated based on engine bench test. Results reveal that the exhaust back pressure increases linearly with the engine speed, as well as the soot loading. The increase of DPF soot loading leads to a considerable increase in the reduction efficiency of particle number (PN) and particulate matter emissions, especially for the accumulation mode particles. Moreover, the performance in reducing nucleation mode particles is markedly better than that of accumulation mode ones, and this effect is greatly influenced by the engine operating conditions. At the beginning of DPF regeneration, the PN concentration increases sharply, especially the nucleation mode particles. After regeneration, the PN emissions decrease by two orders of magnitude. During regeneration, the particle size distribution exhibits a unimodal distribution, with the peak value increasing considerably and shifting toward smaller particle sizes. After regeneration, the particle size of the PN peak value slightly decreases and markedly shifts toward larger sizes, the accumulation mode particle concentration increases by 7.2 times, and the nucleation mode particle concentration increases by 2.6 times.

To address this research gap, our study meticulously investigates the intricate details of the carbon footprint linked to Argan oil production within the ""Argan Biosphere Reserve"" in southern Morocco. This innovative research aims to deliver a comprehensive assessment of the carbon footprint within the Argan oil industry, conducting a thorough examination of 10 companies and 16 cooperatives actively involved in production. The foundation of this investigation rests on on-site interviews with leaders of production units, systematically gathering essential data for rigorous analysis. Employing the ""Bilan Carbone"" tool, we intricately calculated emissions, categorizing them into three scopes. The resulting carbon footprint outcomes were meticulously delineated across three distinct scenarios, shedding light on the nuanced dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions. In the first scenario, encompassing all scopes, including export-related emissions, companies displayed an average carbon footprint of approximately 10.17 kg CO2 eq.l−1, while cooperatives recorded 8.68 kg CO2 eq.l−1.

Delving deeper into the intricacies of emissions by scenario and oil-producing organizations, our findings underscore the substantial impact of electricity consumption on the overall carbon footprint of Argan oil. For companies, electricity consumption contributed between 10.84% (first scenario) and 66.97% (third scenario), while for cooperatives, the range was 26.97% (first scenario) to 75.57% (third scenario). To optimize the carbon footprint, our study recommends strategic interventions such as reducing electricity and butane consumption.

This study applies social network analysis (SNA) method and directed time-exponential random graph model(TERGM), while considering endogenous network structure variables, node variables and external network covariates, to analyze the Climate Change Mitigation Technology Innovation Cooperation Network (CCMTICN) formed in Chinese provinces, and analyzes the influencing factors and evolution of the CCMTICN from 2011 to 2021 using CCMT patent data from the Himmpat database. The results show that CCMTICN shows obvious core-edge structural characteristics; endogenous network structural variables have a non-negligible influence on the formation of the network, and other factors such as the information exchange network, industrialization level, knowledge level, and the degree of governmental intervention can promote the formation of CCMTICN; whereas, foreign direct investment, urbanization level, and carbon dioxide(CO2) emissions can inhibit the formation of CCMTICN. When considering the 11-year time effect of CCMTICN, it is found that the CCMT cooperative relationship between provinces remains relatively stable.

However, current research on real-time daily forecasts remains relatively scarce, often limited to annual predictions and point estimates. This paper proposes an innovative integrated model, based on quantile regression and Attention-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BILSTM), specifically designed for probabilistic prediction of daily carbon emissions. Testing the model on daily carbon emission data from major carbon-emitting countries including China, the United States, India, Russia, and Italy has demonstrated its superior performance across various metrics, including mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), coefficient of determination (R2), and normalized average width of prediction intervals (PINAW), compared to other benchmark models. This achievement not only highlights the model's effectiveness in predicting daily carbon emissions but also provides policymakers with a powerful tool for real-time monitoring and assessment of carbon emissions. Furthermore, the application of probabilistic forecasting methods enables decision-makers to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the potential range of future carbon emissions, providing strong support for the formulation of targeted policies.

It established a carbon emission system dynamics model, constructs five carbon emission systems, namely, economy, energy, population, land, and environment, and sets up four scenarios. Finally, in light of the scenario simulation's outcomes, we explored the optimal path and policy regulations for resource-based cities to reach carbon peaks. The study conclusions show the following: (1) All factors are exhibit correlated with each other, and their influence in the four scenarios is ranked as follows: GDP, energy consumption, industrial structure, total population, land-use structure. (2) Although GDP is a key factor influencing total carbon emissions, regulating only a single factor cannot achieve the carbon emission target. Thus, all factors need to be considered and synergistically regulated to achieve optimal carbon benefits. (3) Carbon emissions are higher and grow faster in the Baseline Development Scenario and the Fast Development Scenario, particularly in the FDS scenario, where they reach 614.48 million tons.

Additionally, the Petri-Tapio decoupling model was employed to analyze the relationship between ship carbon pollution emissions and per capita GDP. The study concluded that CO2 emissions from inland ships in the Yangtze River Basin increased from 2.418 million tons in 2007 to 10.801 million tons in 2022. In 2021, the emissions of NOx and SOx from inland ships in the Yangtze River Basin accounted for 2.27% and 0.0021%, respectively, of China's anthropogenic emissions. Despite a year-on-year increasing trend in ship emissions within the basin, significant reductions in PM and SO2 emissions were observed post-2018 due to the implementation of emission reduction policies. Furthermore, we found that economically developed areas such as Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang had higher emissions compared to other regions, with regional ship emissions positively correlating with the level of economic activity. Decoupling analysis results indicated that most provinces in the Yangtze River Basin have not effectively decoupled ship carbon pollution emissions from GDP growth.

However, it remains a challenge to accurately assess and map the spatial distribution of CO2 emissions and sinks. Previous studies have primarily focused on national and provincial level research, leaving city-level studies relatively overlooked. Acknowledging the significance of interregional differences and the crucial ecological and economic aspects of the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), we devised a research framework to analyse spatio-temporal patterns through city-level CO2 emissions and sinks. The city-level CO2 emissions were estimated using provincial data and linear allocation models, while CO2 sinks were estimated based on the areas of ecosystems and their corresponding sink coefficients. The analysis of YERB's spatio-temporal patterns focuses on regional hotspots, outliers, and time-series clustering. The findings show that: (1) Between 2010 and 2019, ecosystems within YREB absorbed approximately 41.17%–46.70% of CO2 emissions, with the increase rate of CO2 emissions being lower than that of sinks. (2) City-level CO2 in Western Region of YREB exhibited low emissions and high sinks, while Eastern Region showed high emissions and low sinks, and these characteristics were intensifying. (3) City-level CO2 emissions and sinks demonstrated a “core-periphery” clustering pattern. (4) The regional CO2 balance was predominantly driven by most cities in Eastern Region. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of CO2 emissions and sinks at the city level and offers valuable insights for developing regional collaborative emission reduction strategies in YREB.

The Carbon Emission of the building Materialization Process (CEMP) is the main source of CECI, originating from both the upstream sector and the construction industry itself. Researching the synergistic decarbonization potential and reduction pathways of the construction industry and upstream sectors can help guide sustainable development. Focusing on the city scale, this study establishes a bottom-up framework based on system dynamics and carbon intensity methods to explore the possibilities of CEMP. The framework comprises a dynamic material flow analysis module and a carbon emission accounting module. The Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method is employed to elucidate the emission reduction potentials of various factors. The results show that in the case of Hangzhou: (1) Without control measures, CEMP will reach a maximum of 25.1 million tons, and a substantial scale of 14.9 million tons remaining in 2060. (2) Through synergistic decarbonization, the cumulative emission reduction over the next 40 years could reach 323.4 million tons, and by 2060, CEMP could decrease to 3.7 million tons of CO2. Achieving carbon neutrality in the construction industry still requires carbon offsets from other sectors. (3) The decarbonization potential mainly comes from controlling the new construction area and carbon emission reduction in material production process, contributing 45.4% and 36.9%, respectively. This study reveals the significant pressure faced by the construction industry in achieving carbon neutrality. It also underscores that further controlling material demand and reducing the carbon intensity of materials is a prerequisite for Hangzhou's construction industry to achieve carbon neutrality.

This study focuses on the BRICS countries as the subject of inquiry, employing carbon emission-related data spanning the temporal range from 2000 to 2020. This study systematically assesses the interrelationships among variables using the Pearson correlation analysis and Granger causality test. Variables exhibiting pronounced correlation and causality, as discerned from the analytical outcomes, are subsequently identified and selected for further examination. Use the GCAM (Global Change Assessment Model) to simulate the Rcp-ref scenario (baseline scenario) and the Rcp2.6 scenario (assuming that the temperature will not rise by 2 °C), and compare the optimal paths of key variables in the two scenarios, and draw the following conclusions. (1) By the end of this century, the total carbon emissions of the BRICS countries under Rcp2.6 scenario will be 6139MTC less than those under Rcp-ref scenario. (2) Compared with the Rcp-ref scenario, in the Rcp2.6 scenario, the proportion of fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas, and coal in the main energy consumption significantly reduces, while the proportion of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and biomass increases. It is worth noting that the proportion of nuclear is significantly rising. (3) The demand for electricity increases significantly in the Rcp2.6 scenario.

Those reasons make crucial the examination of factors that accelerate road deterioration and those factors' negative impacts on societies. Climatic-related elements, especially temperature and precipitation, significantly affect the quality and lifespans of roads. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has reported that increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is causing changes in climate and that the rate of change has accelerated during the past several decades. To assess the impacts of changing climatic parameters on flexible-pavement performance, this study used 32 climate models to evaluate the performance of interstate, primary, and secondary roads across 11 diverse locations with varying traffic and climatic conditions. The study's findings reveal that changing climate exacerbates pavement distresses, leading to reduced pavement lifespans and increased numbers of reconstruction projects, which in turn raise demands for materials and equipment and contribute to higher GHG emissions. The effects of changing climate and changing climate's associated economic and environmental costs make the application of various engineering solutions to enhance pavement resilience essential, as described in this paper, in the absence of comprehensive emissions reduction strategies.

Accurate forecasting of CH4 emissions is important for identifying future sources of high CH4 emissions, rational design of experiments, and information gathering. This study presented a method to improve numerical weather prediction (NWP) outputs using the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) algorithm. In contrast to previous conventional correction methods, the XGB model greatly enhances the accuracy and stability of the NWP outputs. Short-term (1–3 d) CH4 forecasting models were built for 53 stations worldwide using three machine learning algorithms: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Random Forest (RF), and XGB. The models were validated with flux data from the stations. The results showed that the CNN model performed best in forecasting CH4 for all lead times (mean NRMSE = 0.34), followed by the RF model (mean NRMSE = 0.68) and the XGB model performed worst (mean NRMSE = 0.74). For land cover types (e.g., savanna (WSA) and forest (EBF)), the accuracy of the model may be greater for 2 d lead times than for 1 d lead times, which is closely related to the regional climate and terrain conditions. For lead times, the CNN model achieves high CH4 forecast accuracy at 1–2 d lead times. In addition, the RF and XGB models with 1 d lead times exhibit significant overestimation at most stations in North America (PBIAS>0.5). This work quantified the performance of machine learning models for correcting NWP outputs, providing a technical approach to the correction of NWP outputs; and assessed the performance of deep learning models for forecasting short-term CH4, providing a reference for model selection for CH4 forecasting.

The effect of green innovation with all its dimensions on environmental performance, is assessed in many studies which have obtained different results. An attempt is made to synthesize the obtained quantitative results through a meta-analysis approach to determine the overall effect of green innovation (GI), green product innovation (GPRI), and green process innovation (GPCI) on environmental performance (EP).

Exploring the green and low-carbon transformation of energy-intensive IPs is urgently required to achieve the dual strategies of “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality” and “Beautiful China”. Taking a typical energy-intensive industrial park (IP) in Henan Province—the Red Flag Cannel Industrial Park (RFCP) as the research object, an integrated evaluation framework including multi-objective optimization model alongside the synergistic mitigation potential of carbon and air pollutant emissions, was established in the energy-intensive IPs. Five scenarios were designed to quantify the GHG and air pollutant mitigation potential, while synergistic emission reduction control effects were evaluated under four measures of industrial structure adjustment, energy structure adjustment, energy efficiency improvement, and industrial symbiosis. The scenario analysis indicates that the integrated scenario (S4) shows the most significant emission reduction potential by 2030. Compared to the baseline scenario (S0), the GHG emission reduction is 11.66 Mt CO2eq (53% reduction rate), and the emission reduction rate of air pollutants ranges from 38% to 69% in S4. The findings indicate that industrial structure adjustment and energy structure adjustment are the primary measures for reducing GHG and air pollutants of IPs. Additionally, the evaluation of synergistic effect demonstrates that industrial structure adjustment shows the most significant synergistic effect on GHG and air pollutant by 2030. Finally, some policy recommendations regarding the transformation direction of energy-intensive IPs were proposed.

Wetlands are important sinks for MNPs, which can impact the ecological and environmental functions of wetland systems. However, the responses of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from wetlands to MNPs have rarely been evaluated. A multilevel meta-analysis was conducted to assess the effect of MNPs on GHG (CO2, CH4, and N2O) emissions from wetlands. The results showed that the presence of MNPs generally led to increases in GHG emissions from wetlands, especially N2O emissions. MNP type and exposure dose were the decisive factors influencing wetland GHG emissions, with CO2 and N2O emissions stimulated by biodegradable MNPs made of polylactic acid and by a high MNP dose of 1–2%, while polystyrene reduced CO2 and N2O emissions, and a low MNP dose of less than 0.5% increased CH4 emissions. CO2 emissions from the sediment of coastal wetlands were more sensitive to MNP pollution, while CH4 emissions from the sediment of freshwater wetlands were significantly increased by MNP pollution.

Additionally, clean environment is addressed by Sustainable Development Goals 7 and 12. This study evaluates the outcomes of meeting the OECD's carbon zero targets by 2050 as well as the UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties' 2030 carbon neutrality target. Therefore, evaluating how these factors affect the load capacity factor (LCF) may have pertinent ramifications for the government's pursuit of sustainable development objectives. Therefore, the effects of REN, NRP, and energy efficiency on LCF were examined for Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. The method of momentum quantile regression (MMQR) is applied during the period of 1990–2022. The results show that REN is increasing LCF by 0.157%–0.161% in four quantiles and NRP is also contributing to environmental quality by 0.385%–0.233% in 25th to 90th quantiles. EP is lowering LCF by 0.091%–0.073% in the long run. The paper provides policy implications for a cleaner environment in OECD nations.

Although research has shown that the production of materials can be influenced by local conditions, such as the energy mix, the impact of regionalization on embodied emissions from buildings has not yet been fully explored. In this paper, we investigate the impact of inventory regionalization on the life cycle assessment of buildings and its influence on greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction strategies. This is performed by first developing a consistent, automated and reproducible method for regionalizing the production process of building materials for all countries. We then apply life cycle assessment to a building for all European countries using the created regionalized processes. The results show strong deviations for certain countries, reaching a difference of up to 17% to the regional average data. When investigating the influence of regionalization on the choice of typical GHG reduction strategies, results show that the choice of strategy can be influenced by the regional context, supporting the need for greater geographic representativeness of building materials inventories for successful GHG emissions reduction pathways. Regionalization can also support the development of more accurate product-specific environmental product declarations (EPDs), which currently rely on average background data.";"2024-06-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624018821";"6";"Emissions"

Insights from emission duration curves and emission event duration curves analysis";"This research proposes and applies emission duration curves (EDCs) and emission event duration curves (EEDCs) in a novel way for comprehensive analysis of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in correlation with building energy consumption. Examining a 2018 high-rise building in Ottawa, we found a moderate Pearson correlation of 0.3 between hourly energy and GHG emissions, despite a significant p-value. This indicates that peak energy loads and emissions peaks do not necessarily align, underscoring the need for a new operational strategy. The EDC and Load Duration Curve (LDC) patterns further accentuated these differences, suggesting that electrical emissions are more concentrated in specific periods compared to electrical loads. For our case study, 12.04% of yearly GHG emissions occurred within just 1% of the year, contrasting with only 2.14% of the annual energy use. The study also highlighted the potential of a demand response event through a simulated voluntary outage during peak emission intervals as a viable GHG mitigation strategy. Collectively, these insights stress the importance of a comprehensive perspective on building operations, their interactions with the grid, and the necessity for tailored sustainable building management strategies moving forward.";"2024-06-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624018869";"0";"Emissions"

However, the often-overlooked aspect is the carbon emissions generated through trade activities, which can lead to an overestimation of decoupling progress. Our study quantified and compared the decoupling status of production-based and consumption-based carbon emissions from economic growth in Guangdong from 2002 to 2017 from the perspective of inter-provincial embodied carbon flow, and further investigated its driving factors. The results reveal that consumption-based carbon emissions consistently surpass production-based emissions, although they exhibited a steady decline in recent years. As a significant contributor to embodied carbon emissions, Guangdong outsources a considerable portion of its emissions to less developed regions such as Liaoning and Guangxi by importing raw or intermediate products with lower value-added raw, while it exports service products to provinces like Beijing and Zhejiang. Decoupling analysis indicated that Guangdong is progressively moving towards an optimal state of ""double decoupling"", where both production and consumption-based carbon emissions are decreasing. This represents a departure from the previous scenario of ""fake decoupling"", characterized by a reduction in production-based carbon emissions but persistently high consumption-based emissions. Additionally, our structural decomposition analysis highlights the potential for reducing carbon emissions and enhancing decoupling by increasing the utilization of clean energy and optimizing the trade input structure. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for embodied carbon emissions in decoupling studies and offer valuable insights for achieving high-quality development.

This study shows how ignoring the energy structure can lead to distorted policy recommendations as well as evaluation results. The present study provides a non-parametric estimating approach to quantify the difference between the optimal (theoretical) energy structure required to achieve sustainable development and the actual (observed) energy structure. This method may assess the energy transition process and evaluate the observed and optimal energy structure of a country or region. We demonstrate that using the countries of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development as an example, that only a limited number of countries are able to meet their objectives for carbon reduction and economic development simultaneously without transforming their energy structure. The relationship between energy structure and green total factor productivity (GTFP) was further studied using a two-stage least squares regression on the observed energy structure and GTFP.

This research constructed a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to examine the economic, environmental, social, and energy consequences of various policy combinations. Using data from the 2018 input-output table of China, we create 21 industry sectors and examine the combined impacts of different carbon policies. Our findings indicate that the effects of carbon emission reduction are more favorable when multiple carbon-neutral policies are implemented together, compared to the impact of a single policy. Among the various combinations of policies examined, the combination of feed-in tariff subsidy policy (FIT), renewable energy quota policy (RPS), carbon trading, carbon tax, and carbon capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) technology proves to be the most effective. The study predicts that by 2060, this combination of policies could lead to a reduction of 32.5% in carbon dioxide emissions. At the same time, it was discovered that a combination of lower-intensity renewable energy quotas, carbon trading, carbon taxes, and higher-intensity subsidies for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies, the synergy indicator θ exceeds 1, indicating a more stable economy; When the carbon tax policy is more robust, and the remaining three policies are more minor, carbon emissions fall the most and are the most ecologically beneficial. Imposing excessively high renewable energy quotas while maintaining the same level of technology and substitutability between fossil fuels and electric energy sources will result in economic instability afterward. Therefore, we suggest that to attain balanced growth of the environment, society, and economy, the government should increase the function of policy combinations and balance several objectives.

We use a System GMM dynamic panel model to assess how local government attention affects GTFP, with green technology innovation a the mediating variable and fiscal decentralization as the moderating variable, using data of Chinese cities from 2007 to 2020. The research findings demonstrate that local government attention can considerably increase GTFP in Chinese cities, with a significant time-lag effect, and the increase in GTFP in the time dimension is cumulative from year to year. The influence of local government attention on GTFP is heterogeneous among cities with different geographical locations, administrative levels, resource backgrounds and tourism development degrees. Local government attention can encourage green technology innovation, thus promoting GTFP. A moderating influence of fiscal decentralization is captured in the relationship between local government attention and GTFP.

Currently, leading industry sectors to ambitiously embrace technological innovations to decarbonize—consequently, in line with these changes, the significance of MSs should change; however, no previous studies have comprehensively presented the overall CO2 emissions and transport mode shares for future regional cargo transport. This paper presents a scenario analysis of CO2 emission reductions in the Japanese domestic hinterland of international maritime container transport based on future scenarios of technological innovation and change in shipper behavior. The simulation results using the global logistics intermodal network simulation model showed that up to 87% CO2 reduction is possible, and the primary driver for this is technological innovation. Moreover, the significance of MSs fluctuates depending on the advancement of technological innovation, suggesting that MSs hold a degree of import as a decarbonization measure during the transitional phase toward carbon neutrality (CN) as technological innovation advances.

This integration not only advances sustainable urban agriculture but also aligns with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) - Affordable and Clean Energy, and Sustainable Development Goal 11 (SDG11) - Sustainable Cities and Communities, through its energy-efficient, low-carbon approach. We hypothesize that this integration can significantly lower energy use in integrated RTGs (i-RTGs) and set out to validate this through dynamic models for both building and i-RTG climates, focusing on CO2 concentration, humidity, and temperature. Central to our approach is the implementation of a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) framework, which utilizes these dynamic models to make control decisions aimed at minimizing total control costs. This framework operates in a receding horizon procedure, regulating climate factors within the i-RTG and building using various actuators. We validate our approach by simulating an i-RTG atop a building in eleven different cities, demonstrating interactions such as energy, moisture, and CO2 exchange. Significantly, our study reveals that integrating i-RTG with buildings under the NMPC framework leads to a 15.2% reduction in control costs. Additionally, we find that the i-RTG model is adaptable to different climates, with colder regions showing greater cost reduction potential. Our study underscores the viability and advantages of integrating i-RTGs with buildings, offering a sustainable, decarbonizing solution for urban agriculture and building management that contributes to the fulfillment of SDG7 and SDG11.

The implementation of household-scale digesters in these regions is instrumental in achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 7 of ensuring clean and affordable energy. However, a rigorous quantification of the biogas production and net-greenhouse gas effect of these household digesters, taking into account fuel use, biogas leakage and fertiliser types, is lacking. This study quantified both biogas production and net-greenhouse gas emissions, utilizing Rwanda as a reference region. Through a field survey, biogas measurements, and model simulations, the study revealed that a reference case featuring a fixed dome digester of 4 m3, fed with manure of on average 2 cows produces 0.38 m3 biogas.d−1 which meets 65% of the cooking need of an average family of 4 adults and 2 children. The addition of a toilet to the household-scale digester increased the daily biogas production by 16%. Conversely, the use of a bare soil floor in the cow shed results in a 28% reduction in biogas production, emphasizing the recommendation for a concrete floor. Net-greenhouse gas emissions from a household-scale digester, including an estimated 9% leak percentage, result in a reduction of 2.4 tCO2,eq.year−1 per household compared to wood-only cooking. Besides, using the digestate as a fertiliser further enhances the reduction to a total of 2.5 tCO2,eq.year−1. The main opportunities for minimizing emissions include optimizing temperature, manure flow and reducing leakages, which needs to be considered during design, operation, and policy formulation.

For leather-making industry, the optimization of tanning process is crucial to fulfill the goal of low-carbon manufacturing. Artificial intelligence (AI) is an emerging technology for its ability to reduce errors, increase efficiency, and help realizing precise optimization of manufacturing processes. Herein, an AI-assisted method was first proposed to optimize chrome tanning process for energy-saving and carbon reduction. By comparing the performance of four machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., multiple linear regression (MLR), polynomial regression (PR), support vector regression (SVR), and backpropagation-artificial neural network (BP-ANN), it was found that machine learning models are superior in identifying the optimization of process parameters (pH and time) which lead to maintain key product quality indexes in the penetration procedure and binding procedure. Out of the four ML models, the BP-ANN algorithm and SVR algorithm are proven to have good predictive ability. Thus, we systematically optimized the chrome tanning process for energy saving, with key product quality as the constraints. The optimal process parameters, namely pickling pH of 2.86, penetration time of 90 min, pH after basifying of 4.08, and binding time of 90 min, were generated by solving the optimization models of the chrome tanning process via the genetic algorithm (GA) with powerful global optimization capability. Finally, it was validated that the optimized process was highly reliable by evaluating the wet blue product performances, such as the evenness of chrome distribution, thermal stability, surface reactivity, morphology, as well as physical and mechanical properties.

Air quality is measured using two novel regional air quality indicators (AQIs) for PM2.5 and PM10 estimated from weather observations and NASA satellite data on Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). Results from an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) analysis, based on a dynamic panel data model, show that forest fires and volcanic activity have significantly worsened regional air quality in Indonesia. The model also shows that the EKC hypothesis is rejected for Indonesia as cities have followed a monotonically increasing trend in air pollution with respect to economic growth. An additional 1% of economic growth increased long run pollution as measured by AQI PM2.5 and PM10 by 0.35% and 0.46%, and forest fire events by 0.11% and 0.06%. A partial Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) of forest fires shows that particulate matter pollution is excessive. Decreasing the frequency of forest fires by 1% would generate a net benefit of between US$17 million to 145 million. The lower estimate of the health benefits exceeds the agricultural benefits of forest fire without accounting for other non-market costs due to forest fires.

Second, the higher the per capita GDP of the region, the more significant the decrease in the total amount of pollutants, economic development is conducive to pollutant emission reduction. Third, the higher the proportion of thermal power in local energy, the more obvious the reduction of total pollutant emissions of thermal power enterprises, indicating that the implementation of ultra-low emission policies in these regions is more thorough. In addition, the environmental protection tax plays a positive role in the total emission reduction, and the higher the sulfur dioxide tax rate, the more significant the reduction of total pollutants of thermal power enterprises.

How will this affect regional carbon emissions? Based on the data on green finance and carbon emissions of 30 provinces in China from 2008 to 2019, this paper employs a multivariate linear regression model and a spatial econometric model to empirically study the impact of green finance on carbon emissions. The results find that (1) green finance significantly reduces provincial carbon emissions, specifically through promoting a cleaner energy structure and an advanced industrial structure, as well as improving the quality of green innovation. (2) Heterogeneity exists between regions. In eastern regions and areas characterized by high levels of marketization and minimal fiscal pressure, the role of green finance in promoting provincial carbon emission reduction is more pronounced. (3) Spatial econometric analysis found that green finance has a significant spatial spillover effect on carbon reduction in adjacent regions. Specifically, the flow of green resources and green ideas between provinces facilitates the formation of regional radiation, while green competition generates a siphon effect on neighboring regions. These findings provide some meaningful policy implications to achieve China's dual-carbon goal by promoting green finance.

The increasing needs of society also demand a significant enhancement in the manufacturing capacity to augment the situation. However, it's a stringent requirement of the hour to propose sustainable and clean manufacturing processes to realize the goal of carbon neutrality to support a healthy life on the earth. Specifically, the processes that are energy intensive like electric discharge machining (EDM) are of serious concern regarding sustainability viewpoint. The role of the said process cannot be essentially eliminated as advent of new materials of superior characteristics demand the application of EDM for accurate cutting of intricate profiles. Nevertheless, the commonly used oil-based dielectric (kerosene) in EDM releases aerosol, deposit particles, oxides of carbon (CO2 & CO), thus contributing to the environmental contamination. It is pertinent to mention that industries are compelled to tune their processes to achieve the goals of Net-Zero. Therefore, this study thoroughly investigates the potential of nano-graphene mixed rice bran oil to make the EDM process cleaner and sustainable which has never been investigated so far. Moreover, the process has been successfully modeled using artificial neural network (ANN) and optimized by non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (NSGA-II) which is another novel aspect of this study as it eradicates the need of extensive experimentation. Experimentation has been performed via Taguchi's experimental strategy followed by a detailed explanation of the findings based on process physics. In comparison to the traditional dielectric an improvement of 98.8% in material removal rate (MRR) and 93.9% reduction in specific energy consumption (SEC) are realized if the said novel combination is applied without compromising the quality. CO2 emissions determined for both rice bran oil and kerosene oil have revealed that rice bran oil provides 99.96% lesser CO2 emission in comparison to its counterpart.";"2024-06-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624019309";"8";"Emissions"

Given that, significant variables affecting carbon emissions from urban residential buildings (URBCE) at both macro and end-use building levels are identified in this study. Furthermore, an innovative dynamic simulation model is developed by integrating the Monte Carlo simulation model with the Kaya identity model, taking into account the uncertainties of the variables. Subsequently, the long-term evolution trajectories, potential emission peaks, and peak time of the URBCE close to 2060 in China's hot summer and cold winter (HSCW) zone are simulated. Results indicate that URBCE is expected to reach its peak of 272.43 Mt CO2 in 2040 under the baseline scenario. Through the dynamic simulation, the probable peak time of energy consumption in the HSCW zone is 2044 (±1.85), with a peak of 145.42 (±6.91) Mtce, and the possible peak time of carbon emissions is probably 2039 (±1.60), with a peak of 271.93 (±13.40) Mt CO2. According to dynamic sensitivity analysis, carbon emission factor, per capita residential space, and heating energy intensity can promote the peak size and timing.

Evidence from China's cross-border e-commerce pilot zones ";" In the context of global warming and dynamically evolving economic circumstances, improving carbon emissions efficiency (CEE) has significant practical importance for addressing the dual challenges of economic development and the environmental protection in China. Currently, digital trade (DT) is a pivotal force driving CEE improvement in China; however, limited literature has explored the interconnection between these two elements. In this study, the application of the cross-border e-commerce pilot zone (CEPZ) policy serves as a quasi-natural experiment to analyze the impact of DT on CEE. The article implements a difference-in-differences approach with a panel dataset of 283 Chinese cities from 2005 to 2021. The results suggest that DT significantly contributes to enhancing CEE; a finding remains sound following several robustness tests like varying the sample size, dependent variables, and sample structure. The impact mechanism analysis reveals that DT has the potential to enhance urban CEE indirectly by influencing green technology innovation, industry clustering, and energy mix optimization. Heterogeneity tests indicate that DT may be more effective in fostering CEE in the eastern region, high-level cities, and nonresource-rich cities. Additionally, a noteworthy spatial spillover of DT extends to cities in close proximity to the pilot areas. The study's findings underscore the vital role of DT in improving CEE, providing empirical evidence to substantiate advocacy for sustainable economic development and the achievement of carbon peak and neutrality targets.

Energy transition was the key to improve climate and pollution, and it was at a critical period. Previous studies mostly focused on the impact of climate policies on the reduction of air pollutants and the environmental health impacts of individual sector or pathway policies. Thus, focusing on the synergistic abatement of CO2 and air pollutants and health effects of energy transition in carbon neutrality was significant for building beautiful and healthy China. LEAP-HEA model was constructed to project energy demand, CO2 and air pollutants, and assess energy transition's environmental health effects from 2020 to 2060. LMDI model was adopted to decompose the abatement contribution. Synergistic assessment index was used to estimate the coordinated abatement effects. Cost-effectiveness of energy transition and regional heterogeneity of PM2.5 toxicity were not considered. The results indicated: (1) energy demand would decrease and structure would be optimized significantly under deep energy transition scenario. (2) Deep energy transition could promote earlier realization of carbon neutrality. It would contribute significantly to CO2 and air pollutants abatement with strong synergistic effects.

In the evaluation boundary, the methanation-generated exothermic heat and absorption-generated reboiler heat duty were integrated using low-pressure steam. The indexes, cost and CO2 emissions, of the whole evaluation boundary were evaluated based on the electricity demand, process water, natural gas, hydrogen, and MEA. Further, Pareto solutions were explored by combining machine learning and genetic algorithms. Notably, the bi-objective optimizations were implemented for the following two cases using different hydrogen prices and CO2 emission factors: the present baseline and target values in the U.S. national clean hydrogen strategy (Hydrogen Shot), and 21 and 12 Pareto solutions were obtained for the present baseline and the target of Hydrogen Shot, respectively. The expenses and CO2 emissions for the Hydrogen Shot target reduced by approximately 80% and 50%, respectively, compared with the present baseline. Thereafter, the impacts of the hydrogen price and CO2 emission factor, as well as the process simulation design variables, were analyzed. The analyses revealed that most of the evaluation indexes (cost and CO2 emissions) were derived from hydrogen; additionally, the methanation pressure and temperature significantly impacted the Pareto solutions.

However, most studies ignore the spatial nonstationary and nonlinear effects of urban landscape patterns on the PM1 concentration. In this study, a novel framework was developed that integrates a multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model and Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) machine learning method to explore the spatial heterogeneity effect, relative contribution and nonlinear impact of landscape patterns on the PM1 concentration at the national and urban agglomeration scales. The results indicated that urban landscape patterns were closely related to PM1 pollution and exhibited obvious spatial differences. The disorderly expansion of urban built-up areas and an irregular urban morphology could aggravate PM1 pollution, while urban fragmentation and connectivity could impose reducing effects. Dispersed urban landscape patterns could reduce the PM1 concentration in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Pearl River Delta (PRD), and Chengdu-Chongqing (CDCQ) regions, whereas compact and continuous landscape patterns positively affected PM1 pollution mitigation in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) and Guanzhong Plain (GZH) urban agglomerations. The impact of urban landscape patterns on PM1 pollution was greater in urban agglomerations than elsewhere. The ENN_MN landscape index exhibited the highest feature importance and interpretability. The threshold effects between the urban shape indicators and PM1 concentration were more complex than those with the other landscape indices. This critical knowledge provides a scientific basis for further understanding the correlation mechanism between PM1 pollution and the landscape pattern, urban sustainable planning and air pollution control.

However, the underlying mechanisms that drive this integration have not been fully explored. In an era marked by the urgent fight against climate change, understanding these mechanisms is crucial for creating a sustainable economic paradigm that aligns developmental goals with environmental commitments. This study uses data from 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2020 to construct a two-way fixed effects panel regression model that examines the relationship between ESG performance and carbon neutrality, while also addressing concerns about endogeneity. By incorporating a moderation effect model, the study explores the influence of green finance on this interconnectedness. Additionally, it employs grouped regression models to analyze the differing impacts across regions and industries, and conducts robustness checks across different time frames. The findings highlight the significant inhibitory impact of ESG performance on carbon emission intensity, which is further mitigated by the substantial moderating effect of advancing green finance. Further analysis of heterogeneity reveals that the central and western regions, as well as less industrialized provinces, exhibit a stronger suppressive effect of ESG performance on carbon intensity, which is additionally moderated by the presence of green finance.

This study conducted consequential life cycle assessments (CLCAs) of coal-fired power generation in the United States using policy-level accounting. Monoethanolamine (MEA)-based and Mg-MOF-74-based carbon capture have been introduced, with a comparative analysis conducted on the emissions reduction potential of these two materials through their respective mechanisms of absorption and adsorption. The results indicate that carbon capture based on MEA or Mg-MOF-74 can significantly reduce emissions from coal-fired power generation, decreasing from 779.5 Mt CO2e to 50.1 Mt CO2e and 61.1 Mt CO2e in 2050, respectively. The introduction of ultra-supercritical power plants and carbon capture reduced direct emissions from 92% to 51%. MEA outperforms Mg-MOF-74 slightly, with lower emissions due to solvents and cleaning processes. Deviations in Mg-MOF-74's adsorption capacity and degradation rate could lead to 4%–6% model outcome variations. It is also concluded that the stability of MEA's marginal emissions depends on a steady expansion of existing production capacity, while the marginal emissions of Mg-MOF-74 are anticipated to remain unchanged. This study emphasizes carbon capture's potential but stresses the need for prompt implementation and comprehensive assessments before deployment decisions.

With a capacity to process 1,500 tons of prunings daily, the biorefinery yields an annual production of around 12,000 tons of antioxidants (purity >60 %) and 78,000 tons of bioethanol. Utilizing a holistic approach involving process simulations and life cycle assessment, our analysis covers technical, economic, and environmental dimensions across two scenarios differing in design and heating source: natural gas or a BECCS system using olive prunings. Our findings reveal the potential for BECCS to drastically reduce the carbon footprint, potentially achieving net-negative emissions (−84.37 kg CO2eq per 1.00 kg of bioethanol and 0.15 kg antioxidants produced). However, these environmental gains are counterbalanced by economic and environmental challenges, with investment and operating costs nearly doubling and leading to complex environmental trade-offs related to eutrophication (+75 %), increased water consumption (+45 %), and expanded land use (+80 %).

To pursue the global goal of carbon neutrality, it is essential to strike a balance between traditional energy and clean energy. Thus, it is of great practical significance to forecast different energy production effectively. Firstly, this paper proposes a novel local grey forecasting model to predict different energy production. Energy production has fluctuated in the past few years due to government policies. Secondly, the novel local grey forecasting model focuses on each year’s production in the modeling process and uses a kernel function to measure the validity of the information. Meanwhile, different from other grey models, the dynamic model proposed makes it possible that there are no static parameters for the overall prediction. Then, the window width in the local model is determined using the particle swarm optimization algorithm. Furthermore, energy production prediction including traditional energy and clean energy production in total North America, Europe and Asia Pacific is conducted. Results show that the novel local grey model has satisfactory prediction accuracy compared with other models, whose MAPEs have controlled under 5% for different energy production. Finally, reasonable suggestions for energy production are proposed to meet various energy needs. ";"2024-05-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624017840";"3";"Emissions"

FedEx and ShopRunner have a unique combination of data that enables the simulation of e-commerce order delivery as well as passenger vehicle trips to brick-and-mortar locations. In this work, we study the potential distribution of CO 2 emissions for customer trips to retail locations and contrast this with the impact of individual e-commerce orders on CO 2 emissions for delivery routes. We do this by simulating the result of adding customers to delivery routes and also simulating likely customer routes to retailer locations. These two simulations allow us to directly compare the expected CO 2 emissions for both methods of shopping. The scope of this work is correspondingly limited to the trade-off in last mile delivery emissions resulting from the choice of online shopping or traveling to a retailer. This work contributes to the discussion of CO 2 emissions and commerce by simulating CO 2 emissions for last-mile carrier delivery or pickup by an individual. The research done in this study concludes that, when considering last-mile delivery or pickup only under the specific scenarios used for the study, having purchases delivered likely has a lower CO 2 impact than traveling to a store or location to pick up a product purchased online. In addition, survey results that were gathered as a part of this study indicate a consumer preference for environmentally friendly purchase options. We also show how this information can be estimated for presentation to customers during the checkout process in an understandable manner.

Counties as the basic governmental units for policy formulation and implementation remain largely unexplored in climate governance. This study makes an effort to fill in this gap by examining the dynamics and drivers of industrial carbon intensity (ICI) at the county level. Given the data limitations at both county and industrial levels, we develop a data-driven method that evaluates six commonly used machine learning algorithms to study county-level ICI accounted by statistical data. We find that energy consumption and labor scale are two consistent and significant drivers of ICI across all results, especially, energy consumption acts as the crucial driver. Accordingly, we divide the overall industrial sector into small and large sub-sectors to provide differentiated policy implications. Small sub-sectors with low energy and labor inputs prioritize production-driven ICI reduction strategies, because increasing energy consumption by introducing automated machinery leads to rapid economic growth and thereby negatively impacts ICI. For large sub-sectors with high energy and labor inputs, efficiency promotion through technological innovation is required for ICI reduction. As an example of scenario analysis, we show that an integrated intensity reduction scenario by reducing energy consumption and short-term increasing labor scale and industrial scale will make it possible for Manufacture of Furniture sub-sector in the studied county to achieve an ICI reduction of 68.7% by 2060 compared to the 2015 level. Overall, this study provides an integrated and generic framework for predicting ICI at the county level to overcome the context of data scarcity, laying a basis for making differentiated and applicable policies for ICI reduction at the sub-city level.

Chinese government is promoting a rural revitalization strategy towards 2050, but whether the development of rural industries and changes in farmers’ lifestyles will increase carbon emissions is a matter of concern. Here, this study obtained survey data from 322 villages of 27 provinces in China by face-to-face interviews, and the reliability of these data has been proven through T-test. Rural Human Development Index (RHDI) and rural carbon emissions have been evaluated, and “quadrant method” was conducted to clarify the relationship between RHDI and rural carbon emissions. Then, this study explored drivers of rural carbon emissions under the different kinds of villages. Results showed that the range of RHDI was 0.166–0.846, and 63.66% villages were at the low level. The average rural carbon emissions were up to 3.15E+03 t CO2 eq, and 28.26% villages were at the high level. However, villages with low RHDI and low carbon emissions accounted for the highest proportion (47.52%), and the increase of RHDI significantly caused more carbon emissions. 73.73% of carbon emissions came from people living, in which diesel of transportation and electricity were the main sources of rural carbon emissions, and the increase of population and area can significantly bring about more carbon emissions. Overall, the development level of Chinese rural area was relatively low, and the use of clean energy needs to be further optimized to arrive the goal of decoupling of economy and carbon emissions.

To address this research gap, this study theoretically analyzes the roles of collectivist culture and individual self-construal in the norm-sustainability relationship in the Asian context. Drawing on the value-basis theory and the competitive altruism hypothesis and employing cultural data from an Asian context with hierarchical regression analysis, empirical findings indicate that collectivist culture positively promotes pro-environmental behavior, with altruistic values and biospheric values mediating this positive relationship. At the same time, individual socioeconomic status positively moderates the norm-sustainability relationship. The theoretical contribution of this study lies in theoretically identifying collectivist culture as a deep-seated cultural factor triggering the norm-sustainability relationship in the Asian context. Examining the moderating role of self-construal in the norm-sustainability relationship sheds light on the reasons for the gap between individual pro-environmental behavioral intentions and actions in the Asian context. Lastly, this study provides a new cultural perspective for understanding the formation of biospheric values. Policy implications suggest a focus on the collective atmosphere of collectivism in Asia to stimulate individual environmental responsibility alongside the cultivation of rational environmental perspectives to balance participation across socioeconomic strata in societal and economic development.

";" As the largest energy consumer in the world, China maintains a tightly interconnected energy market in the international arena. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the interdependence and spillover effects between the carbon emissions trading markets, traditional energy markets in China, and International markets. We explore changes in risk in the Chinese energy market with the introduction of the Chinese carbon market by employing the Vine Copula function to construct a vine structure and analyse the complex interdependence among markets. Moreover, we utilise the Time-Varying Parameter Vector Auto Regression and Diebold-Yilmaz Spillover Index (TVP-VAR-DY) method to examine the dynamic spillover effects of risk across various markets. Empirical analyses reveal a strong interdependence between the carbon emissions trading market and the traditional energy market. The Brent crude oil market occupies a central position within the system and significantly influences other markets. The carbon emissions trading market on the periphery has little impact on the system. Additionally, significant volatility spillover effects—observed between the carbon emissions trading market and traditional energy market systems—are closely correlated with economic conditions and extreme events, demonstrating time-varying characteristics. Furthermore, the Chinese carbon emissions trading market effectively reduces risk spillover in traditional Chinese energy markets from international markets during periods of risk contagion, particularly during times of high volatility, which can offer policymakers a novel path for risk management and provide investors with new avenues for investment hedging strategies.

Large-scale CCS deployment necessitates a comprehensive source-sink matching analysis to offer early engineering guidance. To address this issue, this study conducted a source-sink matching analysis of China's steel sector, assessing CO2 sources, CO2 storage capacities and costs, and CO2 pipeline layouts under three capture targets. The findings reveal an obvious spatial mismatch between CO2 sources and potential CO2 sinks for China's steel sector. CO2 sources are mainly situated in eastern China, while main CO2 storage sites are located in western China. The average unit costs of CCS under low (30%), medium (60%), and full capture (90%) targets are 83, 91, and 118 $/t CO2, respectively. In particular, as capture target increases, the CO2 transportation cost will supersede the capture cost and dominate the average CCS unit cost, owing to the construction of longer pipelines. This study recommends prioritizing CCS demonstration with steel plants in regions having suitable CO2 storage basins nearby. Moreover, future investigations should concentrate on on-site experiments of CO2 storage basins and the technology development of offshore carbon storage in China.

Cleaner Growth Mitigation Measures (CG-MM) are practices and technologies which balance food production with greenhouse gas abatement and are also identified as being economically acceptable. This paper explores a large number of CG-MMs to assess their feasibility using a novel participatory filtering process. Each measure is explored through a series of mapping exercises with supply chain actors to identify the impact on greenhouse gases and their applicability to different farming systems. These are then refined in a series of farmer workshops to identify which measures were considered feasible. Results show that acceptance of CG-MMs by the industry and the farmers themselves is limited. A pessimistic estimate of 50–60% of potential abatement could be lost due to lack of acceptance of currently available CG-MMs within farming. This impacts expectations on decarbonisation trajectories for the agricultural sector to reach net zero by 2050.

Molecular dynamics simulations are employed to explore the wetting and condensation behavior of CO2 on nanostructured surfaces. The results indicate that the contact angle of CO2 droplets on nanostructured surfaces is greater than that on smooth surfaces. Increasing the pillar height (h) or solid fraction (f) induces the transition of CO2 droplets from the Wenzel to Cassie state, resulting in an increased contact angle. Nanostructured surfaces significantly enhance the nucleation rate, with molecules initially nucleating at the bottom of the pillars. A higher h or f accelerates the nucleation rate during the condensation. Droplets in the Wenzel state exhibit higher heat transfer efficiency than those in the Cassie state. Additionally, the formation of Cassie-state CO2 droplets undergoes a dewetting transition, altering the heat conduction mode. The dewetting behavior of CO2 droplets favors their detachment from the surface, potentially reducing the initial heat resistance. Therefore, appropriately increasing h and f can promote nucleation and droplet growth, enhancing dewetting transition and mass transfer performance. These simulation results hold great importance for inspiring the design of future CO2-phobic surfaces and guiding CO2 condensation production.

The novel contribution of this study is to provide the first application of a consequential carbon accounting approach, presented as a time-series analysis, to measure the system-wide change in emissions from CCUS linked to CO2-enhanced oil recovery. This method includes emissions from marginal oil production, a variable typically excluded in other LCA methods. The method was applied to a hypothetical CCUS project in Mexico to understand critical factors determining whether such an intervention can effectively contribute to emissions reduction in alignment with net-zero goals. Four intervention scenarios were assessed, comparing two distinct CO2 injection strategies in oil reservoirs (water alternating gas and continuous gas injection) and two energy policy scenarios (current and sustainability). The findings suggest that the energy grid's role in overall emissions is relatively minor, with only a ∼2% difference between the compared scenarios, in contrast, the injection strategy has a significant impact on emissions.

";" In 2019, the aviation sector emitted about five percent of the total energy-related carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions in the United States. The replacement of conventional aviation fuel with drop-in sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) derived from various biomass-based feedstocks is vital to reduce the overall CO2e emissions of the aviation sector. The SAF derived from Brassica carinata (carinata), an oilseed winter crop, could help the aviation sector mitigate CO2e emissions. Therefore, it is vital to develop a framework for assessing the eco-effectiveness of carinata in crop rotations by combining economic and environmental benefits. We identified 292 crop rotations (over a four-year rotation period with and without carinata) in South Georgia, a major agricultural region of the United States. We conducted a comprehensive life cycle assessment to determine the total carbon emissions of selected crop rotations. We combined the carbon emissions and profitability information using data envelopment analysis (DEA) to estimate the eco-efficiency score of each crop rotation. The results indicate that crop rotations with carinata emit less CO2e than crop rotations without it, especially when carinata replaces winter wheat. Carinata's profitability (net present value of $2996/acre) is highest in a “corn-corn-soybean” rotation at a contract price of $441 per metric ton. Finally, “cotton-carinata-cotton-fallow-soybean-fallow-cotton-carinata” is the most eco-efficient rotation at the same contract price. Overall, carinata increases eco-efficiency at the farm level and, thereby, has the potential to promote the bioeconomy in South Georgia and beyond.

Further, we observe no clear differences in climatic impacts according to the type of PSS model that is deployed. Rather, differences in climatic impact are influenced by factors such as production and design alongside use-phase impacts and contextual factors such as transportation and the energy mix.

This study aims to assess the feasibility of using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) as a point estimation measure and confidence interval (CI) as an interval estimation measure to quantify the uncertainty surrounding carbon emissions. To achieve this goal, the bootstrap and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods were used, utilizing both classical and Bayesian inference methods to uncover the true parameter value. In the context of Bayesian inference, a 2-chain MCMC method proved to be the optimal choice for generating posterior distributions and accurately estimating the true parameter of the distribution θ. The analysis also shows that, while a CI is valuable as an evaluative measure, it does not inherently provide a quantified form of uncertainty and should not be used for quantitative uncertainty assessment. Instead, the Relative Standard Error (RSE) emerges as a promising quantitative measure for capturing the uncertainty of θ, while the percentage uncertainty offers a qualitative perspective. These combined measures provide a comprehensive toolkit for computing and communicating the uncertainty in carbon emission and emission factor values.

This study employed meta-analysis and machine learning techniques to assess SGE responses to nine different farming practices in seven distinct agroecological regions. It aimed to identify optimal management strategies for balancing SGE and crop production within each region. Findings underscore substantial spatial heterogeneity in the effects of management practices on SGE, with the combined use of organic and inorganic fertilizers (MOF-MF) demonstrating the most pronounced variability (standard deviation, SD = 1.80), where MOF resulted in SGE 610% of that with MF in the Southern China (SC) region, yet only 54% in Northwestern China (NWC). Conversely, straw incorporation exhibited the most minor variability (SD = 0.27), influencing SGE by 35%–62%. Additionally, the study reveals that soil and climatic conditions significantly modulate SGE responses. In scenarios characterized by humid and warm climates with soil pH ranging from 5.5 to 8.5 or initial SOC ≤10, the environmental impact on SGE was marginal. However, in highly acidic or alkaline soils or with initial SOC >10, SGE responses varied markedly with management practices in arid and cold conditions.

Carbon emissions exacerbate climate change, leading to increased frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation, which may result in flooding. This study focuses on the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), a coastal city cluster in China, and adopts the scenario analysis approach to evaluate flood risks in the different carbon mitigation scenario from the perspectives of dangerousness, and adaption ability. The result shows that the Huizhou in the east of the GBA and the Zhaoqing in the northwest have the highest level of flood disaster risk. However, the central region of the GBA (Guangzhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, and Foshan) is very vulnerable to disaster-inducing environments and hazard-affected bodies, which means that the flooding risk and the impact of such risk in the GBA display regional differentiation characteristics and the spatial patterns of them are different. According to the carbon neutrality scenario, the flood risk in the GBA peaks in 2030, and decreases during 2030–2090. In contrast, under the uneven development and high carbon pathways, the risk peaks in 2060, and the overall risk by 2090 is roughly the same as that in 2060. In addition, the regions with the highest flood disaster risk are Guangzhou, Foshan, Dongguan and Zhongshan along the Pearl River estuary. Overall, it shows that areas with higher levels of urbanization and more developed economies will face higher flooding risks.

";" The success of global climate initiatives (SDG-13, COP28) heavily depends on the actions of major fossil fuels consuming countries, as their continued reliance on these energy sources greatly impedes progress towards global climate objectives. Transitioning from the dominance of fossil fuels to the expansion of renewable energy is crucial for ensuring Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and Conference on Parties (COP) objectives under UN climate change initiatives, as well as for achieving environmental sustainability. This study investigates the proactive role of renewable energy in enhancing environmental sustainability and evaluates the impact of fossil fuel consumption, real gross domestic product ( R G D P ), square of R G D P , and patents on carbon emissions in major fossil fuels consuming countries from 1990 to 2020 after considering and disregarding the EKC model. Two-way additive and interactive fixed effect models demonstrate a statistically significant negative effect of renewable energy on carbon emissions. A method of moments quantile regression endorses the asymmetric negative effects of renewable energy across different quantiles of CO2 emissions. According to the quantile regression, a low CO2 emitting country's environmental quality is largely sensitive to the consumption of renewable energy. Also, after considering heterogeneity, cross-sectional dependence and endogeneity issues, the effect of renewable energy remains unchanged. On the contrary, unlike renewable energy, fossil fuel consumption, real GDP, square of real GDP, and patents have positive effects in most cases, worsening environmental quality by increasing CO2 levels. Therefore, based on these findings, our study emphasizes pivotal policy implications aimed at fostering a better environment in major fossil fuels consuming countries.

Optimizing field management practices regionally can effectively promote carbon reduction and food security, given the varying SGE responses across agroecological regions. This study employed meta-analysis and machine learning techniques to assess SGE responses to nine different farming practices in seven distinct agroecological regions. It aimed to identify optimal management strategies for balancing SGE and crop production within each region. Findings underscore substantial spatial heterogeneity in the effects of management practices on SGE, with the combined use of organic and inorganic fertilizers (MOF-MF) demonstrating the most pronounced variability (standard deviation, SD = 1.80), where MOF resulted in SGE 610% of that with MF in the Southern China (SC) region, yet only 54% in Northwestern China (NWC). Conversely, straw incorporation exhibited the most minor variability (SD = 0.27), influencing SGE by 35%–62%. Additionally, the study reveals that soil and climatic conditions significantly modulate SGE responses. In scenarios characterized by humid and warm climates with soil pH ranging from 5.5 to 8.5 or initial SOC ≤10, the environmental impact on SGE was marginal. However, in highly acidic or alkaline soils or with initial SOC >10, SGE responses varied markedly with management practices in arid and cold conditions. The study further proposes agricultural management strategies to achieve the lowest SGE while maximizing crop yield. It recommends specific methods for fertilizer applications, straw management, irrigation, and tillage practices meticulously tailored to the unique conditions of each agroecological region. This research offers essential insights for agricultural stakeholders regarding cultivation strategies and delivers theoretical guidance for enhancing agricultural management and land-use planning throughout China's heterogeneous landscapes.

Then, influential factors are selected as non-market characteristics from the perspective of causality and incorporated into the risk warning model, and SMOTE and SMOTEENN are introduced to deal with the unbalanced samples. Results show that (1) The risk fluctuations of Beijing and Shenzhen carbon market are large, and the risk fluctuations of Guangdong carbon market are relatively smooth in the early period and larger in the recent period. (2) Air quality, average daily temperature, CSI 300, power coal, natural gas, European carbon market, exchange rate, and Baidu index are all important factors in the risk volatility of carbon market.

Carbon emissions exacerbate climate change, leading to increased frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation, which may result in flooding. This study focuses on the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), a coastal city cluster in China, and adopts the scenario analysis approach to evaluate flood risks in the different carbon mitigation scenario from the perspectives of dangerousness, and adaption ability. The result shows that the Huizhou in the east of the GBA and the Zhaoqing in the northwest have the highest level of flood disaster risk. However, the central region of the GBA (Guangzhou, Dongguan, Zhongshan, and Foshan) is very vulnerable to disaster-inducing environments and hazard-affected bodies, which means that the flooding risk and the impact of such risk in the GBA display regional differentiation characteristics and the spatial patterns of them are different. According to the carbon neutrality scenario, the flood risk in the GBA peaks in 2030, and decreases during 2030–2090. In contrast, under the uneven development and high carbon pathways, the risk peaks in 2060, and the overall risk by 2090 is roughly the same as that in 2060. In addition, the regions with the highest flood disaster risk are Guangzhou, Foshan, Dongguan and Zhongshan along the Pearl River estuary. Overall, it shows that areas with higher levels of urbanization and more developed economies will face higher flooding risks. The “dangerousness-adaption ability” structure can reflect the spatial distribution pattern of flood disaster risks, identify the priority areas for flood prevention and control, and is conducive to risk management. At the same time, the research results show that ecological protection have a positive effect on reducing flood risk.

Coordinating the relationship between economic growth and carbon emissions (EGCE) is crucial in realizing the carbon neutrality target. The Tapio model and decomposition models are used to assess the degree of decoupling within the Chinese chemical industry and identify pivotal factors impeding progress. The energy efficiency decomposition model explores the crux of failure to achieve strong decoupling. This framework further decomposed the energy intensity to uncover how technical efficiency, technological progress, and input substitution changes affect energy intensity and CO2 emission. The paper found that the EGCE of the chemical industry were stable in a weak decoupling mode from 2009 to 2019. The reliance on technological progress to reduce energy intensity and emissions is insufficient (accounting for only 18.2%), far below the cumulative contribution from economic growth (accounting for 57.76%), which has become the crux of the strong decoupling failure. Technological advancements drive energy substitution for labour, resulting in 244.41 Mt of cumulative carbon emissions.

In this paper, we investigated two innovative routes: the shaft furnace-induction furnace-basic oxygen furnace route (SF-IF-BOF) and shaft furnace-electric smelting furnace-basic oxygen furnace route (SF-ESF-BOF), alongside two traditional routes: the blast furnace-BOF route (BF-BOF) and SF-electric arc furnace route (SF-ESF). The analysis was based on a functional unit of 1000 kg of crude steel (CS). By establishing the mass and energy balance models and decision criteria, 12 typical smelting scenarios for these routes were analyzed and compared in terms of materials consumption and CE. The results showed that increasing the proportion of scrap was beneficial for reducing CE.

This paper attempts to determine and classify the peaking status of anthropogenic CH4 emissions in 188 economies over the period 1970–2021 using a trend analysis model and a decoupling model. Fifty-eight economies achieved a peak in total CH4 emissions, and 125 economies achieved a peak in CH4 emissions per capita, showing marked spatial-temporal variation. Emissions generated by the agricultural sector peaked in 84 economies, followed by the energy sector in 63 economies, and the waste sector in 34 economies. Of these, the most volatile was the peak in emissions in the energy sector. There were 45 benign peaking economies and 13 pseudo-peaking economies. The majority of developed economies showed strong decoupling after reaching their peaks. The agricultural sector had the most peak economies which achieved strong decoupling.

The results showed that high dose of boric acid (1425 mg/kg) simultaneously reduced carbon dioxide (16.4%), methane (97.0%), nitrous oxide (91.7%), and NH3 (27.1%) emissions in the composting process, resulting in the lowest carbon and nitrogen losses and global warming potential.

However, the higher costs associated with biomass feedstock, green hydrogen, and green electricity result in an elevated overall cost for this process. To investigate the relationship between economic costs and carbon emissions in the co-processing hydrocracking unit with coupled green hydrogen and green electricity, a multi-objective optimization model is introduced, targeting to minimize total cost and carbon emissions simultaneously. Three scenarios are proposed for better comparison under different objectives: the minimum cost scenario, minimum carbon emissions scenario, and trade-off scenario. The minimum cost scenario incurs a total cost of only 15,494.1 MRMB/y (million Renminbi per year, currency in China), but with a high emission of 5.95 Mt CO2/y. The minimum carbon emissions scenario results in costs and emissions of 20,421.9 MRMB/y and 4.97 Mt CO2/y, respectively. The trade-off scenario yields cost and carbon emission values of 15,580.9 MRMB/y and 5.76 Mt CO2/y. Furthermore, sensitivity analysis reveals that the co-processing ratio of bio-oil has the most substantial influence on the overall process. The proposed model and results provide a theoretical foundation for the design and optimization of the co-processing hydrocracking unit.

Pollution transmission networks are incorporated into the model via an adjacency matrix, detailing transmission paths of pollution across regions. Equilibrium strategies for emissions and investments in pollution control are obtained through a system of coupled differential equations. Our study demonstrates that these equilibrium strategies and the corresponding discounted net welfare of regions depend crucially on the structure of pollution transmission networks. The spectral properties of networks can effectively discern the evolutionary stability of equilibrium strategies. Through a numerical simulation of multiregional pollution dynamics, we also show that regions' motivation for pollution control decreases continuously as their influence in pollution transmission networks (i.e., network influence) increases; Nevertheless, an increase in a region's network influence can significantly reduce local pollution stocks in cycle networks but increase them in tree networks.

Exploring whether it is possible to reach the peak of carbon emissions earlier necessitates an urgent and imperative need for precise long-term forecasting of China's carbon emissions dynamics. However, the current carbon peaking predictions mostly depend on mechanical or mathematical models, which failed to consider the interdependence between carbon emissions and the time series-based patterns existed in carbon emission data. Therefore, this study presents a novel carbon peaking prediction method based on the data-driven rule-base model, which is implemented by the adaption of the extended belief rule base (EBRB) model for time series forecasting (TSF), and thus the proposed method is referred to as TSF-EBRB model. The TSF-EBRB model not only captures and measures the temporal correlations within the data throughout the processes of modeling and inference, but also consists of a novel parameter optimization model based on the temporal correlations. The study collected carbon emission data from 30 provinces in China for empirical analysis. It computed and predicted the carbon peaking trajectories of each province under three different scenarios from 2022 to 2030, validating the effectiveness and superiority of the TSF-EBRB model better than other existing carbon peaking prediction methods. The results indicated that, with policy interventions, the majority of provinces are projected to reach carbon peaking before 2030.

This study investigates the integration of Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units and renewable energy sources into utility systems in the context of diverse energy demands and low-carbon operations. A two-stage stochastic programming model (TSSP) is proposed for sustainable utility systems. The main objective of the model is to minimize the annual total cost and the other two objectives are to maximize renewable energy penetration rate and minimize grid net interaction level. The model tackles renewable energy sources’ uncertainty and evaluates environmental metrics by computing carbon emission costs. In TSSP, the first stage involves new equipment capacity planning. The second stage involves considering uncertainties related to wind speed and solar radiation. Monte Carlo simulations and probability density functions were used to generate a variety of scenarios for the optimization of operational scheduling decisions. Finally, a case study was conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Compared to traditional deterministic optimization in utility systems, the two-stage stochastic programming of sustainable utility systems can reduce carbon emissions by 5.6 percent annually and overall costs by 8,907,733 CNY. It provides decision-makers with a range of reference options by balancing multiple objectives, including economic factors, renewable energy penetration rate, and grid interaction level.

To address these challenges, a novel Integrated Electric-Gas Dispatch (IEGD) model is introduced in this paper. Firstly, the Box-Jenkins-based NGPN rapid transient flow model is proposed. Secondly, an IEGD model with optimization targets focusing on IEGS cost and NGSs revenue is introduced. Finally, the proposed natural gas flow model is validated through its application to an inter-provincial natural gas pipeline network and a regional-level network in China's central and western regions. A comparison with commercial software indicates that the proposed model offers additional advantages, with a total relative average error of 0.57% and 0.36%, respectively, and a computation speed of 62.3 times and 72.4 faster. When the IEGD model is applied to an IEGS, promising outcomes are revealed by two distinct scenarios: carbon emissions within the IEGS can be reduced by as much as 32.64% per day, considering carbon taxes. Furthermore, through intensifying the collaborative integration of gas and electricity systems, overall carbon emissions can be lowered by up to 48.19%, and NGSs revenue can be boosted by as much as 11.2%.

NH3 emissions from croplands are influenced not only by natural factors but also by human management practices and social factors. However, our current understanding of the mechanisms and driving factors behind these emissions is limited. In this study, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the factors influencing NH3 emissions using data from in-situ experiments and historical emissions data from 1980 to 2020. Our analysis revealed that fertilization management is the most significant contributor, accounting for 47% of NH3 emission flux at the point level. Climate conditions and soil properties contribute 21% and 32%, respectively, to cropland NH3 flux. At the county level, the contributions of management practices and socioeconomic factors such as farm size to NH3 emission factors are nearly equal, with proportions of 51% and 49%, respectively. Advancements in agricultural mechanization and practices focused on reducing fertilizer use can achieve a 29% reduction in NH3 emissions by 2030, all while maintaining rapid socioeconomic development. This highlights a strategy that can improve environmental quality, ensure Chinese grain production security, and deliver significant socioeconomic and ecological benefits.

However, there is limited understanding of how genetic traits affect GHG emissions from the dairy production chain and how breeding indices could be used to find a balance between GHG emissions and farm profit. Using a typical Chinese dairy farm as a case study, we developed a novel method to address these gaps. The farm comprised of 1523 Holstein-Friesian dairy cows and 1429 young stock. The average milk yield at the farm was 11,533 kg per cow per year. Life cycle assessment was combined with an existing bio-economic model to determine the emission intensity values (IV) of six genetic traits: milk yield, protein yield, fat yield, calving interval, productive life, and incidence of clinical mastitis. The IVs and economic values of the traits were used to form different breeding indices, of which the economic and environmental consequences were assessed. Results showed that for the next generation, breeding animals with optimal indices could reduce carbon dioxide equivalents per ton of fat-and-protein-corrected milk by six to 10 kg, while increasing profitability by 822 to 1355 Chinese Yuan per cow unit. Different indices can balance farm profit and GHG emissions to different degrees. However, the indices with higher profit showed less potential in reducing GHG emissions. This study provides insights into how breeding strategies could contribute to GHG mitigation in the dairy sector.

This study used the indicator of carbon emission intensity to evaluate the reduction effect of carbon emission of heavy-polluted regions and sectors, and also their features in China. The results indicated firstly, the aggregated carbon emission intensity of regions was primarily influenced by their embodied added value. From 2012 to 2015, the regions’ embodied added value increased more than 2 times. Secondly, the embodied carbon emission of the manufacture of chemical products sectors in regions were dominated by emission implied in metabolic path length greater than five, which took the proportion of more than 30% of emission. This showed that emission reduction policies for heavy-polluted sectors should focus on controlling the emission implied in trading with downstream sectors, and also demonstrated that the heavy-polluted sectors drove the reduction of carbon emission of other sectors. Thirdly, the carbon emission of heavy-polluted sectors in coastal regions fell due to implementing the carbon emission trading scheme policy, while heavy-polluted sectors in the inland regions radiated to their upstream and downstream sectors.

In China, Eco-industrial parks (EIPs) are one of the platforms for achieving energy conservation and emission reduction. This study aims to investigate the future CO2 emissions reduction potential by evaluating two different types of national EIPs in China. Firstly, we constructed carbon emission inventories for EIP-N in Zhejiang Province and EIP-L in Shandong Province. Subsequently, leveraging these inventories, we developed an integrated model aimed at predicting the carbon emission peaks for both EIPs and discerning the main contributors. Secondly, we took EIP-N and EIP-L as examples and applied the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) model to establish three different scenarios for analyzing the future trends in carbon emissions. In a Business as usual (BAU) scenario (continue the current energy conservation and emission reduction policies), EIP-L can achieve carbon peaking, while the carbon emissions of EIP-N will continue to increase. In the Emissions control (EMC) scenario (considering the reduction of fossil fuels and the increased use of cleaner energy sources), EIP-N and EIP-L are projected to peak in 2029 and 2027, respectively. In the Reinforce mitigation (RFM) scenario (with fewer emissions from fuels and a higher share of clean energy generation), both EIPs are expected to achieve carbon peaking by 2025. Finally, we proposed the deep decarbonization of EIPs with different industrial characteristics. This study applied the LEAP model to the EIP scale, explored the paths of deep decarbonization development in different EIPs under the constraint of dual-carbon targets, providing a demonstration for China and other developing countries to achieve the goal of carbon capping in EIPs during rapid industrialization.

This study investigated a new coopetitive mode in a sustainable supply chain with EPC and supplier encroachment. The supplier may provide an EPC service to curb carbon emissions for the downstream manufacturer and obtain a partial savings in carbon costs by bearing the entire cost of the EPC investment. However, the supplier is motivated to develop a new direct selling channel that engages in Cournot competition with the manufacturer in the final market. The consumer acceptance of a new encroaching channel and the unit incompatibility cost of EPC are two critical factors in supplier and manufacturer decisions. The results demonstrate that the lower the consumer acceptance of a new encroaching channel, the more radical the decision that will be made by the supplier to abate emissions after encroachment to reduce the manufacturer's emissions cost. Moreover, in contrast to the traditional result, encroachment might cause the supplier to charge a higher wholesale price when implementing EPC services.

This paper applied the calculation method before and after improvement to Henan Polytechnic University. The EF of the campus according to calculations was 28,358.41 gha, and the per capita EF was 0.657 gha/person using the improved calculation method.

The goal of this study was to develop models that could forecast how well water-based nanofluids would absorb CO2. Several machine learning models, such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and K-Nearest Neighbors, underwent training using a total of 1306 experimental datasets. These datasets contained information on the CO2 solubility in aqueous solutions for different types of nanoparticles. In terms of Average Absolute Relative Deviation (AARD%), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Relative Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, and Correlation Coefficient, the predictive performance on separate test data was assessed. The XGBoost model demonstrates a higher degree of accuracy in simulating the absorption capacity of aqueous nanofluid compared to other models. This is evident through the AARD value of 2.8%, MSE of 0.00084, MAE of 0.012 and an R value of 0.992. The research provides insight into the utilization of different machine learning algorithms for simulating the absorption of CO2 by nanofluids. By employing accurate data-driven models, the efficiency of nanofluid-based CO2 capture processes can be enhanced through improvements in their design and operating conditions.

The study on the ethanol life cycle showed hydrous ethanol with 10%–20% water content had the best benefit, but the water content >10% would deteriorate engine power and emission performance. In this paper, the effects of the 30 vol% laboratory-grade H2O2 on the combustion performance and emission characteristics were explored in an ethanol/gasoline combined injection engine. At the engine operating condition of engine speed/manifold air pressure = 1500 rpm/49.5 kPa, the H2O2-ethanol blend direct injection (DI) and gasoline port injection were conducted. Results showed that H2O2 greatly improved the operating performance of the hydrous ethanol/gasoline engine. As the 30 vol%-H2O2 ratio in the H2O2-ethanol blend (H2O2r) increased, the Pmax and the Tmax first increased and then decreased. Both CA0-10 and CA10-90 were slightly extended. For the DI ratio = 10%–40%, the optimal IMEP was obtained at H2O2r = 15%, which was 0.09 bar–0.11 bar higher than H2O2r = 0%. The optimal BTE was 0.86%, 0.75%, 0.71% and 0.75% higher than H2O2r = 0%, respectively. As the H2O2r and DI ratio increased, HC and NOx emissions descended, and CO emissions decreased first and then ascended slightly with the critical H2O2r = 10%–15%. Optimal CO, HC and NOx emissions were 21.76%, 58.83% and 42.02% lower than gasoline, respectively. H2O2 could reduce particulate emissions, while the H2O2r < 15% at the DI ratio = 30%–40% should be adopted.

China announced their plan to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and to reach carbon neutrality by 2060, which faces many challenges including rising energy consumption and a significant, ongoing expansion of coal-based electricity generation capacity. This study employs mixed methods to explore a portfolio of climate policies related to the transport and energy sectors for two leading Chinese cities: Beijing and Hong Kong. A total of 32 expert interviews were conducted with four stakeholder groups in both cities to canvas opinions on the most important policies for decarbonization. With the aim to understand how local policy measures can be prioritized for disproportionately large emissions reductions, the Sensitive Intervention Points (SIPs) framework was applied to identify city-level policy interventions with the potential for high impact, speed, feasibility, persistence, and low risk, based on these expert interviews and literature review. With all attributes combined, leveraging the global cost declines in renewable energy was identified as a shared accelerated carbon neutrality pathway for both cities, facilitated by policies to promote the import of low-carbon energy and accelerating the electrification of transport. Alignments were found between this final list of SIPs and policies perceived as important by the experts, indicating that SIPs are generally intuitive, with alternative policy prioritizations likely influenced by additional factors such as the national agenda, budgetary constraints, and the availability of co-benefits.";"2024-04-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624011296";"2";"Emissions"

Zhengzhou, recognized as one of the China's ""National Central Cities"", has a high energy demand. Its power sector, which is primarily reliant on coal, is responsible for half of the city's CO2 emissions. The low emissions analysis platform (LEAP) model serves as an effective tool for exploring the power sector's transition to low-carbon sources. However, studies on the combined reduction in air pollutants and CO2 at the city level are scarce. This study focuses on Zhengzhou's power sector, examining the power composition, coal usage, CO2 and air pollutant emissions, social costs, and employment effects across five scenarios using LEAP. The five scenarios are the business-as-usual scenario, the reference scenario, the carbon neutrality scenario, and two optimization scenarios with different carbon peak and carbon neutrality time. CO2 emissions will peak in 2030 at 34.6 Mt in the reference scenario, and in 2022 at 32.4 Mt in the carbon neutrality scenario. Emissions in the reference and carbon neutrality scenarios will decrease by 64.8% and 75.2%, respectively, from those in the business-as-usual scenario due to emission reduction strategies. In the carbon neutrality scenario, coal power reformation is the most significant measure, accounting for 45.7% of the total CO2 reduction compared to that in the business-as-usual scenario, followed by the integration of external electricity (17.8%) and solar energy (13.6%). This scenario also demonstrated a strong synergistic effect on reducing air pollutants and CO2 emissions. Although the carbon neutrality scenario incurs costs 60.4 billion yuan higher than those of the reference scenario, its CO2 mitigation cost is 66.1 yuan/t lower. This indicated that more rapid CO2 reduction, despite higher economic inputs, is justified by ambitious CO2 reduction goals and environmental benefits. Enhancing the use of renewable energy technologies for research and development to lower costs could increase the economic feasibility of the carbon neutrality scenario. In the two optimization scenarios, complete elimination of CO2 and air pollutant emissions is achieved by 2060, with all the electricity generated from renewable sources, although issues of uncertainty and stability need to be addressed. The study also highlights that renewable energy development will significantly boost employment, with an estimated 1.19 million jobs in 2060 in the carbon neutrality scenario. Finally, the paper concludes with a sensitivity analysis and offers policy recommendations for the power sector's low-carbon transition.

Environmental policy across Canadian provinces has largely lacked consistency with some provinces implementing targeted policy such as carbon taxes while others have strongly resisted the federal government's attempts to encourage such policy. This study examines the impact of environmental policy on GHG gas emissions across Canadian provinces with policy uniquely measured by public and business sector spending on environmental protection as well as notable province-specific policies. An extended STIRPAT model is specified with the inclusion of proxies for environmental policy using panel data from Canada's ten provinces from 1995 to 2019. The cointegration and the error correction modelling approaches are employed to estimate the non-stationary panel data. A pooled mean group estimation is applied to provide short run and long run coefficients. The findings indicate that although per capita GDP is the main driver of GHG emissions in Canada, environmental policy has a significant mitigating effect, as shown by the negative association between emissions and private and public sector spending on environmental protection in the long run. Furthermore, provinces with targeted policies, such as Ontario's coal phase-out and British Columbia's carbon tax, experienced significant emissions reductions. The theoretical implication is the successful addition of policy variables to the STIRPAT model, providing the model a new application for future research.";"2024-04-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624013167";"19";"Emissions"

Farmer cooperatives have widely been viewed as an important agricultural organization to enhance production scale and technological capabilities. This study aims to explore how farmer cooperatives influence agricultural carbon emissions, contributing to the achievement of dual carbon goals. Using Chinese county-level panel data during the period between 2013 and 2017, this study employs ordinary least-squares to examine the impact of farmer cooperatives, particularly regulated cooperatives, on agricultural carbon emissions. The results show that farmer cooperatives, particularly regulated cooperatives have significantly negative influence on agricultural carbon emissions and the effects are heterogeneous across the level of agricultural carbon emissions and the agricultural economy. Specifically, the farmer cooperatives effect tends to be bigger for regions with high-level agricultural carbon emissions and primary industry of high-level value-added. Additionally, mechanism analysis reveals that farmer cooperatives contribute to emission reduction by decreasing fertilizer input. These findings are crucial for promoting the development of farmer cooperatives, especially regulated ones, in achieving carbon peak and neutrality goals. This study fills a research gap in the role of agricultural cooperatives in carbon mitigation and offers a novel perspective for cooperative development and agriculture-based carbon mitigation strategies.

However, there remains a gap in the understanding the extent and mechanisms through which the establishment of economic growth targets influences firms' pollution emissions. Addressing this gap, we construct datasets that encapsulate both micro-level and macro-level perspectives to examine the impact of economic growth targets on corporate pollution. We find that an increase in economic growth targets leads to a significant rise in pollution emissions from industrial firms. To address potential endogeneity issues, we employ various strategies, and our results remain robust across these different approaches. We then estimate the heterogeneous impact of economic growth targets and demonstrate that the positive effect of these targets on pollution emissions tends to be less pronounced for firms situated in cities governed by female mayors. Conversely, the effect appears more pronounced for firms located in the western region, those operating in cities led by older mayors, and those in cities where mayors have lower levels of education. Finally, we explore potential mechanisms through which economic growth targets impact corporate pollution. Our results show that at the firm level, a higher economic growth target primarily leads to increased pollution emissions from enterprises by reducing firms' investment in pollution control. At the city level, an elevation in economic growth targets predominantly results in escalated enterprise-related pollution, chiefly due to its hindrance of urban green innovation, reduction in fiscal allocations for science and technology, and a decrease in educational fiscal outlays. These empirical findings strongly advocate for the implementation of measures aimed at dissuading prefecture-level city governments from formulating excessively ambitious economic growth targets, as a viable strategy for mitigating pollution stemming from manufacturing firms in developing nations. In view of this, our research is conducive to advancing the process of building a sustainable development path in China and providing reliable solutions to global ecological challenges.

Understanding the dynamics of how these gases cycle through the atmosphere is essential for assessing their respective contributions to the greenhouse effect and, consequently, their impact on global warming and climate change. The prime objective of this research is to examine the role of climatic change, agriculture output, and fertilizer use on the agriculture soil's greenhouse gas emissions. In doing so, the present study has focused on the temperature of land, fertilizer consumption, crop and livestock production, and energy used in agriculture soils on the pollution level of agricultural soils. The study further delineates the intricate interdependencies between climate change factors and GHG emissions using novel econometric methodologies, specifically the PMG-ARDL, SC-ARDL, and Dumitrescu Hurlin Panel Causality frameworks. In doing so, we use a large panel dataset spanning 1990 to 2020. The estimations show that climate change, as measured by variations in terrestrial temperature, has a discernible and positive impact on GHG emissions over the short and long term. Energy consumption and livestock production positively correlate with GHG emissions, with the former having a more pronounced effect. The implications of fertilizer usage and overall crop yield become noticeably significant in the long term. It emphasizes the importance of using a diachronic perspective when assessing GHG emissions in the agricultural sector. It is also worth noting that agricultural land use appears to negatively impact GHG emissions, emphasizing the importance of implementing sustainable land management practices to mitigate adverse environmental consequences. The study also explores the causality between climate change, agricultural practices, and GHG emissions, revealing a bidirectional association between climatic change and soil emissions. Additionally, unidirectional causation is observed from fertilizer consumption and crop production to emissions, underscoring the importance of adopting sustainable agricultural practices to reduce emissions.

To address this issue, this study investigates both the effect of industrial robot adoption on carbon dioxide emissions, as well as the mechanism through which this effect is transmitted using data from OECD and BRICS countries spanning from 1993 to 2015. In particular, we present three possible influence mechanisms of industrial robots on carbon dioxide emissions, namely, the economic growth effect, technological progress effect, and structural transformation effect.

The empirical results indicate that the increased use of industrial robots can significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions, particularly at higher quantiles of emissions. Moreover, the negative impacts of industrial robot adoption on carbon dioxide emissions are more pronounced in OECD, developed, and European and American countries compared to BRICS, developing, and non-European and American countries.

Considering that every activity causes environmental impact and the exploitation of natural resources, new systems that promote sustainable development and the efficient use of these resources become necessary. This paper presents the first study of the carbon footprint of the life cycle of integrating of sheep and olive farming, with the objective to build an inventory based on primary data collected on olive and sheep farms in Brazil, determine the carbon footprint of the conventional and integrated system and estimate the potential for mitigating GHG emissions. The evaluation was performed using the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The study focuses on the detailed analysis of the processes and activities that are responsible for GHG emissions, including enteric methane emissions, methane emissions from manure management, emissions from nitrogen fertilizer use and limestone application and energy consumption. For this, two major scenarios were considered, the first centered around on the traditional olive cultivation and sheep farming systems individually, and the second involved their synergistic integration. The findings indicate that the conventional system is associated with a global warming impact of 6.8 kg CO2eq per liter olive oil and kg live weight. In contrast, the integrated system demonstrates a significant mitigation potential of 27.7%, resulting in a reduced global warming impact of 4.92 kg CO2eq. This advantage is a consequence of the synergy between the systems, as they now occupy the same area, which allows the sharing of agricultural activities and agrochemical inputs, in addition to optimizing nutrient recycling and complementing each other. Additionally, the results of a sensitivity analysis showed that enteric methane from sheep and the application of limestone to the soil are the most influential parameters on the carbon footprint, indicating that they are key parameters for the development of GHG mitigation strategies, some of which were discussed in the article.

It is a hot research topic for carbon reduction, energy saving, and emission reduction in shipping. The over-expansion cycle with natural gas high-pressure direct-injection (HPDI) is a promising approach for reducing fuel consumption and emissions in marine engine. Two types of over-expansion cycles in a large-bore (500 mm) low-speed dual-fuel engine were investigated and compared. The variable compression (VC) cycle decreases the effective compression ratio by adjusting the exhaust valve closing (EVC) timing, and the variable expansion (VE) cycle raises the effective expansion ratio by varying the exhaust valve opening (EVO) timing and scavenging ports opening (SPO) timing. A specific sleeve mechanism was designed to precisely control the opening and closing of scavenging ports. The results reveal that the VC cycle exhibits an operable limit with a delay of 40 °CA in EVC, while the VE cycle has a limit with a delay of 60 °CA in EVO. The scavenging effect obtains improvement in the VC cycle, whereas it deteriorates in the VE cycle. Both the two cycles lead to reduced peak pressure and extended combustion duration. Compared to the baseline, the VC cycle and VE cycle can reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions by a maximum of 51.9% and 70.7%, respectively. However, the VE cycle can even reduce the equivalent indicated specific fuel consumption (EISFC) by 1.14 g/kWh when the EVO is delayed by 5 °CA. Importantly, the VE cycle exhibits a more favorable cost-effectiveness and potential for NOx emission reduction compared to the VC cycle, and it also demonstrates the capability to optimize NOx and EISFC simultaneously. This provides a method to produce cleaner marine engines with less fuel consumption in the future.

Here N-doped porous carbon flowers supported Fe3O4 nanoclusters (Fe3O4/NPCF) were designed for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction. The surface and crystal structures of electrocatalysts were regulated to enhance catalytic activity and mass transfer. As a result, Fe3O4/NPCF showed high selectivity for CO production. Its Faradaic efficiencies for CO production were 98.6–95.6% at 50–90 mA cm−2 in a H-type cell, which were significantly higher than NPCF supported other iron-based catalysts and N-doped mesoporous carbon supported Fe3O4 nanoclusters. The superior performance of Fe3O4/NPCF for CO production was attributed to the synergistic effect of Fe3O4 nanoclusters and NPCF, which significantly improved electrochemically active surface area, reduced diffusion layer thickness and *CO desorption energy.

Hence, it is crucial to explore the characteristics and trends of building carbon emissions to achieve the carbon peak and neutrality. While previous studies have made efforts to analyze the influencing factors through different approaches, developing an effective and intelligent regression model based on machine learning algorithms remains challenging in predicting the carbon emission trend. This study analyzed carbon emissions and per capita indicators of the building and construction sector in 30 provincial regions in China from 2005 to 2021. While embodied and operational carbon emissions contribute equally to the total emissions, the results showed a significant spatial-temporal correlation. Considering the emissions as target features, nine alternative machine learning regression models were developed using eight identified explanatory features incorporating scale, economic, technological, and classification factors. Based on performance metrics encompassing root mean squared error, coefficient of determination, and mean absolute percentage error, the stacking ensemble regression model was identified to have superior performance. This model was further employed to conduct a sensitivity analysis of explanatory features on carbon emissions. The results indicated that urbanization rate and population were the most sensitive factors, with varying effects on different target features. These findings can be used to predict carbon emission trends and promote carbon reduction policies in the building industry.

However, the complexity of interdependent consumer and enterprise decisions poses challenges to this process. In this study, we propose a new approach that combines complex networks and agent-based modelling (ABM) to develop a framework for the collaborative evolution of consumer and enterprise responses to green product promotion. We also innovatively include social factors in our model. This study investigates the impact of various factors on the adoption of green products, including consumer subsidies, government education and propaganda and carbon pricing. The results show that consumers and enterprises exhibit similar strategic evolutionary trends due to their interdependence and mutual influence. Consumer subsidies can effectively stimulate the widespread adoption of green products. Government education and propaganda activities in the initial stages of promotion can effectively drive the proliferation of green products at a relatively low cost. Carbon pricing plays a dual role in promoting the proliferation of green products. Lower carbon pricing has a minimal influence on the overall equilibrium proportions between traditional enterprises and green product enterprises. Higher carbon pricing can act as a catalyst for enterprise-level transformation, encouraging businesses to transition towards greener practices. Sensitivity analysis reveals that consumer subsidies remain the most critical factor in promoting green products, even in the presence of social factors.

This research proposed an innovative method of using steel slag coarse aggregate (SSCA) and steel slag powder (SSP) filler prepared by grinding solidified SSFA to replace ordinary natural resources to prepare stone mastic asphalt (SMA) mixture. The feasibility of the proposed utilization method of steel slag was determined based on the analysis results of main engineering performance, environmental impact and economic benefits of steel slag SMA mixture (SSSM). The ordinary SMA mixture (OSM) was functioned as a control group. The investigated main engineering performance included fatigue performance, moisture stability, high-temperature deformation resistance and low-temperature crack resistance. Environmental impact was evaluated based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) method, and the relationship between the transportation distance of steel slag, common basalt and the emission characteristics was deeply analyzed. In addition, economic benefits were determined based on the cost calculation results. Results showed that SSSM was superior to OSM in terms of these main engineering performance. The emissions from SMA mixtures increased with the extension of transportation distance of steel slag or basalt. From the perspective of reducing emissions, choosing steel slag aggregate had advantages when the transportation distance was less than 365 km, otherwise, it was recommended to choose basalt. Under three different transportation distances (short, medium and long distance transportation), the introduction of steel slag in SMA mixture reduced the greenhouse gas emissions by 1.1%–8.6%, of which the raw material production stage contributed the most. Furthermore, SSSM exhibited higher economic benefits, with a functional unit of SSSM pavement saving the cost by 14.4%–19.8%. Therefore, using steel slag as a substitute for coarse aggregate and filler in SMA mixture can promote the reuse of solidified SSFA, reduce the environmental impact and total cost of all stages of constructing SMA pavement.

A tripartite evolutionary game among the government, enterprises, and customers is constructed. In addition, the evolutionary courses of the game among the behaviors of government, enterprises, and customers are examined. On this basis, the influence of internal and external factors on the results is analyzed. MATLAB software is used for numerical simulation analysis to simulate the influence of some parameters on the decision-making of game players. The analysis demonstrates that: the subsidy for enterprises has a more significant influence on the behavior of the government than on those made by enterprises and customers. At this point, enterprises and customers will take more account of the government's decision, which will lead to the strategies of “low-carbon production mode” and “purchasing low-carbon products,” respectively. This paper focuses on the impacts of the low-carbon consumption subsidy policy and the “carbon inclusion” system on the evolution of the three parties. When carbon credits are at a reasonable level and low-carbon consumption subsidies are combined with carbon inclusion mechanism, it may be observed that the former is more effective in encouraging customers to purchase low-carbon products. In other words, this is the situation where the two policy implementations are most effective.

A major contributor to the degradation of planetary health is CO2 emissions that are contributed by the transportation sector. The brunt of the environmental degradation is experienced by developing countries, where the transportation sector is dependent on cheaper fossil-fuels. This study examines the causal interface between transportation infrastructure development, economic growth, institutional quality, and CO2 emissions in 79 developing countries over the period 2005 to 2022. A quantile-on-Quintile regression (QQR) and vector error-correction model (VECM) are deployed to study the causal relationships between the above-mentioned variables. The empirical findings show strong endogenous relationships between the variables in the short-run and long-run. The concerning trend is that, while the transportation sector and improvement in the institutions contribute positively to the economic growth of these countries, CO2 emissions (from the transportation sector) have a detrimental, and perhaps larger, impact on economic growth. A key insight from these findings is that there is a need to reduce CO2 emissions by ensuring greater use of renewable energy to power the transportation sector. A more environmentally-friendly transportation sector will be critical in enabling these countries to transition towards sustainable economic growth trajectories.

To explore the impact and mechanisms of manufacturing enterprises' digital transformation on reducing their carbon emissions, this study uses data from A-share listed manufacturing enterprises on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges from 2010 to 2019. Employing fixed-effect and mediation models, the empirical analyses yield the following results: (1) Digital transformation positively influences carbon emissions reduction in manufacturing enterprises. (2) The fulfillment of corporate social responsibility and advancement in technological innovation mediate the relationship between digital transformation and carbon emissions reduction. (3) Both internal (redundant resources) and external (government support) factors affect the impact of digital transformation on carbon emissions. Reducing redundant resources and strengthening government support amplify the positive effect of digital transformation, while redundant resources negatively regulate the initial phase of the impact path of “digital transformation - technological innovation–carbon emissions intensity”.

Moreover, complex uncertainties gradually existed in the IES which affect the system optimal situation and optimization results. In order to take full use of each agent's advantages and improve the performance of the whole region under uncertainty, this paper focuses on the multiple energy types' interaction of multi-agent IESs within the region to realize the stable operation, economic and environmental improvement of each agent and the whole region. To this aim, a multi-objective multiple energy types' multi-agent interactive optimization model considering energy demand and renewable energy output uncertainties was built. The model was based on Nash bargaining cooperative game theory and took economy, flexibility and carbon emission as objectives. Moreover, energy interaction scheduling and its corresponding price can be optimized through the model. The results of non-cooperative operation mode without interaction and cooperative operation mode with interaction were compared to analyze the superiority of interaction from the cost, carbon emission and flexibility aspects. The overall regional carbon emission and the economic cost has been reduced by 13.84% and 9.94%, for each IES, the carbon emission and economic cost could reduce by up to 41.5% and 44.5%. Moreover, the flexibility of the IES was correspondingly increased by nearly 47%. These results denoted that after multi-agent interaction, not only the overall region's energy, economic and environmental performance are improved, but also that of each agent are significantly improved.

Balancing these competing goals is especially intractable because most food systems are not locally bounded. This study aims to investigate the likely impacts on production, profit and the environment that result from aligning food systems to a healthy diet, as defined by EAT-Lancet. For this, we consider two distinct areas of the UK, one in East Anglia and the other in South Wales. These two regions reflect different ecosystems and therefore differing specialisations in UK agriculture. We used the Rothamsted Landscape Model (a detailed agroecosystems process-based model) to predict soil carbon dynamics, nutrient flows and crop production for the dominant crops grown in these regions, and the IPCC inventory models to estimate emissions from six livestock systems. Two scenarios were considered, one in which the study regions had to meet healthy diet requirements independently of each other and another in which they could do so collectively. To map their production to healthy diets, both study areas require increases in the production of plant proteins and reductions in the production of red meat. While changes in production can feed more people a healthy diet compared to the business-as-usual state, the overall calories produced reduces dramatically. Emissions and leaching decrease under the healthy diet scenarios and pesticide impacts remain largely unchanged. We show that local infrastructure and environment have a bearing on how “localised” food systems can be without running into substantial constraints. Whilst isolation of the farming system to a regional level, as explored here, is unlikely to be practical, we nevertheless demonstrate that aligning agricultural production towards healthier diets can generate food systems with many associated benefits in terms of agroecosystems' health and resilience to shocks in the food supply chain.";"2024-04-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624008229";"1";"Emissions"

This study established the coal and stove specific CO2 emissions inventory of RRCC based on investigated coal combustion of various coal and stove types, taking the region of Hebei in China as an example. The synergistic reduction effect of CO2 and pollutants was evaluated using 4 emission reduction scenarios. CO2 emission was 67.4% higher than estimates of RRCC based on the Statistical Yearbook and IPCC emission factors. The combination of bituminous coal and an advanced coal stove was the greatest contributor (62.1%) to CO2 emissions. Bituminous coal burnt in home Arcola has the highest per capita hourly and per unit calorific value CO2 emission, 2.3 and 2.4 times higher than the combination of anthracite briquette coal and pit coal stove and the combination of bituminous coal and an advanced coal stove, respectively. Except for NOx and CO, the coal-stove combination with the lowest per capita hourly and per unit calorific value emissions is anthracite briquette coal and an advanced coal stove.

As a result, it was possible to observe that, in the comparison of the CO2 footprint, modeled in the Eco Audit, there is a 15% reduction in emissions in the CO2 footprint for the BIW solution, as well as a 7% reduction in the Ceq total, in the on-site test and a saving of 260.40 L in fuel consumption, that is, the reduction in vehicle weight plays a significant role in reducing CO2 emissions, providing a mitigation factor for global warming.

In the industry, Ethylene glycol (EG) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are commonly employed as extractants. The selection of EG as the extractant was based on an investigation into the impact of relative volatility. Three distinct processes, namely conventional extractive distillation (CED), side-stream extractive distillation (SED), and heat pump extractive distillation (HPED), were evaluated by total annual cost (TAC), total energy consumption (TEC) and carbon dioxide emissions (CO2 emissions). The results demonstrate that both the enhanced SED and HPED processes effectively decrease energy consumption. Specifically, the TEC for the SED process exhibits a reduction of 15.36% compared to the CED process, resulting in a TAC saving of 9.06% and a decrease in CO2 emissions by 12.37%. Similarly, the HPED process surpasses the CED process by achieving a TAC saving of 15.41% and a CO2 emissions reduction of 22.61%. Consequently, this research presents a novel approach for the separation of MEK/IPA/water, offering significant practical implications.

However, because the food sector is one of the primary contributors of GHG emissions, the environmental impact of food products is now a new criterion for consumer product selection, and this includes milk. The current review investigates the state of the art of the environmental impact of animal-based milk (ABM) (cow, buffalo, goat, and sheep) and plant-based milk (PBM) (almond, oat, soy, pea, and coconut) systems using 70 milk life cycle assessment (LCA) studies. The critical review aims to produce two primary deliverables concerning the environmental impact of ABM and PBM. The first section is concerned with generating a universal LCA framework for ABM and PBM systems, as well as the recalculation of collated results to standardize and synthesize a full comparison of AM and PBM based on several eco indicators and presents a hierarchy of environmentally sustainable milk. From the synthesis of results, it was observed that the lowest mean of global warming potential (GWP) in ABM is cow milk, and in PBM is coconut milk, i.e., 1.29 and 0.257 kg CO2/kg of milk, respectively. The second section highlights the comparative effects of assumptions for LCA system functions i.e., system boundaries and impact allocation methodology, with critical insights. Apart from that, the current review also investigates the hotspots in ABM and PBM systems, presents the priority order of processes for the mitigation measures, and provides multiple mitigation strategies and their effect.

However, the features, changing trends, and determinants of the carbon footprint flow embodied in global population migration are poorly understood. This study employed social network analysis and the exponential random graph model (ERGM) to investigate the structural changes and drivers of the carbon footprint network embodied in global migration from 1995 to 2015. The results showed that approximately 50% of carbon footprint flow embodied in international migration flowed from developing to developed countries. The spatial connections between countries in the network were becoming increasingly close, displaying a typical small-world structure, and showing low reciprocity and negative assortativity. Moreover, centrality analysis highlighted the United States and the European Union as being at the core of the network, whereas some emerging economies (e.g., China, India, and South Africa) were shown as having an increasing influence on the network. The determinants of network formation were divided into three effects. For node attribute effect, countries with developed economy, high proportion of industrial value added, urbanization and openness were becoming the destinations of carbon inflows from immigrants, while countries with high consumption of renewable energy and energy intensity had a trend of carbon outflows with emigrants over periods. As for exogenous network effect, the significance of economic integration on the formation of the network was strengthening, while that of geographical proximity and cultural similarity was declining. Additionally, the positive impact of self-organizational effect on the network was decreasing. This study provided guidance for countries to formulate policies to reduce the carbon emissions embodied in international migration.

";" The integration of Green Logistics (GL) and Circular Economy (CE) have been recognized as critical concepts for achieving sustainable economic and environmental performance. However, there is a lack of understanding on the combine impacts of CE and GL in alleviating CO2 emissions in pioneering nations relying on these concepts. This study examines the role of CE and GL sustainable in curbing CO2 emissions of 13 developed European Union (EU) countries from 2000 to 2020. The neoclassical growth and IPAT models, including the pool mean autoregressive distributed lags (PMG-ARDL) and the vector error correction model (VECM) are employed to estimate the short- and long-run effects and heterogeneous causal relationships. The long-run results reveal that CE and GL can mitigate CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions, while the generation of municipal waste (GMW) has negative impact on the environment. Moreover, the long-run relationship between economic growth, CE, GL, and GMW validates the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The study also confirms a bidirectional causality between CE, GL, and CO2 emissions over the long run. This study proposes a model for assessing the impact of CE and GL initiatives on environmental performance and sustainability in both pioneering developed regions and emerging economies yet to embrace green growth concepts.

Electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to ethylene received great attention from the research society to decarbonize the ethylene production. In this study, a life-cycle analysis is conducted using the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model on the three electrocatalytic CO2-reduction pathways (or “e-ethylene” pathways): i) cascade conversion via carbon monoxide intermediate; ii) single-step conversion in membrane electrode assembly (MEA); and iii) single-step conversion in alkaline flow cell. The results showed that the electricity consumption is the lowest for the cascade pathway (164 MJ/kg), thus resulting in the lowest cradle-to-gate carbon intensity [18 kgCO2e/kg with United States (US) average grid)] among the three pathways followed by the single-step MEA (32 kgCO2e/kg) and then by the single-step alkaline (56 kgCO2e/kg). However, all three e-ethylene pathways were significantly more carbon-intensive than their fossil-based counterpart (1.1 kgCO2e/kg) due to their excessive energy consumption with the current state of technology. With renewable electricity, all three pathways yielded negative carbon intensity: from −3.1 kgCO2e/kg to −1.6 kgCO2e/kg depending on the source of CO2. The threshold carbon intensity of electricity (TCIE), defined as the upper bound of the carbon intensity of electricity to achieve lower carbon intensity for e-ethylene compared to fossil-based ethylene, is calculated for both current and future state of e-ethylene technologies. The cascade pathway had the highest TCIE out of the three e-ethylene pathways for both current (92 gCO2e/kWh) and future (124 gCO2e/kWh) state of technologies. However, the carbon intensity of average US grid (i.e., 467 and 303 gCO2e/kWh for current and future projections) were higher than the TCIEs of the corresponding timeline. Thus, reducing electricity requirement for e-ethylene pathways and bringing low-carbon generation mix in the United States (US) grid faster than the current projection are both essential to decarbonize ethylene and its downstream chemicals/polymers.

Such uncertainties may, in turn, have repercussions on environmental quality efforts. Accordingly, this study thoroughly explores the intricate relationships among several vital variables: economic policy uncertainty (EPU), economic growth, natural resource rent (NRR), renewable energy consumption (REC), and environmental quality. The geographical focus of this investigation is four Nordic economies (Sweden, Finland, Norway, and Denmark). The research method is firmly anchored in the STIRPAT framework, with a notable innovative twist. The CS-ARDL simulations estimate the long-term interaction between the series. One key advantage of the estimation model is the ability and robustness to handle reverse causality and endogeneity concerns in time-series econometric models. The empirical findings from this research demonstrate that EPU, economic growth, and NRR are primary indicators of increased CO2 emissions. These factors collectively contribute to the escalating trend of carbon emissions within the Nordic nations. In stark contrast, clean energy consumption emerges as a promising factor that not only counters the rising emissions trend but actively contributes to environmental quality. The importance of transitioning towards cleaner energy sources becomes evident in light of these findings. Policy-makers should recognize that economic policy uncertainty can be a potent driver of environmental pollution and should prioritize formulating transparent and consistent policies that attract investments in clean energy solutions.

Despite its importance, the impact of screen size on subsequent resource recovery and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction remains largely undetermined and varied. In this study, the influence of separator screen size for solid-liquid separation on resources recovery (bedding materials, biogas and nutrients) and GHG emissions reduction was evaluated. Taking a dairy farm with a stock of 1000 cows as an example, with the increasing of separator screen size from 0.5 mm to 5 mm, the results show that the annual bedding materials production decreased from 987.0 tons to 597.6 tons (dry basis), the annual biogas production increased from 32.5 × 104 m³ to 50.9 × 104 m³, the annual total nitrogen (TN) recovery increased from 35.8 tons to 44.4 tons, and the annual total phosphorus (TP) recovery increased from 8.2 tons to 10.1 tons.

In order to facilitate the optimization of renewal timing and strategy from the perspective of reducing the comprehensive global warming impacts, we put forward the low-carbon bridge renewal decision method referring to the ideas of consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) and dynamic LCA. In the proposed method, a comparative system boundary matching the bridge renewal characteristics is constructed, where the carbon emission reduction owing to the traffic efficiency improvement by functional updating is incorporated as the low-carbon benefits of renewal, and three types of time-dependent factors, i.e., time-dependent characterization factor, trend factors and changes of traffic demands, are introduced to characterize the influence of renewal timing. The proposed method provided guidance for the renewal of Maogang Bridge, the first long-span cable-stayed bridge in Shanghai. Results illustrate that the global warming impacts of renewal construction activities and the low-carbon benefits from functional updating decrease with the renewal timing. For Maogang Bridge, the rapidly increasing traffic demands inevitably advocated renewal in advance, and the reduction of global warming impacts from emission reduction or carbon uptake could be manifested for renewal in advance. Adopting material recycling in the disposal of old bridge helped reconstructing a new bridge while deconstructing the old one in 2019 becoming the finally selected low-carbon renewal strategy, which is expected to reduce 15.04 kt CO2e-2019 compared to the essential renewal in 2050 with the landfill disposal method. The robustness of the strategy choice has been justified, given the variations of analytical time horizon, expected emission trends and repair emissions.

In this study, we proposed a method for calculating CO2 emissions using Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) XCO2 (the column-averaged CO2 dry-air mole fraction) observations. We identified local XCO2 plume enhancements on the OCO-2 track and retrieved CO2 emissions through minimizing the difference between the XCO2 enhancement identified from OCO-2 and the XCO2 enhancement simulated by the Gaussian plume model based on emission rates provided by Open-Data Inventory for Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide (ODIAC). Among 473 cases successfully retrieved from the OCO-2 from September 2014 to June 2023, the average hourly estimated CO2 emissions (OCO-2 emissions) are 6166.52 tCO2/h with the uncertainty of 1604.51 tCO2/h. Comparison with ODIAC, EDGAR (Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research) and MEIC (Multi-resolution Emission Inventory for China) emission inventories shows that the OCO-2 emissions are slightly overestimated.

However, this task is inherently challenging due to the considerable uncertainties in the subsurface. In this work, we develop a novel deep learning-assisted Bayesian framework for identifying potential CO2 leakage sites based on the reservoir pressure transient behavior measured at the wellbores of injection or observation wells. The method consists of two essential steps: 1) Deep learning surrogate: This step aims to effectively replace the intensive high-fidelity simulation with an efficient deep learning surrogate. 2) Bayesian inversion: In this step, the posterior distributions of potential CO2 leakage locations are inverted, in which the surrogate serves as the forward model. The above two processes are automated using Bayesian optimization instead of a labor-intensive trial-and-error approach. The proposed framework is verified using a 3D geological model simulating CO2 sequestration into a brine-filled reservoir. The results demonstrate the Bayesian-optimized surrogate could successfully capture the underlying process of subsurface CO2-brine flow. The Bayesian inversion algorithm enables localizing CO2 leakage with high accuracy. To our knowledge, the proposed Bayesian framework is implemented for the first time to locate multiple leakage sites at the field scale.

To promote low-carbon development in the construction industry, it is essential to measure carbon emission efficiency (CEE) and analyze spatial differences, dynamic evolution, and influencing factors. This study measures CICEE in 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2019 and evaluates CEE using the minimum distance to a strong efficient frontier (MinDS) model with undesirable outputs. Subsequently, the Dagum Gini coefficient and its decomposition, as well as spatial autocorrelation analysis, are used to explore the sources of spatial differences and the spatial clustering pattern of CEE. The dynamic trend of CEE is analyzed through kernel density estimation, traditional and spatial Markov chains. Finally, geographical detectors are used to detect the explanatory factors and their interactions on spatial differences in CEE.

Additionally, the eastern region exhibits the highest intra-regional differences and the highest inter-regional differences with the western region.

Carbon emission accounting methods are direct strategies for obtaining carbon emission data from wastewater plants, but different accounting methods have certain limitations. In this study, the development history, the scope of application, the advantages and disadvantages of the emission factor, field monitoring, modeling methods, and machine learning methods were discussed. The reliability and accuracy of different accounting methods for direct and indirect emissions were compared and analyzed. In addition, the application progress of the accounting methods in developed and developing countries was discussed. This study shows that the specificity of emission factors directly affects the results obtained using the emission factor method. The field monitoring method is a relatively accurate approach, but it relies on new technology and a monitoring cycle of more than one year. The results obtained from long-term monitoring of the Anaerobic Oxic (AO) process are statistically greater (nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions averaging 2.25% of the nitrogen loading) than those obtained from short-term monitoring (N2O emissions averaging 0.032% of the nitrogen loading). The accuracy of the modeling approach relies on a good understanding of the pollutant fractions in the influent and the pollutant transformation mechanisms. In developed countries, compared to developing countries, most of the studies were conducted using on-site monitoring and modeling methods. In China, the emission factor method is used, which accounts for 44.4% of the total number of publications. Future research could refine the various GHG calculation methods and improve the accuracy of the calculations to meet the accounting needs of different wastewater treatment processes and different research objectives. This study provides insight into developing low carbon wastewater treatment processes and routes. It will also provide a reference for WWTPs to achieve carbon emission reduction.

To promote low-carbon development in the construction industry, it is essential to measure carbon emission efficiency (CEE) and analyze spatial differences, dynamic evolution, and influencing factors. This study measures CICEE in 30 provinces in China from 2005 to 2019 and evaluates CEE using the minimum distance to a strong efficient frontier (MinDS) model with undesirable outputs. Subsequently, the Dagum Gini coefficient and its decomposition, as well as spatial autocorrelation analysis, are used to explore the sources of spatial differences and the spatial clustering pattern of CEE. The dynamic trend of CEE is analyzed through kernel density estimation, traditional and spatial Markov chains. Finally, geographical detectors are used to detect the explanatory factors and their interactions on spatial differences in CEE. The results of this study show that the CICEE presents an increasing and then decreasing trend, with the highest CEE in the eastern region, followed by the central and northeastern regions, and the lowest in the western region.

Drawing on socio-technical theory, this study aims to explore the main antecedents and their influencing mechanisms on blockchain-based low-carbon emission management, as well as investigate whether reducing carbon emissions leads to improved firm performance. Using data from 395 online respondents recruited from Chinese companies, the results of PLS-SEM indicate that cost-benefit efficiency, socio-environmental competitive pressure, and environmental legitimacy positively influence both the basic and auxiliary adoption of blockchain in low-carbon emission management. Additionally, relative advantage and regulatory policy partially influence the adoption of blockchain, while technology readiness has no significant effect on either basic or auxiliary adoption. Furthermore, both the basic and auxiliary adoption of blockchain contribute to carbon emission reduction and improve firm performance (i.e., operational, economic, and social performance).

Few studies have analyzed the long-term dynamic evolution and driving factors of interregional carbon inequality from the perspective of HWB equity. This study calculates the changes in embodied CE and HWB and their interregional flows and changes in carbon inequality in 2007, 2012, and 2017 using a multiregional input‒output (MRIO) model, and analyzes the drivers of interregional CE/HWB transfer, and then makes policy implications. The results indicate that carbon inequality in China shows a worsening trend because of the mismatch between the change in CE transfers in carbon-intensive sectors and the change in HWB transfers in economic and social capital. At the national level, CE intensity, HWB intensity, production structure, and per capita consumption have the most significant effects on embodied CE and embodied HWB. The direction of the factor drivers affecting interregional net carbon emissions (NCE) and net human well-being (NWB) transfer depends largely on the resource endowment and the extent of the effects of the different drivers and development status of two regions. This study provides a new perspective for analyzing the evolution of carbon inequality in China and provides important insights for reducing carbon inequality and realizing carbon equity.

However, the least-cost, net-zero supply of electrical and thermal loads in residential buildings is affected by building type, local climate and grid emissions intensity and is subject to uncertain future energy prices. This work investigated a typical detached house and an apartment in two climates – temperate and sub-tropical – in Australia. Least-cost optimisation of the technology mixes required to serve building energy loads was undertaken, including a range of appliances powered by electricity, natural gas and hydrogen and the use of distributed energy resourced, notably rooftop solar and residential battery energy storage. Solutions were investigated with increasingly stringent greenhouse gas emission abatement constraints and a range of future prices for electricity and hydrogen, demonstrating: i) progressive electrification is the likely cheapest pathway to net-zero emissions for the two building types studied; ii) should grid decarbonisation lag the abatement constraint applied to the homes, a net-zero dwelling is likely unachievable and the deepest achievable abatement is very expensive; and iii) network-delivered hydrogen may be optimal in a subset of buildings with limited distributed energy resources potential and more peaky heating and hot water demands. In such cases, bio-methane or even synthetic methane may also be preferred. Through significant adoption of distributed energy resources, results suggest an affordable route to deep (i.e. > 50 %) abatement for homeowners that relies less on grid emissions and, beyond the Australian case study, can be extended to a significant proportion of dwellings in other countries.";"2024-04-05";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624009132";"2";"Emissions"

Therefore, this research aims to examine the role of the above factors in achieving GG by using 28 developed countries from 1995 to 2019. These countries have passed over a time of fast progress at the expense of heavy pollution and hence have moved their emphasis to GG. This paper starts with the construction of the GG index based on entropy-weighted TOPSIS, followed by pooled OLS, fixed effect, random effect, the two-step least-square estimator (2SLS), and the System GMM models for hypothesis testing. From the findings, it is obsense of that: (1) Green finance positively affects GG; the higher the levels of GG, the greater the enhancement of green finance on GG. (2) CTI favorably mediates the impact of green finance on GG, and the mediating effect accounts for 14.06% of the overall effect. (3) Environmental tax has a significant threshold effect on the link between green finance and CTI; when high levels of environmental taxes are maintained, the influence of green finance on enterprises' CTI is greatly strengthened, with an increase of 53%. GG will be further promoted by the advancement of enterprises' CTI. Finally, emerging counties would benefit from this study in designing frameworks of green finance, environmental tax, and CTI policies to achieve GG.

Power-to-gas (PtG) systems have emerged as a promising technological solution in the pursuit of mitigating carbon emissions. This paper presents a mathematical modeling framework that aims to accurately represent the power-to-gas system integrated with wind power plants while taking into account the technological constraints of the system in practical scenarios. To analyze the proposed system under the stresses, worst situations caused by existing uncertain parameters, especially wind power, is modeled using a risk modeling technique called downside risk constraints (DRC). The DRC endeavors to mitigate the likelihood of situations resulting in significant stresses by incorporating an expected downside risk into the proposed framework. This paper will provide a number of conservative tactics to be employed in the decision-making process under the realizations of uncertainties. These tactics, including strategic operational control strategies, provide a structured approach for decision-making under uncertain conditions. By incorporating downside risk constraints, the framework enables conservative decision-making that prioritizes mitigating potential losses and minimizing the operational risk within scheduling horizon of proposed PtG facility. The findings demonstrate that the implementation of PtG technology has the potential to yield a substantial reduction in external energy consumption, namely by 39.1 %. Additionally, it has been seen that PtG may effectively mitigate carbon emissions, resulting in a decrease of 38.9 %. The utilization of PtG technology and gas storage will result in a substantial reduction in wind curtailment, ultimately leading to a near elimination of curtailment. Further study is conducted on the model in order to explore the benefits of carbon and methane storage, as supported by the results obtained.

This paper assesses potential market-mediated impacts, including global Land Use Change (LUC) and GHG emissions, from increased subsidies to pasture-based livestock production in the EU. A tax recycling strategy (TRS) is simulated against a baseline up to 2030 under the shared socioeconomic pathway 2 (SSP2). This implies a budget-neutral increase in the level of pasture subsidies in individual Member States, as land subsidies for other cropping activities decrease. We employ the computable general equilibrium (CGE) model GTAP in its recursive-dynamic version, GTAP-RDEM, extended with the Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) database FABIO to disaggregate agri-food sectors from 21 to 31. This approach allows considering price- and income-dependent feedbacks when assessing long-run changes in the global economy, improving the sectoral resolution relative to GTAP v10. The policy increases pastureland areas and cattle production in almost all EU Member States, whereas cropland and crop production decrease, causing significant changes across EU agri-food markets. Crop prices increase, leading to the reduced output of intensive animal production sectors, mainly pig and poultry. Cropland areas decrease and most EU countries increase imports of grain, oilseeds, and cakes, essentially soybean cake from Brazil and North America. While GHG emissions decrease in those EU countries where pasturelands expand mainly at the cost of croplands, GHG emissions increase in those countries where pastureland expansion comes with forest loss. As a result, net GHG emissions increase in the EU-27 in 2030 (+2.49 Mt CO2-eq). Emissions from LUC in major non-EU grain- and oilseed-exporting countries increase, e.g., by 102.52 Mt CO2-eq in Brazil and by 129.17 Mt CO2-eq in North America. The simulated policy shows that promoting extensive livestock per se does not meet the objectives of the Common Agricultural Policy and the EU Green Deal. The TRS should be complemented with policies to foster crop diversification and promote the use of domestic feed sources (e.g., legumes) to effectively ensure feed self-sufficiency and that extensive cattle production in the EU does not lead to deforestation in carbon-rich countries.";"2024-04-05";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624005213";"9";"Emissions"

It is essential to understand the relationship between these characteristics and industrial aqueous Cd emissions during industrialization. In this study, a data-driven framework was proposed to reveal these relationships. The framework comprises two key steps. i) Three state-of-the-art tree-based machine learning models, including LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree and Random Forest, were trained to capture the relationships among variables. ii) Shapley additive explanation was utilized to decompose the contribution of the characteristics to the prediction for each sample. The trained LightGBM model demonstrated the most superior performance in predicting industrial aqueous Cd emissions in test datasets ( R 2 = 0.881 ± 0.0431 ， R M S E = 58.260 ± 11.839 ， M A E = 27.743 ± 3.274 ), significantly overperforming traditional linear regression model. Our analysis revealed that during our sample period, the influence of industrial characteristics on regional industrial aqueous Cd emissions was approximately 1.796 times greater than that of socioeconomic characteristics. Shifts in the characteristics of the non-ferrous metal industry contributed to approximately 74% of the average increase in industrial aqueous Cd emissions in China approximately. Regional emissions were found to be positively affected by average size and density but negatively affected by the operation duration of local non-ferrous metal industrial firms. Further driver analysis showed that the growth trajectory of emissions in China can be split into three stages based on the main drivers and growth rate: 2000–2002, 2003–2004, and 2005–2007. The proposed framework overcomes the limitations of the previous methods in terms of application scope, potential factor considerations, and regression structure predefinition. Our analysis implies that policymakers should proactively adjust industrial policies and emissions regulations in response to market shocks and industrial shifts, to a better management of industrial aqueous Cd emissions.

Carbon credits can be purchased from firms that perform better than their expected emissions cuts, or from companies that generate carbon dioxide removal using negative emissions technologies. Carbon trading is subject to constraints depending on the rate of generation or consumption of these credits, as well as the timeframe of these flows. In this work, a process integration-based approach is developed for planning carbon trading among corporations. A new pinch analysis methodology is proposed in this work for finding an optimal trading scheme among corporations buying and selling carbon credits. The combination of time intervals during which the credits are generated and purchased by different firms defines a planning horizon within which trading occurs. In the initial targeting step, the overall potential for carbon trading among firms is determined; this step also finds the temporal bottleneck (pinch point), the required import of carbon credits prior to this point in time, and opportunities to export surplus carbon credits afterward. The methodology can be implemented using either a new graphical tool called carbon trading pinch diagram, or the algebraic carbon trading method. Both approaches lead to the construction of the grand composite curve (GCC), which gives in-depth information about how to meet the targets. Three illustrative case studies show how the methodology can be used to identify targets for performance benchmarking, and generate allocation networks that achieve these targets.

The rapid expansion of inter-park trading markets is accompanied by a surge in carbon emissions, making industrial parks increasingly significant contributors to carbon emissions within the industrial sector. In response to this environmental challenge, this paper proposes an integrated trading approach within industrial parks that considers carbon constraints. By implementing a spot trading method for surplus industrial energy, the goal is to mitigate the carbon emission pressure within these parks. Firstly, the paper conducts an analysis of the characteristics of combined heat and power units in industrial parks. It introduces an integrated analysis method within the target region, consolidating information from various park units to enhance flexibility in energy utilization. Secondly, an energy storage model is established. This model efficiently leverages energy storage capacity to balance fluctuations in energy supply and demand within industrial parks, thereby alleviating carbon emission pressure. Finally, the study and analysis of an industrial park in Liaoning Province were conducted using the Yalmip + Gurobi commercial software on the MATLAB platform.

Field data reveal the high influencer-follower fit in green attitudes in that they mostly talk about green topics. Two experiments with real and fictional influencers show the negative implications of this attitude fit: the effect of green influencer posts on consumers’ usage intention is weaker when these consumers have similar green attitudes as the influencers (fit), whereas the effect is stronger when these posts reach a non-green audience (non-fit). This implies that green influencers should focus on reaching a non-green audience when promoting green consumption; alternatively, green behavioral intentions might increase through sustainable messages from non-green (e.g., beauty) influencers.";"2024-04-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624008977";"10";"Emissions"

Some provinces have first carried out in-depth treatment of the cement industry, and the national level will also introduce an implementation plan for ultra-low emission transformation of the cement industry to promote continuous improvement of China's air quality. In this work, a pollutant emission inventory covering the full life cycle of the cement industry, including organized emission, unorganized emission and transportation, was established based on pollutant discharge permit, Continuous Emission Monitoring System (CEMS) database and field investigation. And, the emission reduction potential of particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) after the implementation of ultra-low emission transformation in cement industry was evaluated. The results show that the existing dedusting, desulphurization and denitration technologies can control the concentrations of PM, SO2 and NOx below 10 mg/m3, 35 mg/m3 and 50 mg/m3, respectively. The emission reduction potential of PM, SO2 and NOx in cement industry is 259.54 kt, 14.98 kt and 607.04 kt, corresponding emission reduction ratio is 37%, 24% and 64%, respectively. In addition, this work reveals the spatial characteristics of pollutant emission level and emission reduction potential of the cement industry, which is conducive to the rational layout of ultra-low emission transformation, and push forward the transformation task by area and stage.

Qatar's oil and gas sector notably contributes to CO2 emissions, accounting for half of the total emissions. Globally, it is essential to transition into cleaner fossil fuel production to achieve carbon neutrality on a global scale. In this paper, we focus on clean hydrogen, considering carbon capture to make hydrogen a viable low carbon energy alternative for the transition to clean energy. This paper systematically reviews emerging technologies in carbon capture and conversion (CCC). First, the road map stated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to reach carbon neutrality is discussed along with pathways to decarbonize the energy sector in Qatar. Next, emerging CO2 removal technologies, including physical absorption using ionic liquids, chemical looping, and cryogenics, are explored and analyzed regarding their advancement and limitations, CO2 purity, scalability, and prospects. The advantages, limitations, and efficiency of the CO2 conversion technology to value-added products are grouped into chemical (plasma catalysis, electrochemical, and photochemical) and biological (photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic).

Utilizing a fixed-bed bench setup, the effect on gas and particle emission characteristics involving non-catalytic and catalytic (CeO2) processes of Pintex-U (PU) is investigated under various gaseous atmospheres (O2/NO2/H2O). The results indicate that the NO2/O2 atmosphere synergistically promotes oxidation efficiency ( η )·and gas emission, especially at 10% O2. The total particle number (PN) reaches its minimum at 21% O2 and 100 ppm NO2. With the addition of H2O (NO2/H2O), the η and CO2 are further improved, unfavorably total PN increases, but low NO2 concentration can mitigate this adverse effect. In scenarios with catalytic reactions, the catalytic activity is inhibited and the PN increases when only H2O is present. However, NO2/H2O/CeO2 maximally enhances the reaction by forming intermediates, favorably diminishing PN levels. The study pinpoints optimal conditions that facilitate ‘High η ' (efficiency) and ‘Low PN’ (emission), ultimately obtaining: 1) CeO2 and NO2/H2O/CeO2 conditions at 10% O2; 2) CeO2, NO2/CeO2, and NO2/H2O/CeO2 conditions at 21% O2.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.141483";"Research the synergistic carbon reduction effects of sulfur dioxide emissions trading policy ";" Since General Secretary Xi Jinping pledged the “30·60” targets to the world, the importance of pollution reduction and carbon reduction has become increasingly prominent. The previous focus on the pollution reduction effects of emission trading systems, while overlooking their carbon reduction impacts, as well as the limitations of research methods and scope, is no longer suitable for the needs of the new era. Therefore, this paper constructs a CGE model to study the synergistic effects, simulating the synergistic emission reduction effects of sulfur dioxide emission trading policies, and comes to the following conclusions: After the implementation of the sulfur dioxide emission trading mechanism, under different sulfur price scenarios, the synergistic reduction amounts of SO2 and CO2 vary greatly. As the sulfur price increases, the reduction amount becomes larger. In the five sulfur price scenarios set in this paper, the maximum reduction of SO2 can reach about 111,400 tons, and the maximum for CO2 is about 399 million tons. The CO2 reduction rate is approximately 1.0767 times that of SO2. This indicates that the sulfur dioxide emission trading policy is a very effective path for synergistic pollution and carbon reduction, with good reduction effects. In addition, sulfur dioxide emission trading will reduce the consumption of fossil energy, decrease industry output, raise product prices, cause GDP loss, and lead to reduced social welfare to varying degrees.

The findings suggest that GEG boosts green innovation by promoting the ""innovation compensation effect"" while inhibiting regional green development due to increased environmental costs, supported by the ""compliance cost effect"". The relationship between GEG and regional green development is moderated by economic development and environmental pollution in an inverted U-shaped pattern. When economic development and environmental pollution are at lesser levels, the positive effect of GEG amplifies as economic growth and environmental pollution ascend. However, if economic growth and environmental pollution continue to escalate, the positive impact of GEG will lose its strength. In low-carbon pilot cities, GEG negatively affects regional green development, whereas the opposite effect is seen in non-pilot cities. Regardless, there is an inverted U-shaped moderating impact of economic development or environmental pollution in both low-carbon pilot and non-pilot cities, yet the inflection point varies across regions. This paper offers an original perspective by creating a theoretical link between green development and environmental governance and emphasizes the significance of a nonlinear viewpoint when examining the relationship between variables in the regional green development process, thereby expanding our understanding of green development phenomena.

";" China's local environmental protection agencies are the basic government units that implement the country's environmental regulations. Initiated decades ago, the vertical environmental management reform was gradually rolled out throughout the country with the aim of enhancing the independence of local environmental enforcement by shifting the control of the agencies' resources from local governments to higher-level environmental protection authorities. This research investigates the effects and influencing channels of this reform on firm pollution behavior in China. Combining manually collected data on the timing of the reform at the county level with a unique firm-level emission dataset, we use a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the effect of the reform. Our results suggest that the reform leads to a significant reduction in firms' pollution, and this reduction is achieved mainly through a scaled-back production and a cleaner production process. A further analysis shows that the reform weakens local bureaucrats' political and economic incentives that could distort environmental enforcement. Our findings highlight the importance of minimizing political interventions in environmental governance in a large country like China to achieve environmental targets.

In the coming decades, the implementation of low-carbon technology (LCT) solutions in key industries will play a pivotal role in mitigating climate change. This study develops a graphical approach that integrates carbon emissions pinch analysis (CEPA), the best-worst method (BWM), and cost-benefit analysis (CBA) to assess LCTs in key industries. CEPA is used to identify LCTs that meet both economic and GHG reduction constraints, then the LCTs selected by CEPA are subjected to CBA, while BWM is applied to assess the weighted performance of LCTs in terms of their environmental, economic, social, and technological aspects. A comparison of the implementation priority sequence of LCTs was made between the dual constraints of carbon and economic considerations and a multi-factor perspective (environmental impact, economic benefits, social impact, and technological aspects). Finally, by incorporating the marginal abatement cost curve (MACC), the optimal low-carbon and economically viable technological pathway can be determined. This study analyzed 85 LCTs from global industries, including the power, food, agriculture, and land use (FAL), industry, transportation, and construction industries. The results for the global scenario from 2020 to 2050 indicate that 38 LCTs have been screened by CEPA to meet the dual constraints of carbon and economic performance, resulting in a GHG emissions reduction of 328.0 Gt CO2-e. Among them, the power industry was the major contributor, with a cumulative reduction of 197.3 Gt CO2-e, followed by the construction industry (97.9 Gt CO2-e), industry (25.4 Gt CO2-e), transportation (4.9 Gt CO2-e), and FAL (2.5 Gt CO2-e); an industry scenario analysis was conducted and listed low-carbon lists in key industries that meet the dual constraints of carbon and economy.

Monel 400 stands out among nickel alloys with its resistance to high corrosive environments. First, the Johnson-Cook material model for Monel 400 was developed for FEM simulations. Then, FEM simulations were performed using seven different machining parameters, including cutting and geometric, and validated with experimental results in the literature. The obtained FEM results were trained and predicted by regression and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) analysis. With this study, the Johnson-Cook material model of Monel 400 superalloy and the optimal machining parameters considering carbon emission with different cutting and geometric machining parameters are provided to the literature. As a result, it was determined that the most effective machining parameters in terms of cutting force were 139.04% increase in depth of cut, 74.23% increase in feed and 9.57% decrease in side rake angle. In terms of carbon emission, the most effective machining parameters were found to be −338.9g reduction in depth of cut, −294.3g reduction in feed rate and −171.9g reduction in cutting speed. In terms of training and prediction of FEM results, it was observed that the regression model was 89.19% for cutting force data and 95.39% for carbon emission, while the ANN model was 98.081% for cutting force data and 99.978% for carbon emission.

In this paper, a simulation model capable of exploring the interaction between the aftertreatment components was developed based on some relevant reaction mechanism, and the model accuracy was verified well using the experiment data. Then the effect of different parameters on the overall performance of the aftertreatment system was analyzed qualitatively. Finally, the importance score of each parameter was determined quantitatively based on Latin Hypercubic Sampling method and Random Forests algorithm. The results showed that larger diameter or larger cell density in DOC could improve the aftertreatment performance effectively. The increase in the wall thickness of each component had a negative impact on the aftertreatment system, except for CDPF wall thickness, which improved the filtration efficiency for particular matter (PM). When total aftertreatment length was fixed, high conversion efficiencies for carbon monoxide (CO) and total hydrocarbons (THC) were distributed in the region with large DOC length ratio, and NOx conversion efficiency was affected simultaneously by the length ratio of DOC, CDPF and SCR. An increase in CDPF length ratio and a decrease in DOC and SCR length ratios could contribute to the reduction of total pressure drop. Finally, Random Forests algorithm provided a good identification of the importance score of each parameter. DOC length and diameter played a dominant role in CO and THC conversion. The aftertreatment diameter had higher effect on NOx conversion efficiency than SCR length and PM filtration efficiency was mainly affected by DOC and CDPF length. Based on these qualitative and quantitative results, a design strategy for the integrated aftertreatment system was proposed, which provided some ideas for improving aftertreatment performance.

However, the characterization of innovative blends with reduced energy demand and environmental impact is nowadays a challenge to increase the profitability and deployment of carbon capture on an industrial scale. This work investigates an innovative non-proprietary amine blend, called HS3. This article presents the development of a full model (including thermodynamics, kinetics, and mass transfer) and its validation with pilot-scale data covering temperature, CO2 concentration, and capture rate ranges of interest for industrial applications. The model predicts the main process Key Performance Indicators, such as CO2 captured, stripped flow, and cycling capacity, with deviations from the measurements lower than 7%. Then, the validated model is exploited for sizing and designing a carbon capture process from the flue gas generated within an oil refinery. A special focus is devoted to energy integration and process optimization by means of a sensitivity analysis. Eventually, HS3 performances are compared to benchmark MEA in terms of energy requirements and unit operation sizing for the same case study. Results show that HS3 can reduce the specific reboiler duty (MJ/kg CO2 captured) and the required solvent flow per unit of flue gas (kg/kg) by 21% and 19%, respectively. Examples of comprehensive models developed starting from lab-scale testing up to the validation on a pilot scale are still limited in the literature. The validation in a semi-industrial pilot is needed to fully understand the solvent properties including, for instance, drawbacks which cannot be detected on a small scale. Needless to mention, reliable models are needed for consistent scale-up, techno-economic assessment, and LCA analysis.

Reduction in natural gas consumption and associated carbon emissions can be achieved through electrification of heat. However, the adoption of electric boilers is lethargic due to economic barriers. Hence, market-based policy interventions are required. This study aims to accelerate the adoption of electric boilers in the UK's chemical industry, aligning with the UK's ambitious 2035 industrial decarbonisation goals while considering economic impacts, by designing market-based policy interventions and comparing two adoption patterns. A novel multi-period Mixed-Integer Market Penetration Optimisation Model is developed and applied to inform decisions about transitioning from natural gas to electric boilers. The model is applied to a case study of all the heating systems (490 boilers) in the UK chemical industry from 1 MW to 60 MW boilers. Results show that effectively implementing a gas tax, electricity subsidy, annual grant and carbon tax can generate sufficient demand-pull to reduce the cost of electric boilers from 30 to 85 % depending on the boiler size. A carbon tax starting at £280 per tCO2e and reducing to £170 per tCO2e coupled with electricity subsidies is essential for this transition. The policies are designed such that a win-win is achieved between government and industry; specifically, revenue from the carbon tax and gas tax is used to support the grant and electricity subsidy thereby achieving cost neutrality for government. At 100 % uptake of electric boilers in 2033, the total carbon emissions reduce by 89 %, which is above the 2035 UK industry goal of 60 % reduction.

The findings show the following: (1) Spatial and temporal variations exist in AI development levels and energy conservation and carbon emission reduction. (2) AI has a significant negative impact on energy consumption efficiency and a significant negative spatial spillover effect on carbon emission efficiency, and the effects of AI development level on energy conservation and carbon emission reduction are mainly dominated short term. (3) Green technological progress on both the input and output sides has not played a determinant role in the effects of AI on energy conservation and carbon emission reduction. (4) Given the moderating effect of the degree of factor market development, the improvement of green technological advances can play a positive role in the impact of AI on energy and carbon reduction. These findings suggest the need to provide policy support for energy conservation and carbon emission reduction by improving the spatial and regional linkage mechanism to narrow spatial and temporal differences in development levels, formulating AI policies addressing regional heterogeneity to promote the full transformation of AI's short-term effects into long-term effects as well as emphasizing the negative role of green technological advances and accelerating the transformation of green technological achievements, among other measures.

The rapid growth of urban populations coupled with unsustainable urban planning practices exacerbates inherent conflicts, impeding our collective efforts to mitigate carbon emissions. In this context, we systematically decompose the key demographic, economic, and technological drivers of emissions, evaluating their contributions and spatial variations within African city boundaries from 2000 to 2020. By integrating three shared socioeconomic pathways (i.e., SSP119, SSP245, SSP434) and two urbanization strategies (i.e., linear and urbanization-led), we aim to assess the disparities in carbon mitigation outcomes that correspond to varying urban development trajectories by the year 2060, all while adhering to the same climate targets. Our findings reveal that the pursuit of urbanization may result in a substantial reduction in carbon mitigation efforts, with potential reductions ranging from 34% to a staggering 95%. In the ""Middle Road"" scenario (SSP434), we posit that land productivity must witness an increase of 26%–46% to attain mitigation outcomes comparable to those achieved through a linear trajectory. This implies that the concurrent efforts to urbanize and mitigate carbon emissions may narrow disparities among cities, limiting diversity of existing mitigation measures. The proactive planning of sustainable urban clusters and the provision of localized subsidies for clean energy are imperative to fortify urban climate resilience.

This paper uses kernel density estimation and standard deviation ellipses based on Pearl River Delta data from 2012 to 2021 to explore the spatiotemporal evolution trends of green financing and carbon emissions. Additionally, it uses a spatial Durbin model to examine the spatial effects of green finance on carbon emissions. The results indicate the following: Firstly, over the years, green finance shows an overall increasing trend, with an internal spatial pattern characterized by higher levels in the northeast and lower levels in the southwest. In contrast, carbon emissions are decreasing, with an internal spatial pattern characterized by higher levels in the southwest and lower levels in the northeast. Secondly, more and more green financing initiatives are aiming towards the Pearl River Delta's northeast, suggesting a more significant concentration of such initiatives there than elsewhere. At the same time, carbon emissions seem to converge on the southwest of the Pearl River Delta, which could indicate that this area generally has greater carbon emission levels. Finally, the spatial effect results reveal that improving green finance levels can significantly inhibit carbon emission levels in the Pearl River Delta region. Evidence of spatial spillover effects indicates that the carbon emissions in neighboring areas are influenced to some extent. This study on green finance and carbon emissions' spatiotemporal characteristics and spatial impact gives a development path and theoretical support for sustainable development goals in the global economy.

Novel pathways for CO2 utilization to produce formic acid are proposed namely solute phase electroreduction, gas phase electroreduction, and hydrogenation, are investigated. Employing multi-objective optimization with a deep neural network surrogate model, this study identifies optimal process conditions balancing capital and operational expenditures. The result shows that CO2 hydrogenation ($868 ton−1) exhibits the lowest production cost followed by gas-phase electroreduction ($986 ton−1) and solute-phase electroreduction ($2103 ton−1). The result also shows that without any intervention at all only hydrogenation can generate profit. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis of CO2 emissions indicates that gas phase electroreduction results in the lowest CO2 emissions (0.7 kg CO2 kgHCOOH −1) among the examined pathways. Insights from our research suggest a minimum current density of 417.3 mA cm−2 is recommended to achieve at least parity with hydrogenation in terms of production cost. To push the commercialization of gas-phase electroreduction, besides current density improvement, electricity cost reduction, and carbon trading mechanism is proposed to reduce the production cost.

Within this research framework, ANN serves as an intelligent model for autonomously learning input data features by capturing the nonlinear and dynamic relationships within the data. This study thoroughly simulates and analyzes the intricate relationship between digital empowerment and win-win cooperation in green and low-carbon industrial development. The findings indicate a regional decreasing trend in digital empowerment in China, with percentages of 87.39%, 79.05%, and 65.85%, respectively.

However, the impacts of salty BSFF derived from kitchen waste (KW) on soil properties and greenhouse gas emissions are unclear. The impacts of salty black soldier fly (Hermetia illucens) frass derived from KW on soil properties and greenhouse gas emissions were investigated. The frass amendments increased soil dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen (0.5–1.6 and 0.1–15 fold) and soil ammonium (0.5–31 fold) content, with a similar trend as soil pH (0∼0.4 fold) and electrical conductivity (2–131 fold). Soil gas emissions (CO2 and N2O) increased by frass amendments. The frass amendment affected the microbial communities followed by the addition rates, with the enriched beneficial bacteria (Nocardioides) and depleted denitrification fungi (Penicillium) as well as the C- and N-cycle related microbial functional genes. The nirS and amoB genes were the critical factors in the soil N2O emission with the frass amendment ratio in the soil.

The country has pledged to cut its emissions by 278 million tons of CO2e per year by 2030. This paper contributes a modeling view on the climate-related effects of various energy policies on the Saudi energy system. We use an energy system model designed to represent seven sectors in the Saudi economy. In addition to a baseline, which entails the continuation of current domestic policies, we look at a scenario that incorporates some of the plans announced by the Saudi government. We also examine the baseline scenario with a cap on total CO2 emissions equal to those exhibited with the announced plans. The model then makes the necessary decisions to abate CO2. We find that the energy system contributes 130 million tons of CO2e to the nationally determined contribution amount in 2030. Also, a non-prescriptive scenario that caps energy-system CO2 emissions produces the same emissions reductions as the announced plans while lowering the present cost by 2030 by $70 billion. The corresponding implicit marginal abatement cost of CO2 approaches 35 $/tonCO2 by 2045. This cost would displace around half of crude and fuel oil use in the Saudi energy system.

Given the construction industry's significant energy consumption, it is crucial to curtail energy consumption and CO2 emissions in this sector. This study aims to predict and trade-off four essential objectives: time, cost, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions. Initially, various factors affecting time and cost was identified using the CoCoSo method. Subsequently, 11 machine learning algorithms were employed to predict all four targets. Results revealed that support vector regression achieved an accuracy of 95.77% in project duration prediction, while the neural network algorithm demonstrated accuracy of 93.64%, 97.63%, and 97.99% in predicting cost, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions, respectively. Additionally, the research findings from six scenarios highlighted the non-linear relationship among project objectives. Deviating from the optimal point resulted in increases on both sides, with more significant impacts observed at values less than optimal duration. This research equips engineers with a valuable tool for accurately predicting project outcomes by adjusting input values, ensuring successful project execution and efficient resource allocation. Additionally, the framework's predictive abilities are beneficial for companies with energy and CO2 policies, influencing various sectors, regions, and policies tied to energy, emissions, costs, climate change, ESG, and UN SDGs.

As an important part of carbon sink, the improvement of net carbon efficiency in the plantations industry will make a great contribution to the realization of the “double carbon” target in agriculture. However, there are large spatial and temporal differences in the net carbon efficiency of the plantations sector in various provinces, and there is still a large scope for increasing carbon sink and reducing carbon emission. In this paper, we have analyzed spatial and temporal trends in the net carbon sink efficiency of the plantations' production processes in 31 provinces in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) from 2000 to 2020. On this basis, we have analyzed the influencing factors of net carbon efficiency in the plantations' production process through an extended Kaya constant equation. Through the geographically and temporally weighted regression model, we explore the spatio-temporal heterogeneity of the influencing factors, and further analyze the driving and restraining factors of net carbon efficiency in plantations' production process, in order to propose appropriate countermeasures. The study shows that: (1) The net carbon efficiency of plantations sector in China increase between 2000 and 2020, and the development of net carbon efficiency is uneven across regions. (2) The geographic center of net carbon efficiency of China's plantations industry shift from the northeast to the southwest and is consistent with the migration direction of agricultural inputs. (3) The influencing factors of net carbon efficiency in the plantations sector show large regional differences, and can be specifically divided into four major types of zones. In this regard, this paper provides more appropriate countermeasure suggestions for increasing carbon sink and reducing carbon emission in each zone, with a view to achieving the goal of double carbon in agriculture with practical significance.

The net spillovers from inflation are usually positive in the short-term, indicating that it is a net information transmitter.

By presenting life cycle inventories and discussing GHG-emissions hotspots, this work will inform stakeholders along the plastic supply chain of the necessary steps to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, and potentially, how to drive net-uptake. This work is of critical importance given the overwhelming mass of plastic produced annually and the resulting CO2 emissions. To conduct this assessment, we derive life cycle inventories for nine different bio-based plastics and address the impact of methodological choices, such as allocation method, on the resulting 100a global warming potential (GWP). Our findings show that resources used and processing methods implemented have significant effects on the potential for us to derive carbon-negative plastics. Furthermore, we find that environmental impact quantification methods greatly influence the perceived GWP of such processes. For example, economic and mass allocation methods resulted in an apparent increase in GWP of up to 39% and 166%, respectively, compared to no allocation for bio-based plastics made from 2nd generation crops, whereas mass allocation resulted in the lowest GWP for bio-based plastics made from 1st generation crops. In considering environmental impact hotspots, our findings show that decarbonization of thermal energy and electricity, reduced use of ammonia-based fertilizer, renewable hydrogen production, use of bio-based alternatives for petrochemicals and plasticizers, enzyme production pathways from 2nd generation crops, and more efficient biomass conversion processes to reduce feedstock inputs may be critical steps in creating GHG-negative bio-based plastics in the future.

This paper establishes a novel grey differential dynamic multivariate prediction model with recurrent neural network. It uses the grey differential dynamic multivariate prediction model to describe the dynamic characteristics of the nonlinear system. And it uses recurrent neural network to extract data features. The new model is used to compensate for the shortcomings of the grey prediction model that use the least squares method to solve the model parameters affecting the accuracy of the model. The numerical solution of the whitening equations of the new model visualizes the hidden layer state function of the recurrent neural network. The optimal parameters of the new model are obtained through repeated training to improve the prediction accuracy of the model. Finally, the new model is applied to the prediction of China's CO2 emissions to verify the validity of the new model from four different perspectives.

The development speed of regional sustainable transformation shows a change from decreasing to increasing. In recent years, there is a significant change in the acceleration of regional sustainable development in China, with the vast majority of provinces having positive acceleration and only three provinces having negative acceleration.

Nevertheless, the current quantitative research regarding the extent of PAR's impact on ecological restoration remains limited. This study focuses on Guizhou Province and aims to quantify the impact of PAR on the region's carbon sink capacity. Upon examining the alterations in Guizhou's Net Ecosystem Productivity (NEP) spanning the period from 2002 to 2021, our analysis revealed a fluctuating, yet predominantly upward trajectory. The average linear regression coefficient of 0.0046. Turning points in NEP evolution were observed in 2014, corroborating that the implementation of PAR in 2015 promoted ecological restoration. Accumulated data from four years of social research revealed noticeable changes in the production and lifestyle of residents in the relocation areas, contributing positively to ecological restoration. During 2015 to 2021, the ridge regression average trend coefficient in the research area was 0.0066. In 52.77% of the research area, there was no significant correlation between the population of PAR and the NEP variable. Among the significantly correlated regions, migration was positively associated with NEP variables, accounting for 55.74% of the total. The average contribution of PAR was 4.62%, showing regional variations, with a notably positive impact in severely rocky desertification areas and predominantly negative effects in non-karst regions. Our study findings suggest a positive influence of PAR on bolstering carbon sinks capacity, though this impact exhibits regional variations. We suggest reinforcing the management of land vacated through PAR by integrating it with ecological industries. For other regions intending to achieve ecological restoration and poverty alleviation through immigration relocation, it is advisable to implement measures tailored to the specific local conditions.";"2024-03-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624007212";"10";"Emissions"

Our comprehensive research explores a variety of determinants that sway Taiwanese consumers in their buying behaviors, specifically focusing on the influence of these carbon footprint labels. Surprisingly, while one might anticipate media exposure to be a dominant force in shaping opinions, our findings suggest its role remains relatively limited in this context. Instead, personal experiences with climate events and robust influences from family and peers emerge as the primary drivers in purchasing decisions. These direct interpersonal interactions, both in terms of shared experiences and word-of-mouth recommendations, offer profound insights into shaping consumer behavior. As Taiwan ambitiously targets net-zero emissions by 2050, harnessing the power of these social dynamics becomes imperative.

By drawing on an original dataset on global value chain participation, emissions of nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides, and green patents for European regions, we present novel evidence about the relationship between global value chains, green technologies and air pollution at the regional level. Our findings suggest that although participation in global value chains may lead to lower polluting emissions, this effect largely depends on the capacity of regions to exploit the green knowledge deriving from participation and on the specific form of participation. When European regions are integrated with backward linkages (i.e., importing inputs to produce exports) they record lower levels of air pollution; conversely, participation through forward linkages (i.e., exporting inputs for other places’ exports) leads to an increase in air pollution. Backward participation also come out to support the development of green technologies that mediate the effects of global value chains on the environment posited by the “Pollution Haven” hypothesis. Overall, the relationship between global value chains participation and air pollution will depend on the type of participation and on the capacity of territories to profit it for the development of green technologies.";"2024-03-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624006279";"3";"Emissions"

This study proposes a novel approach that leverages ensemble models and correlation analysis based on Landsat-8 satellite data to forecast LST and explore its environmental relationships. Time-series satellite data spanning winter and summer seasons of 2018–2019 was retrieved from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. LST, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), rainfall, and evapotranspiration (ET) datasets were derived from Landsat-8 data within GEE to facilitate LST modeling. The ensemble framework combines three powerful machine learning algorithms: XG-Boost, Bagging-XG-Boost, and AdaBoost, to enhance the accuracy and robustness of LST predictions. Compared to standalone models, the proposed ensemble models demonstrated significant improvements in LST prediction accuracy. While XG-Boost and AdaBoost achieved moderate accuracies with R2 values of 0.57 and 0.60, respectively, the Bagging ensemble model surpassed them with an outstanding R2 of 0.75. Furthermore, a correlation analysis by using linear regression (LR) model explored the relationships between ET, rainfall, NDVI, and LST. The analysis revealed strong positive correlations between NDVI and ET (R2 = 0.95), while correlations between NDVI and LST (R2 = 0.31) and NDVI and rainfall (R2 = 0.47) were weaker.

Recognizing the pivotal role of public attention (PA) in shaping business behavior is imperative for advancing a sustainable and environmentally friendly economy. Consequently, this study delves into the relationship between PA and corporate green innovation (CGI) by analyzing data from A-share industrial listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen spanning the years 2011–2020. The analysis employs fixed effects and a mediation model to provide a nuanced understanding of the dynamics involved. The study's findings underscore the following key points: (1) Elevated levels of public attention significantly influence CGI. (2) Government research and development (R&D) subsidies assume a regulatory role in the interplay between PA and CGI, particularly within state-owned enterprises, as well as the mining and manufacturing industries. However, it is noteworthy that an overly generous subsidy policy may inadvertently stifle corporate R&D innovation. (3) Government environmental regulations and corporate social responsibility indirectly shape the association between PA and corporate R&D innovation. Consequently, a fundamental strategy for fostering corporate green development lies in the effective management of government R&D subsidies and environmental regulations. Striking the right balance in these aspects while urging businesses to augment their sense of social responsibility is vital. This approach will pave the way for an efficient and enduring interaction system among the public, government, and companies, ultimately facilitating sustainable development and contributing to the realization of a beautiful China.

Harnessing the existing excessive CO2 to promote agriculture production is significant but filled with challenges. To this end, we proposed a concentration gradient-regulated CO2 enrichment system for capturing CO2 into greenhouses, which requires suitable CO2 sorbents with sufficient CO2 desorption capacity and high hydrophobicity at ambient temperature and pressure. Zeolites with different framework types and cations were detected by CO2 desorption and cyclic stability test under simulated agricultural production conditions. The results indicate that larger pore volume cooperated with higher Si/Al ratio and weaker alkali cations may be critical determinants for balancing high CO2 adsorption-desorption capacities and hydrophobicity in crop-cultivated environments. H-SSZ-13 zeolite is identified as the potential sorbents and exhibits exceptional CO2 release abilities and cyclic stability in tomato-grown environment. Long-term application of H-SSZ-13 zeolite to tomato plants significantly stimulated photosynthetic processes, particularly the Calvin-Benson cycle, culminating in notable improvements in plant growth, fruit yield and quality. This investigation provides a promising solution to develop a carbon-neutral CO2 enrichment system for both sustainable and productive greenhouse production.

Specifically, firms strategically relocate their operations to countries with lower carbon costs, where they can produce goods more cheaply and without carbon constraints. CBAM is a carbon tariff on carbon intensive products imported by the European Union. While the CBAM has the potential to reduce global carbon emissions, it poses significant risks to South Korea, which relies heavily on exports of CBAM-affected products. This study provides an overview of the potential effects of the CBAM on industries in South Korea, applies event study analysis to quantitatively evaluate how the financial market has reacted to CBAM-related events. Based on the research findings, as the details of CBAM become clearer, there is a shift in perception from environmental goals to broader issues across industries. Building on this understanding, we discuss issues related to the CBAM enactment: firm-level carbon accounting, EC-certified accreditation institutions, and the carbon allowance price gap between the EU and South Korea.

The findings reveal a robust positive feedback loop, highlighting the cumulative effect of continuous improvements in carbon sequestration over time. The study identifies concerning trends where agricultural emissions negatively impact carbon sequestration. For every one-unit increase in agricultural emissions, the results indicate a significant 0.50% decrease in carbon sequestration. Environmental taxes emerge as a powerful policy instrument, demonstrating a remarkable 2.28% increase in the long-term carbon sequestration rate for each one-unit increase. Technological innovation contributes subtly but positively, resulting in a 0.31% increase in carbon sequestration for every one-unit advancement. In contrast, foreign direct investment leads to a marginal 0.06% reduction in carbon sequestration, highlighting the potential challenges of globalization. Upon examining interaction terms, the study recognises the crucial role of environmental taxes in reducing the negative impacts of CO2 emissions from agricultural activities on carbon sequestration. A 1% increase in environmental tax corresponds to a significant 0.40% decrease in adverse effects, underscoring the transformative potential of well-designed tax policies in promoting sustainable agricultural practices. However, technological innovation has a limited mediating role, resulting in a modest 0.03% decrease in adverse effects for a 1% increase in innovation adoption. In conclusion, the study emphasises the critical importance of targeted environmental taxation policies in promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

Traditional research on three-dimensional bin packing has concentrated on maximizing spatial utilization under fixed box dimensions. However, in the practical context of e-commerce, packing boxes exhibit a wide range of sizes within a single warehouse. Customizing packing to prevent material and space wastage has become crucial for sustainable development. This paper innovates traditional three-dimensional packing research by introducing open dimensions instead of fixed ones. It addresses challenges in e-commerce packing, such as multiple orders and diverse bin shapes, to formulate a mixed-integer programming model. Focused on the carbon emission lifecycle’s usage phase for packing boxes, the model aims to minimize associated costs while ensuring that items’ weight, the center of gravity, sufficient support, and non-overlapping placement are maintained during the packing process. It also incorporates one-dimensional and two-dimensional fixed bin sizes. To solve this model, the paper proposes an improved hybrid genetic algorithm for stack sequence optimization. This algorithm systematically optimizes the dimensions for each box type. Building upon this, the study introduces an algorithm capable of estimating packing material consumption and the percentage reduction in carbon emissions during the packing process, given the known variability in packing box utilization. These two algorithms are integrated into an open-dimension packing box warehouse management ecological closed loop system designed for the B2B e-commerce context. In experiments with the proposed model and algorithms, the results demonstrate an average packing rate improvement of 10%–12% compared to alternative methods. Additionally, packing material consumption and carbon emissions are reduced by approximately 16.56%–19.85%, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Analysis was performed using the ARDL estimator, robustness test and Dumitrescu-Hurlin panel causality (DHC) test. Long-term empirical estimates from the PMG-ARDL technique have shown that a 1 % increase in TI and REC reduces EF by 0.064 % and 0.234 %, respectively, i.e. increases environmental sustainability. At this point, it is possible to say that TI and REC contribute to the achievement of SDG-7 and 13 in E-7 countries while NRR and real income (GDP) were found to impede the achievement of SDG-7 and 13 in E-7 countries through an increase in EF. The results were confirmed using robustness techniques. In the DHC test results, while there is a unidirectional causality from TI to EF, from EF to NRR and trade openness, a bidirectional causality was found between GDP and EF.

The study on the contribution of GHGs from smoldering coal fires to climate warming has been a disputed topic. This work proposes a novel approach to estimating GHG emissions from coal smoldering by measuring CO2, CH4, and CO under different thermal environments (220, 240, 260, and 300 °C). Results indicate that the contribution of CO2 produced by smoldering to the greenhouse effect decreased from 33.67 % to 23.52 % as thermal environments increased. The comprehensive effect of greenhouse effect induced by the precursors (CH4 and CO) increased from 66.33 % to 76.48 %, showing that the impact of precursors on the greenhouse effect should not be ignored. Additionally, the study demonstrates that the greenhouse effect generated by smoldering accounts for 18.40 %–40.92 % of the equivalent emissions produced by the complete combustion of the same mass of coal. This suggests that not all combustibles undergo conversion into greenhouse gases during the smoldering process. The annual amount of GHG emissions from coal fires in China is estimated as 6.52–42.27 million tons. Importantly, this study calculates basin-specific emission factors based on coal smoldering, providing a more accurate approach for determining the GHG emissions from coal fires.

The developed model consists of heat recovery units, water gas shift (WGS), low-temperature electrolysis of H 2 O , thermophotovoltaic converter, C O 2 capture by absorption and oxy-hydrogen firing ovens and furnaces. The recovered thermal energy generated steam and distilled H 2 O feedstocks for WGS and PEMEC (proton exchange membrane electrolyser cell) units. WGS converted CO to CO 2 and increased the H 2 production rate before separation from other by-products in the (PSA) pressure swing adsorption column. H 2 O electrolysis generated more H 2 fuel for the coke oven, Fe- CaO oven-sinter, BF and BOF. The result of the proposed system reveals that by utilising H 2 as fuel and O 2 as oxidant instead of burning natural gas (NG) for thermal decomposition of feedstocks, 1111.4 kg/h of C O 2 emission for every 626 kg/h of produced steel can be prevented.

The carbonation route also mitigates the environmental impact of pollutant emissions; however, it introduces a burden shifting associated with energy and resource consumption. Furthermore, to tackle the challenges of industrial application of steel slag carbonation, this study has explored upgrading schemes and proposed a future carbonation steel slag route that achieves process upgrades. By enabling carbonation of flue gas and improving carbonation efficiency, this route is forecasted to elevate the potential of carbon footprint reduction from 5% to 15% throughout the entire life cycle of steelmaking process. The study confirms that steel slag carbonation is a viable carbon-negative technology, delivering a substantiated CCUS solution for achieving co-benefits of pollution and carbon reduction in the steel industry.

It has been considered as a bottleneck for the sustainable development of the remanufacturing industry. In response, this study aims to propose strategies that can enhance the quality of remanufactured goods, thereby stimulating consumer demand and fostering the growth of the remanufacturing sector. To achieve this objective, a two-stage model incorporating the original manufacturer, remanufacturer, and retailer was formulated, with a particular emphasis on carbon -neutral objectives. The study explores the impact of the government's dual policy, encompassing cap-and-trade mechanisms and subsidies, on the quality-linked strategies adopted by remanufacturing enterprises. A comparative analysis was conducted to evaluate the effects of different government subsidy approaches, considering scenarios without subsidies, subsidies to consumers, and subsidies to enterprises, all contingent on carbon emissions from enterprises. The findings of our analysis revealed that, under carbon emission limits, an increase in the government subsidy coefficient linked to carbon emissions effectively heightens consumers' willingness to purchase remanufactured products. This, in turn, leads to an improvement in the overall quality of remanufactured goods and an expansion of the remanufacturing industry. Notably, the impact of combining government subsidies with carbon allowance trading varies, with subsidies proving more advantageous for improving the economic and environmental efficiency of the manufacturing process as well as enhancing consumer surplus and social welfare within the industry under specific conditions of subsidy amounts and carbon emissions. The proposed model's validity and reliability were affirmed through arithmetic simulations. In conclusion, this study presents a novel strategy aimed at improving the quality of remanufactured goods, fostering customer purchase intention, and generating a combination of economic, environmental, and social benefits for enterprises. The findings of this research offer valuable insights for the development of low-carbon legislation, serving as a guide for policymakers in the quest for sustainable manufacturing practices.

Based on a sample of 43 major economies from 2000 to 2014, this paper empirically examines the influence of digital transformation on the international carbon competitiveness of the manufacturing sector. The results reveal a substantial enhancement in manufacturing's international carbon competitiveness facilitated by digital transformation. Three primary mechanisms drive this enhancement: the scale effect, advancement of the forward global value chains position, and an improved energy structure. Notably, both domestic and foreign sources of digital transformation bolster the international carbon competitiveness of domestic manufacturing. Furthermore, the enabling of segmented digital industry strengthens this competitiveness, especially in publishing, programming, and broadcasting activities.

However, the reduction varies with fleet sizes (i.e., the number of different types of bikes in the market) and layouts. The excessive commercialization of SMMS has resulted in a decline in carbon benefits. In this study, we propose an agent-based model integrated with a lifecycle assessment (LCA) approach to evaluating the carbon benefits of unknown shared bike scale scenarios by establishing a brand-new SMMS. The proportion of satisfied actual trip demand and bike utilization rates also be analyzed for exploring the inherent mechanisms of SMMS. Take San Francisco, California, as an example, the evaluation of free-floating shared electric bikes and station-based shared-bikes analyzes five different layouts, each consisting of 121 different combinations. The results indicate that, for an area of approximately 100 km2 with a daily travel demand of over ten thousand, a fleet size of 4500–7500 bikes is suggested, potentially leading to a weekly carbon reduction of 10,000–11,000 kg CO2-eq.

However, the primary challenge lies in designing environmentally friendly biomass-use structures. This research introduces a novel trigeneration system that integrates power, cooling, and heat production through biomass combustion to address this issue. As another novelty in system development, the proposed system includes a carbon dioxide capture unit, further enhancing the system. The proposed framework consists of several subsystems: an organic Rankine cycle, an absorption chiller, a carbon dioxide capture cycle utilizing monoethanolamine solvent, a liquefied natural gas regasification unit, and a low-pressure steam production boiler. The newly developed system is modeled using the Aspen HYSYS software and is assessed from thermodynamic, economic, and environmental perspectives. Also, a parametric analysis is conducted to examine the impact of key design parameters on the system’s performance. Based on the study’s findings, it can be observed that the energy and exergy efficiencies amount to 58.4 % and 17.09 %, respectively. In addition, the suggested procedure exhibits a total exergy destruction of 53,636 kW. The findings of the environmental impact assessment indicate that the shift from power generation to trigeneration scenario results in a substantial decrease in carbon dioxide emissions. Specifically, the emission reduction potential ranges from 0.24 to 0.041 kg/kWh. Furthermore, the economic evaluation shows that the system reaches a cost per unit exergy of 0.249 $/kWh. This variable denotes a substantial decrease of 81.42 % compared to the power generation operational mode.

Hence, with the experimental method, this research invited the respondents to participate in an information stimulation experiment for verification. According to the results, individuals with single labeling stimulus have higher environmental subjective norms than those without labeling stimulus, while individuals with self-labeling stimulus have stronger environmental subjective norms than those with social labeling stimulus; individuals with labeling combination stimulus have higher environmental subjective norms than those with single labeling stimulus, while individuals received self-labeling before social labeling stimulus have stronger environmental subjective norm than those received social labeling before self-labeling stimulus. This research contributes to a theoretical perspective by (1) dividing labeling theory into stimuli and awareness, (2) explaining the relationship between self-consciousness and social responsibility from the perspective of social influence, (3) explaining how social labeling and self-labeling work, and (4) describing how self-awareness contributes to the development of individual knowledge. Moreover, this study suggests that designing corresponding advertising information strategies for each labeling stimulus can enhance people's environmental subjective norms.

This paper constructs a GTD evaluation system from the perspective of prevention and governance at the source, in terms of carbon reduction, pollution reduction, green expansion and growth, and measures the GTD performance of 281 cities based on the EW-TOPSIS model. It is found that the average increase in GTD of the sample cities from 2006 to 2020 is 3.40 %, the GTD progress of the 281 cities has a considerable positive spatial autocorrelation, with the GTD progress of the CETS pilot cities being significantly bigger than that of the non-pilot cities. Further this paper adopts the spatial difference model (S-DID) to scientifically identify the influence mechanism and heterogeneity of the direct and spatial effects of CETS on city GTD, and the results show that CETS has a positive effect on the GTD of both local and neighboring cities. Propensity score matching (PSM) is used to further corroborate these findings. The study also shows that CETS improves local GTD by promoting green innovation, rationalizing industrial structures, and enhancing energy efficiency in cities. Nevertheless, the ensuing siphon effect hinders nearby cities' levels of energy efficiency, industrial structure rationalization, and green innovation. The policy effects of CETS are more significant in large cities, eastern cities, old industrial areas, and non-resource-based cities. CETS can work in synergy with smart city construction, low-carbon city pilot policies, and emission trading policies to accelerate the process of GTD.

Therefore, climate-smart irrigation and nutrient management strategies are essential for sustainable fodder maize seed production systems. To address this research gap, climate-smart irrigation and nutrient management strategies were evaluated to reduce the environmental impact, increase profitability, reach carbon neutrality, and to achieve sustainable development goals such as improving energy productivity (SDG 7) and reductions in CO2 emissions (SDG 13) by 2030 to achieve global climate goals. The results from this study revealed that direct renewable resources were the major contributors to overall carbon (72.37%) and energy (24.77%) consumptions. Moderate irrigation at 50% depletion saved 19.11% energy and 26.11% carbon inputs by conserving water, fossil fuels, and manpower and was found to be more energy efficient (21.5% higher), less energy intensive (42.36 MJ US$−1), and with the lowest carbon footprint (0.34 kg CE kg−1 grain) over full irrigation. The adequate nutrients (Nitrogen 120: Phosphorus 60: Potassium 40 + Zinc 20 kg ha−1) resulted in improved energy use efficiency (6.24), carbon efficiency (16.02), and overall biomass yield (13.29 t ha−1). Therefore, the combination of climate-smart 50% deficit irrigation and adequate nutrients had a higher energy profitability (6.69), carbon output (86 486 kg ha−1), carbon efficiency (18.11), and carbon sustainability index (17.11).

The estimation of substitution impacts relies on a host of market assumptions, such as which products are substituted and to what extent. This study introduces a systematic framework for identifying the existence and rate of substitution based on microeconomic theory and econometric analysis. Four datasets and two theoretical models were applied for a set of empirical model formulations, including OLS in first differences, autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL), vector error correction model (VECM), and linear approximate almost ideal demand system (LA-AIDS). The selection of empirical models was informed by tests for non-stationarity, cointegration, autocorrelation, multicollinearity, normality and heteroskedasticity. The results point to regenerated cellulosic fibers (RCFs) being imperfect substitutes for cotton with an empirical substitution ratio of 32–46%, and mostly independent from the demand for polyester with an empirical substitution ratio of 0–13%. That is, a unit increase in the supply of RCFs substitutes every second to every third unit of cotton, while substitution of synthetics for RCFs is unlikely. This changes the marginal substitution impact of RCFs from net avoided fossil emission of 2.17 tCO2eq./t to a net caused fossil emission of 0.29 tCO2eq./t, on average. The effect of adopting an empirical substitution ratio is twofold: the substitution benefit remains lower due to imperfect substitution, while the rest of the additional supply contributes to expanding the aggregate market instead of substituting alternatives.

Carbon capture power plants (CCPPs) and wind power generation will play a significant role in this eco-friendly transformation. However, the high energy consumption of CCPPs and the anti-peak regulation characteristics of wind power lead to contradictions in their coordinated operation during peak shaving, restricting the system's low-carbon economic development. Aiming at the above challenges, an interval optimization method is proposed to coordinate wind power and CCPPs. Firstly, a flexible operation model of CCPPs is established, and the coordinated scheduling mechanism of wind power joint carbon capture operation and load-side demand response is introduced to optimize the system carbon emission through low carbon scheduling on both sides of the source and load. Secondly, interval numbers are used to manage the uncertainty of wind power output, and the interval-optimized scheduling model of wind power combined CCPPs is established. To solve the proposed model, the improved interval possibility method is adopted to transform the uncertain model into a deterministic one, which is solved by the CPLEX solver. Finally, the simulation outcomes using the IEEE 30-bus system framework reveal that the proposed approach significantly enhances the coordination between CCPPs and wind power. Notably, when compared to scenarios that solely focus on CCPPs, the proposed method achieves a substantial reduction in total costs by 16.67 % and decreases carbon emissions by 26.53 %. This sets a significant reference for low-carbon economic dispatch within power systems, providing key insights and foundational guidelines for future implementations, as well as novel strategies and technological support for the sustainable transformation of the power system towards lower carbon emissions.

As the public sector has demonstrated a lack of sufficient funds in numerous instances, promoting the Public-Private Partnership (PPP) has become a promising pathway toward green transportation. However, the role that PPP investments in the transportation sector in reducing transport CO2 emissions (TCO2e) on the road to meeting the sustainable development goals (SDGs) has received minimal attention. In this context, this study investigates the impact of PPP in the transportation sector and renewable energy on TCO2e for Mexico from 1990 to 2022, while controlling economic and urban settlement growth. For a novel attempt, this study leverages several modern econometric methodologies, such as the Augmented and Dynamic ARDL which allows estimating long-run and short-run elasticities vis-à-vis future scenario analysis. Results divulge that the PPP in transport curbs TCO2e over the short term, but the long-term effect is insignificant. Moreover, findings uncover that while the usage of renewable energy strengthens environmental circumstances, a rise in the urban population has a short-term negative impact on TCO2e. Moreover, the economic progress boosts Mexico's TCO2e and has a more devastating long-term effect, which is contradictory to the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. The current study suggests that in order to advance the nation's green transportation system, authorities in Mexico should implement several measures to increase the pie of renewable energy and effective public-private partnership investment in the transportation sector.

However, due to the high SP installation cost and high electricity prices faced by shipping operators, the utilization rate of SP is still low. For the government, it is important and urgent to develop an effective policy to promote shore power usage. However, previous studies have not compared the effects of different government policies and have ignored the differences in SP usage stages. Therefore, in this study, three kinds of policies, subsidy, carbon tax and shipper green awareness improvement, are taken into consideration. The SP usage process is divided into two stages, namely, stimulating ship retrofitting for SP in the short term and sustaining SP usage in the long run. The purpose of this study is to provide policy-selection suggestions for short- and long-term SP promotion. Considering shipping supply chain competition, game theory is applied, and a series of Nash game models are formulated to investigate the equilibrium strategies of shipping operators on SP usage under different policies. A comparison of the results reveals that in the short run, the subsidy policy is superior to the carbon tax policy when both can promote SP usage. However, a moderate carbon tax is able to remedy the failure of subsidies. In the long run, a carbon tax may promote SP at the cost of diminishing social welfare. Improving shipper green awareness is more likely to be a preferable choice for both SP usage and social welfare. This paper also analyses the impacts of scale-based port congestion and green awareness. These findings can provide valuable suggestions for government and shipping operators to promote SP usage, reduce emissions and achieve the goal of green port construction.

This research paper aims to tackle the supplier selection problem in a multi-period, multi-sourced, and multi-product environment by creating a process that places the manufacturer at the centre. Firstly, this paper has constructed a multi-period supplier dynamic preference model that takes into account environmental protection, to minimise the total cost and carbon emissions. Secondly, the Taguchi method is extended to the supplier selection problem in the field of quality engineering. The parameter optimisation process is then designed based on the Taguchi method, aiming to optimise the main key parameters that affect supplier selection and determine the optimisation level combinations upon which the model is solved. Finally, the model's feasibility and evolution are verified through examples of its application. The paper's methodology enhances the model's relevant parameters' robustness, augments decision-making efficiency, and offers suppliers guidance to boost their performance and substantially cut the manufacturer's total procurement expenditure and carbon dioxide emissions.

However, due to the high SP installation cost and high electricity prices faced by shipping operators, the utilization rate of SP is still low. For the government, it is important and urgent to develop an effective policy to promote shore power usage. However, previous studies have not compared the effects of different government policies and have ignored the differences in SP usage stages. Therefore, in this study, three kinds of policies, subsidy, carbon tax and shipper green awareness improvement, are taken into consideration. The SP usage process is divided into two stages, namely, stimulating ship retrofitting for SP in the short term and sustaining SP usage in the long run. The purpose of this study is to provide policy-selection suggestions for short- and long-term SP promotion. Considering shipping supply chain competition, game theory is applied, and a series of Nash game models are formulated to investigate the equilibrium strategies of shipping operators on SP usage under different policies. A comparison of the results reveals that in the short run, the subsidy policy is superior to the carbon tax policy when both can promote SP usage. However, a moderate carbon tax is able to remedy the failure of subsidies. In the long run, a carbon tax may promote SP at the cost of diminishing social welfare.

However, affected by the evolution of international political and economic situation, China has issued a coal ban on Australian coal since the end of 2020. The potential environmental consequences of this coal ban remain unclear. So, this paper quantifies the ban's impact on air pollution, human health and climate change by simulating the emission difference between the port scenario (simulating the emissions due to Australian coal import under business as usual) and the mine scenario (simulating the emissions due to domestic coal mining that converted from import share of Australian coal), and monetizes the losses into economic costs for direct comparison. The results illustrate the emission of SO2, VOCs and GHG in mine scenario grows up to 102, 12 and 6 times the amount of that in port scenario, mainly deriving from coal mining process in the North China Plain and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. It shows that the potential alternative of replacing import with mining leads to PM2.5 pollution exacerbation and O3 pollution abatement, which causes 148 (95 % CI: 101–183) non-communicable diseases and respiratory disease-related deaths in total. As for GHG, the emission of BC in transportation process and fugitive methane in coal mining process contribute to an impressive effect on warming potential with few quantities, which is worth noting in control process. In total, the environmental deterioration resulted in an economic loss of approximately 934 million yuan. The undiminished demand for high-quality industrial coal as well as growing carbon tax could make the economic value of the coal ban's environmental consequences more considerable in the near future. This research emphasizes the contradiction between economic development and environmental improvement caused by excessive dependence on coal and addresses a critical knowledge gap in assessing the ban's environmental impact by economic value. The result directly demonstrates the environmental consequences of the potential mining-replacing-import alternative and helps better understand environmental influences on the Chinese government's decision.

Simultaneously, some OEMs have launched personal carbon credit activities to attract sales. The impacts of different leaders reducing carbon emissions and OEMs providing carbon credits have been rarely discussed. This study considers a low-carbon supply chain consisting of one OEM and one supplier to explore the optimal operational strategies for when personal carbon credits are (not) offered and the supplier or OEM determines the carbon emission reduction level (CERL). First, we find that the CERL is higher without OEMs offering carbon credits. Specifically, the optimal CERL is higher if it is determined by the OEM when the OEM’s sharing rate of the carbon emission cost is small; otherwise, a higher CERL can be achieved by the supplier setting the CERL. Second, both the supplier and OEM can maximize their profits if they decide on the CERL by themselves. When the supplier sets the CERL, offering carbon credits is more like a bargaining tool for the OEM. Finally, a greater carbon emission reduction can be achieved when the OEM does not offer carbon credits. However, the behavior of OEM providing carbon credits can benefit the environment when the product’s original carbon emissions are relatively high, as lower total product emissions can be obtained under this scenario.

Hebei, as a major energy province in China, has more challenging carbon peaking and carbon neutrality targets. Based on the extended STIRPAT model, this paper evaluates the time to peak carbon and post-peak carbon trend changes in Hebei province under different scenarios from 2020 to 2060. Based on the support vector machine model with particle swarm optimization, this paper evaluates the carbon neutral pathways under different scenarios in Hebei province from 2020 to 2060 in terms of forests, croplands, wetlands, grasslands and Carbon Capture, Utilization and Storage (CCUS). The results show that a monotonically flat trend without inflection point, a single-inflection-point plateau-period trend and a multi-inflection-point inverted U-wave trend occur after carbon peaks. Hebei Province can achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 under the policy scenario and the enhanced scenario, and the enhanced scenario is better. Comparing with existing studies, the innovation of this paper is to design different trends of changes after carbon peak, combining carbon absorption and carbon emission, and providing more diversified development paths for carbon neutral strategies through a more integrated perspective and multi-scenario comprehensive analysis. Therefore, In the future, Hebei Province should establish a platform for carbon emissions monitoring and carbon footprint assessment, and set up an early warning and assessment mechanism for carbon peaking, so as to prevent a rebound trend in carbon emissions after peaking. At the same time, it should introduce and develop carbon capture and conversion technologies and promote the low-carbon transformation of the industrial and energy sectors, thereby forcing the early realization of peak carbon. Pay attention to the role of forestry resources in carbon neutrality, increase carbon sink resources such as forests and wetlands, promote the development of CCUS, and enhance the implementation of the policy.

Accurate prediction of surface CO2 emissions in these areas is crucial for understanding combustion zones and contributes to the global net zero carbon strategy. Traditional data analysis methods have been inadequate for CO2 flux prediction, highlighting the necessity for advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. This study introduces four optimized ML models—General Regression Neural Networks (GRNNs) and Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNNs) coupled with Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)—to rapidly predict CO2 flux in areas affected by underground coal fires. Utilizing 223 field test samples, these models consider six key variables: soil temperature at 30 cm depth (ST-30), ambient pressure/temperature/humidity (AP/AT/AH), soil water content (SWC), and wind speed (A-WS). The results underscore the superior predictive accuracy of the GRNN model, with an RMSE of 0.074 and an R2 of 0.9995. Sensitivity analysis reveals A-WS and ST-30 as the most influential factors. Compared to traditional methods, these ML models demonstrate enhanced accuracy and efficiency, marking a significant advancement in the field. The study's findings have broader applications beyond underground coal fires, suggesting potential for these ML models in other environmental monitoring contexts, such as emissions tracking in urban areas or integration with satellite data for global environmental assessment. This methodology represents a pivotal step in environmental management and monitoring, offering scalable and adaptable solutions for various ecological challenges.

In response to this gap, this study constructs and gauges the carbon footprint pressure (CFP) index of the Yangtze River Delta region over the period 2000–2020. Moreover, a comprehensive approach combining a modified gravity model, social network analysis, and the STIRPAT model is employed to systematically explore the evolution characteristics and effects of spatial correlations of CFP.

However, a growing body of recent studies has challenged the often-assumed notion that electric vehicles are often considered to be net-zero emissions. These studies suggest that electric vehicles could potentially generate substantial emissions due to their reliance on fossil fuels to generate electricity, especially when receiving fast charging services. This phenomenon has been mitigated with the use of renewable energy sources in the power system. However, due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy sources, additional requirements have arisen. To address this situation, this paper presents an interdisciplinary study of collaborative fast-charging stations (FCS) and distributed renewable energy planning based on the interactions between traffic and power networks in order to increase the adoption rate of electric vehicles and reduce emissions caused by traffic and power systems. The locations and sizing of fast-charging stations, distributed photovoltaic generation, and renewable energy power supply for electric vehicles are determined in the proposed strategy through multi-objective integer programming. The proposed planning strategy considers heterogeneous electric vehicle driving range constraints, the operation security of the power distribution system, the reliability and expansion of the current power distribution, as well as different types of air pollutant classifications resulting from the charging behaviors. To guarantee the feasibility and accuracy of the planning results, an interactive algorithm is applied to solve the multi-objective integer model.

While it may bring about transnational carbon emission transfers, it begs the question: does it promote carbon reduction in a country's agricultural sector? Such an inquiry holds profound implications for optimizing agricultural trade and promoting low-carbon agricultural advancement. Utilizing two-way fixed effect model, mediating effect model and dual-fixed spatial Durbin model, this paper examines the impact effects, mechanisms and spatial characteristics of agricultural trade openness (ATO) on agricultural carbon reduction using panel data from Chinese provinces spanning 2000 to 2021.

It serves critical roles in shipping, maritime development, and national defense, which contributes significantly to employment, international trade, and national security. Nevertheless, the shipbuilding industry is under enormous pressure to curtail carbon emissions. The International Maritime Organization (IMO) requires a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from both existing and new ships by 2030 compared to the 2008 baseline. This stems from the industry's high-carbon emission nature, making it imperative to adopt sustainable solutions that minimize its environmental impact. Given the capital- and energy-intensive nature of the shipbuilding industry, the implementation of suitable technologies can also improve the overall operational efficiency while meeting shipowners' sustainability standards and enhancing competitiveness. We selected a typical shipbuilding company in South China and categorized the 11 key low-carbon technologies into four categories based on their principles and application scenarios, i.e., equipment improvement, process upgrading, intelligent upgrading, and fuel alternative. The Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning system (LEAP) model was employed in this study to simulate the energy consumption structure of this shipbuilding enterprise and explore pathways to reach carbon emissions peak under six low-carbon technology scenarios. In addition, the impact of dynamically changing grid emission factors on long-term carbon emission reduction is taken into consideration. The results show that a sustained reduction in grid emission factors will have a positive impact on carbon emission reduction. The shipyard's planned requirements to achieve carbon peak before 2030 and reduce its carbon intensity by 18% from 2020 are only achievable under the application of all low-carbon technologies. The shipyard will achieve carbon peak in 2026, with a maximum emission reduction potential of 13.2 thousand tons. The primary contributors are equipment improvement and process upgrading technologies, with reductions of 6.73 and 3.11 thousand tons, respectively. Therefore, from a technical point of view, these can be prioritized for development, although some of the equipment has a high upfront investment. Notably, the technology diffusion is rapid, with most technologies projected to reach penetration saturation by 2025, leading to a payback period of 3–4 years thereafter.

Then, the Virginia Tech microscopic model was used to perform traffic emission spatiotemporal analysis. In the experiments, trajectory repair results indicate that Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Error are 1.1299m and 0.7816m within 3s, which has excellent prediction accuracy and provides a reliable data basis for accurately estimating emissions. Emission results show that vehicle speed and acceleration are positively correlated with emissions, with the highest emissions generated during acceleration, of which CO could reach 0.0037 g/s. From a temporal perspective, emissions gradually decrease during red light phases and increase when vehicles accelerate during green light phases, suggesting recommendations for signal optimization for areas where emissions exceed standards to reduce vehicle's start and stop. From a spatial perspective, emission rates are highest in the downstream area, with CO reaching more than 0.0043 g/s. It can be suggested that relevant authorities could install speed limit signs or plant trees in this area. Overall, these findings have the potential to alleviate emission pressures at intersections.

This study investigates the impact of the digital economy on urban total factor productivity and carbon emissions, as well as its mechanism, from 2011 to 2019 by developing a digital economy evaluation index system. We find that the growth of the digital economy can increase urban total factor productivity while lowering carbon emissions and also has a significant spatial spillover effect on regional economic growth, energy conservation, and emissions reduction. The main influencing mechanism is that the digital economy accelerates marketization by encouraging industrial structure upgrades and technological progress, which results in higher total factor productivity and lower energy consumption. In terms of the spatial distribution, the digital economy promotes total factor productivity more in the central and western regions and large cities and promotes carbon emission reduction less in the eastern regions and smaller cities. The findings extend the benefits of the digital economy beyond economic and social welfare benefits and serve as a model for achieving a win–win situation in terms of both economic growth and carbon emissions reduction.

Analyzing the role of industrial structure and digital finance ";" As China enters the process of agricultural modernization, the problem of carbon emissions from agricultural sectors has become increasingly prominent, and the government and academia urgently need to take action. In this context, this study extends the literature through a new perspective of China's financial agglomeration construction that examines the actual role of financial agglomeration on agricultural carbon emissions reduction by using two-way fixed effect model and threshold effect model based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China from 2011 to 2019. Data statistics show that China has formed a multi-center development pattern with Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta, Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao as highly financial agglomeration under the influence of different locations, factor endowments and development foundations. Further empirical model estimates reveal the following main findings. Firstly, the effects of financial agglomeration on total agricultural carbon intensity (TACI), agricultural greenhouse gas carbon intensity (AGCI), agricultural energy carbon emission intensity (AECI), and agricultural input factors carbon intensity (ASCI) show an inverted U-shaped curve that from irritating to inhibiting. That is, financial agglomeration is conducive to slowing down agricultural carbon emissions. Secondly, financial agglomeration has a significant inhibitory effect on TACI, AGCI, AECI and ASCI in Beijing and Shanghai. Thirdly, when the industrial structure is more reasonable or the digital finance is more developed, the effect of financial agglomeration on reducing agricultural carbon emissions is stronger. Based on the current research results, promoting the construction of financial agglomeration is an effective way to promote agricultural carbon emissions reduction, and it is suggested that the government design effective systems and policies to slow down the carbon emissions in the agricultural sector.

However, residential buildings' daily operation not only consumes enormous energy, but emits relatively elevated CO2, which runs counter to energy saving and emission reduction. Consequently, it's urgent to acquire a more environmentally-friendly and efficient system for residential buildings. To solve this problem, a novel trigeneration system based on solid oxide fuel cell is proposed, integrating cooling, heating, electricity supply, and energy storage. Firstly, the system's mathematical model is established and the influence of key parameters on the system's performance is analyzed. Then, the genetic algorithm is utilized to optimize parameters of waste heat recovery system. Finally, the novel system is applied to satisfy energy demands of residential buildings, and five energy supply options are proposed to compare with the original option in terms of economy and environment. Numerical results show that among the five options, Option 3 has the best economy, with a payback period of 5.54 years and the total cost is 65.33% lower than the original option.

In this study, the mechanical properties of a SCP were analyzed through field tests and numerical simulations and the optimal arrangement of the SCP group was obtained. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions during the construction process of the SCP group were calculated by considering three aspects: material consumption, mechanical requirements, and labor consumption. The results were then evaluated and compared with those of the traditional bored cast-in-place pile (BCP) group. It was found that the optimal arrangement of ground treatment with the SCP group was determined with a pile having an inner core diameter of 500 mm, an outer diameter of 700 mm and pile spacing of 2.8 m, which is four times the pile outer diameter. Compared to the BCP group, the SCP group has advantages of 6.16 % reductions GHG emissions of building materials, 42.76 % that of mechanical usage, and 53.11 % that of labor consumption. The final settlement of pile groups exhibits a clear negative correlation with their GHG emissions. The variation in GHG emissions is primarily dependent on changes in pile spacing, while the effect of the inner core pile diameter is relatively minor. The scientific significance of this study is rooted in the quantitative evaluation and comparison of GHG emissions during the construction phase of two different types of pile foundations. It also elucidates the interplay between the load-bearing capacity of SCP group and their GHG emissions. This study can serve as a crucial reference for the design and construction of foundation engineering, ensuring that pile foundation construction aligns with both the requisite load-bearing performance and low-carbon construction standards.

Also, the impact of adopting solar photovoltaics (PV) based hybrid power systems on overall CO2 emissions from operation of telecom towers. Optimal designs of solar PV-based hybrid systems are obtained using HOMER software for 25 diverse Indian locations for powering both 4G and 5G telecom towers while considering site-specific factors such as solar resource availability, availability and tariff of grid electricity and the unit price of diesel used in the Diesel Generator (DG) of the hybrid system. From the results of the study it is noted that, with the current energy supply mix, a tripling of the carbon dioxide emissions is expected if all of India's 0.71 million telecom towers adopt 5G technology. Adoption of solar PV-based systems along with grid electricity and diesel generator in hybrid mode has the potential to reduces carbon dioxide emissions by approximately 55 % for the existing telecom towers in India. For the case of all telecom towers transitioning to 5G technology, about 58 % reduction in CO2 emissions is possible with the adoption of PV-based hybrid power systems. From the perspective of the unit cost of CO2 emissions mitigation, the adoption of solar PV-based hybrid systems is found to be a no regret option.

To meet this challenge, several strategies have been proposed to improve the production process and reduce the environmental impact. In the present research work, the simulation of a steam generation plant with different fuels (heavy fuel oil, natural gas, and biogas) will be performed from a Tequila producer located in Valles region, Jalisco. The innovation of the research work focuses on the presentation of a new alternative for evaluating the environmental impact of the food industry focused on the process and its interaction with the environment. To calculate the environmental impacts associated with each of the proposed alternatives, a simulation of the industrial process (Production 50,000 L/day of Tequila) was carried out using CHEMCAD® simulation software and ALOHA® software. The simulation consisted in 6 steam generation boilers, which were represented by a Gibbs reactor in an adiabatic operation with an outlet temperature of 2032 °C, being fed with air and fuel. The outlet of the reactor was connected to a heat exchanger in which the combustion gases were in contact with a stream of water. The calculations were based on the generation of 12,000 kg/h of steam which are distributed to the extraction (17.07°%), hydrolysis (22.14°%) and distillation (60.79°%) stages for Tequila production process. From combustion, gases were quantified at the exit of the chimney. It is concluded that the use of natural gas is the most environmentally friendly option with gasses emission of 284.87 Ton/year of NO, 0.26 Ton/year of NO2, 358.98 Ton/year of CO, 11337.71 Ton/year of CO2, and 1.73 Ton/year of SO2. Finally, using as an environmental indicator the emissions of kg/L of CO2 coming from Tequila produced (heavy fuel oil 0.82, natural gas 0.62, and biogas 0.73), it is concluded that the change of fuel to natural gas represents a 24°% decrease in greenhouse effect emissions, presenting itself as an effective sustainability strategy to be applied in the Agave-Tequila production chain.

In this study, effect of five mixture formation methods including Homogeneous charge, In-cylinder mildly stratified charge, In-cylinder severely stratified charge, Spark-plug mildly stratified charge, and Spark-plug severely stratified charge were studied on efficiency combustion, emissions, and energy distribution. The results show that equivalent combustion obtained the maximum hydrogen consumption and nitrogen oxide emissions exceeded 2900 ppm for all mixture formation methods. For light and medium lean burn conditions (λ = 1.6, 2.2, 2.7), Spark-plug severely stratified charge and In-cylinder severely stratified charge methods balanced combustion stability and thermal efficiency, but also maintained nitrogen oxide emissions to at least over 100 ppm. While at ultra-lean burn conditions (λ = 3.2 and 3.6), all methods limited nitrogen oxide emissions to less than 10 ppm. In addition, at λ = 3.62, Spark-plug mildly stratified charge method significantly reduced the coefficient of variation on Pmax by about 7 %. Compared to the In-cylinder severely stratified charge method with λ = 1, Spark-plug mildly stratified charge method with λ = 3.62 reduced hydrogen consumption by 75.8 g/(kW × h). The energy distribution proved that this reduction was attributed to the reduction of heat loss power from lean burn and a further limitation of exhaust power from Spark-plug mildly stratified charge method, which was considered to be the most promising method to achieve clean, efficient and stable combustion.

Currently, high-quality carbon emission factors and calculation methods that identify the sources of CEs from construction process are lacking. This study proposed a process-based method for calculating on-site construction CEs and empirically demonstrated its feasibility using a case of a multistory steel structure with typical column-beam systems. Six construction processes comprising 38 subprocesses were first categorized, then the energy and materials consumed for each subprocess were determined to obtain the first-hand CE parameters. The CEs from hoisting the first- and second-section columns were 10.52 kgCO2/column and 14.41 kgCO2/column, respectively, and the CEs from their installation were in the range 38.16–69.18 kgCO2/column. The CEs from hoisting the primary and secondary beams using a car crane were 7.73 kgCO2/beam and 4.52 kgCO2/beam, respectively, with lower CEs of 2.40 kgCO2/beam and 2.22 kgCO2/beam, respectively when a tower crane was used for hoisting. The 14 connection types used to install the primary beams and the 11 connection types used to install the secondary beams had CEs of 13.84–125.96 kgCO2/beam and 10.39–43.49 kgCO2/beam, respectively. The total on-site construction CE was subsequently calculated by summing the CEs from each process. This method was able to track the CE sources for each construction process and their contributions to identify those with high CE intensities. In addition, the case study was evaluated to provide specific feedback on the current national standard for calculating CEs from building construction.

First, based on the model, this paper focuses on the impacts of a single carbon tax policy, a single emission reduction subsidy policy, and a mixture of the two on the economic and environmental quality of the textile industry. Subsequently, the transmission mechanism of the textile industry environmental policy is analyzed, and the optimization suggestions for the effect of China's textile industry policy are put forward. The results suggest that a moderate carbon tax policy can effectively restrain carbon emissions, an excessive one can hinder the industrial economy, and carbon subsidies have the opposite effect. The policy combination of high carbon tax and low subsidy can improve environmental quality in a short time. In contrast, low carbon tax and high subsidies can help to achieve economic development goals. Finally, this study proposes that combining industrial production and pollution emissions and dynamically adjusting the combination of policy tools can enhance the effectiveness of environmental protection policies in the textile industry and realize an actual “win-win” situation regarding environmental quality improvement and economic growth.

Empirical findings from the augmented mean group and novel dynamic common correlated effects mean group estimator reveal that the strongest long-term escalation in carbon dioxide emissions is attributable to final energy consumption, followed by energy security risk.

In this study, we use multi-regional input-output (MRIO) and scenario analyses to investigate the carbon spillover effects of urbanization, industrial shifting, and their synergy effect on provincial and sectoral carbon emissions in China during 2012–2017. The results showed that urbanization in China further increased carbon spillover in the provinces that already have a high spillover.

Safe transportation of carbon dioxide (CO2) to offshore storage and injection facilities is one of the prerequisites to ensuring safe CCUS operation.

However, saturation errors in NTL data are believed to limit the accuracy of the application. Therefore, this study compared the desaturation ability and the effect of spatializing CO2 emissions in China based on five saturation correction methods of Letu + Tong, SARMRC (the saturation correction method based on a regression model and radiance-calibrated NTL data), VANUI (index-based vegetation adjusted NTL urban index), EANTLI (enhanced vegetation index (EVI)-adjusted NTL index) and LERNCI (land surface temperature (LST)-and-EVI-regulated-NTL-city index). Based on this, we explored the influence of saturation correction on the spatialization of CO2 emissions. The main findings of this study include: (1) The saturation correction effect is limited by the bias of the NTL image itself in some regions, the auxiliary data, and the regional differences of the fitting models, which fail to reach the best effect in spatializing CO2 emissions at the provincial level. However, as downscaling to the prefectural level, the Letu + Tong image with the advantage of desaturation has a better effect on spatializing CO2 emissions.

Therefore, it is crucial to explore how to diffuse CCUS technology. Under the guidance of considering the carbon trading mechanism, this paper establishes a tripartite evolutionary game model of thermal power enterprises-government-public, discusses the evolutionary stability of each stakeholder and the dynamic evolution process of the system; then the simulation parameters are determined by the optimal power generation decision-making model based on Gounod's equilibrium; finally, the system dynamics (SD) model based on the evolutionary game is used for the simulation of the system's evolution paths, and the sensitivity analyses of the important parameters are carried out. The conclusions of the study are as follows: (1) Currently, the diffusion of CCUS technology in China is in the development stage, corresponding to the system equilibrium state of {investment, no incentives, no participation}, i.e., investment by thermal power generating enterprises, no incentives from the government, and no participation from the public. (2) The carbon trading market has guidance for the deployment of CCUS technology, and an appropriate reduction of carbon allowances and an increase in the unit price of carbon trading can stimulate the willingness of thermal power enterprises to invest in CCUS technology. (3) The choice of equilibrium strategy for thermal power enterprises is influenced by parameters and other stakeholders' initial strategies. Lower investment costs, higher carton emission reduction efficiency, moderate increases in penalties and subsidies, as well as a higher probability of government incentives and public participation in monitoring will increase the probability of thermal power enterprises investing in CCUS technology, and facilitate the evolution of the developmental stage {Investment, No incentive, No participation} to the ideal stage {Investment, Incentive, Participation}.

Based on the LEAP framework, this study established a transport CO2 and atmospheric pollutant emission analysis model for Chengdu from 2021 to 2040, set up three main scenarios for the study of carbon peaking trend and 12 sub-scenarios for the study of the synergistic effect of various emission reduction measures. In addition, the synergistic effects were analyzed by radar charts, grading charts of synergistic effects and the synergetic equivalence index. The results show that under the Green Scenario (GS) and the Strengthen Green Scenario (SGS), the CO2 emissions from comprehensive transportation in Chengdu will peak at 26.774 × 106 t and 23.507 × 106 t in 2032 and 2029, respectively. The emissions of other atmospheric pollutants show a general downward trend. Under SGS, The measures that play the greatest role in reducing CO2, CO, VOCs, and NOx emissions by 2040 are NEV (New energy conversion of vehicles), Among them, the CO2 emission reduction rate relative to BS scenario is 20.7%. While the measures that play the greatest role in reducing PM and SO2 emissions are IES (Improvement of emission standards) and SRT (Strengthen railway transportation), respectively. Compared with other measures, the synergistic effect of SRT is the most highest. The emission reduction effect of NEV is most significant, with a synergistic effect level above level II. Under the joint regulation of multiple measures by GS and SGS, the synergistic equivalence index based on air quality standards has been effectively controlled, showing a downward trend. Overall, Chengdu faces challenges due to a large number of motor vehicles and air passenger throughput. Therefore, vigorously developing hydrogen vehicles and electric vehicles, strengthening railway construction in Chengdu, transferring the pressure of civil aviation and road transportation to railway, can make significant contributions to the pollution reduction and carbon reduction of Chengdu's transportation sector.

This study aims to examine whether AI-based models can identify key operational processes of a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) facility and predict the emission of target air pollutants, including nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfur oxides (SOx), and total suspended particles (TSP). First, key operational variables are selected based on the feature importance of the Random Forest models (that is, data-driven input selection). Secondly, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-based AutoEncoder (BiLSTM-AE) and Random Forest (RF) models with the data-driven input selection are trained and evaluated using multiple predictive performance metrics. Then, the BiLSTM-AE and RF models are trained and evaluated using the operational variables selected by experts. Results demonstrate that the data-driven and expertise-based methods select five common operational variables that are key factors to predict variations of target output variables. The results from the multi-metric evaluations show a skillful prediction of BiLSTM-AE and RF models for NOx and TSP, but not SOx. For TSP prediction, RF is more sensitive to the input selection method than BiLSTM-AE. This study underscores the dependency of the prediction skill of AI algorithm-based models on the target air pollutant and input selection method, and suggests the trustworthiness of selected key operational variables by RF's feature importance.";"2024-01-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624002531";"3";"Emissions"

This research develops a game theoretical model to examine the phenomenon of manufacturer encroachment in the context of carbon emission reduction and asymmetric information. Our analysis reveals that when the manufacturer does not encroach, a reduction in carbon emissions benefits all members of the supply chain. However, under encroachment, only the manufacturer stands to benefit from the reduction in carbon emissions. Moreover, with a low direct selling cost, we recommend that the manufacturer should aim to achieve a lower level of carbon emissions under encroachment compared to non-encroachment scenarios. Another key finding is that the benefits of encroachment for the manufacturer depend on the relative costs of direct selling and carbon emission reduction. Encroachment is advantageous to the manufacturer when either the direct selling cost or the carbon emission reduction cost is low. On the other hand, encroachment benefits the retailer only when both the direct selling cost and the carbon emission reduction cost are high. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is in the retailer’s best interest to voluntarily share demand information with the manufacturer, particularly when the direct selling cost is either low or high. By sharing demand information, the retailer can enhance the overall performance of the supply chain. Overall, this study provides valuable insights for managers regarding encroachment and carbon emission decisions in the context of low carbon manufacturing, carbon cap-and-trade policies, and asymmetric information. These findings can guide decision-making processes and help optimize the performance of supply chains in environmentally conscious settings.

The model specifically involves a manufacturer, a digital retailer, and a brick-and-mortar retailer, examining their optimal pricing and emission reduction decisions, as well as the extent of the bidirectional free-riding effect. The findings indicate that both the manufacturer's enhancement of emission reduction efforts and the retailers' amplification of their promotional endeavors result in increased prices and profits. The influence of a retailer's low-carbon reputation on the manufacturer's carbon reduction initiatives depends on the impact of the manufacturer's own emission reduction level on their efforts. Furthermore, due to the bidirectional free-riding phenomenon, the effect of the digital (brick-and-mortar) retailer's low-carbon reputation on the promotional efforts of the brick-and-mortar (digital) retailer relies on the influence of their own low-carbon reputation on their promotional initiatives. In addition, the bidirectional free-riding behavior of digital and brick-and-mortar retailers is closely associated with factors such as the coefficient of the retailer's promotional effort level, the coefficient of the retailer's promotional cost, the attenuation rate of low-carbon reputation, and other parameters.

To test that, here we study three decades of changes in air quality and urban renewal, including building composition and green space, in one of the largest and most rapidly-changing megacity clusters in China – the Pearl River Delta city cluster. Our results show that this region underwent substantial urban renewal, where more than 75% of all buildings were constructed over the past 30 years, and ∼25% of all buildings emerged within the last 10 years. We analyze the spatial-temporal dynamics of airborne particulate matter across the entire region, and compare it to patterns of regional urbanization. We find that increases in the number of buildings exacerbate air pollution, especially during winter. Although our results also suggest that green space helps improve regional air quality, its efficiency diminishes with increasing building age.

However, concerns about rent-seeking behavior hindering emissions reduction policies have arisen, as such policies can be costly. The presence of crony capitalism in countries is a significant concern in this regard, which unfortunately has not been considered a research gap. To investigate the impact of crony capitalism on CO2 emissions in 73 countries between 2000 and 2021, this study employed the innovative Method of Moment Quantile Regression (MM-QR). Four proxies for crony capitalism were used, including economic freedom, the International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) indicators, worldwide governance indicators, and a combined proxy of the three proxies aimed at reducing crony capitalism. The results indicated that all four proxies for crony capitalism significantly reduced CO2 emissions at different quantiles. The composite proxy was the most effective, while the ICRG proxy was the least effective. Additionally, all proxies except for the ICRG proxy had a greater impact on reducing CO2 emissions at high quantiles. Therefore, crony capitalism leads to an increase in CO2 emissions. The study confirmed the Kuznets curve and found that energy consumption and industrialization increase CO2 emissions, while higher energy prices and population reduce CO2 emissions.

While numerous studies have investigated grid parity for large-scale renewables, some have overlooked the fact that the integration of variable renewable energy requires coordination with regulating resources. This coordination introduces additional costs, leading to subsequent increases in electricity prices. Our study comprehensively considers the total system costs and proposes a dynamic recursive linear optimization model. This model aims to simulate both short-term and long-term impacts of constructing a new power system on electricity prices in China. It evaluates the short-term effects of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the COVID-19 pandemic on energy prices and demand, as well as the long-term effects of renewable energy penetration on ancillary service costs and technological progress on system costs. The results show that China's electricity price is projected to rise by 10.2% in 2030 for carbon peaking. By 2060, with an 83.3% renewable energy penetration for carbon neutrality, the electricity price will reach 0.859 CNY/kWh, representing a 27.2% increase. Ancillary service costs will experience the highest growth rate, accounting for 15.5% of system costs by 2060.

";" The stable introduction and utilization of foreign investment is a guarantee for China's further opening up, and plays a significant role in urban carbon emission reduction within the framework of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality strategies. By calculating the index of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) stability and utilizing panel data of 274 Chinese cities spanning from 2006 to 2019, this article systematically investigates the impact of FDI stability on urban carbon emissions. The results indicate that upgrading FDI stability can effectively reduce urban carbon emissions. This effect is particularly pronounced in cities with lower rationalization degree of industrial structure, higher financial investment in technology, higher foreign capital dependence and cities rely on resource-based industries. The upgrading of human capital structure, digital transformation and green technology innovation are the intermediary mechanism for FDI stability to have a carbon emission reduction effect. While the incentive effect of FDI stability on “independent innovation” is relatively lower compared to “imitation innovation”. Additionally, there is a delay in the impact of innovation quality and urban digital transformation. Further research suggests that stable FDI widens the carbon emission gap between regions, leading to an obvious “Matthew effect”, which could be effectively corrected by implementing reasonable environmental regulation and improving FDI quality.

Therefore, this study aims to determine the impact of GHG emissions, trade, and economic growth on the BE. To achieve this, we used a panel dataset of 25 selected countries surrounding the Indian Ocean, covering the period 2002–2019.

Investigating and assessing the NEEB could exhibit the suitability of different nitrogen management. In a two-year field experiment, the conventional nitrogen management (N180), NFR (25% nitrogen reduction based on N180), and OFS (25% N substituted with organic fertilizer based on N180) were compared under continuous flooding irrigation (CF) and alternating wet and dry irrigation (AWD). Both NFR and OFS showed significant reductions in NH3 volatilization (25.0% and 18.9%), GHG emissions (35.4% and 28.6%), and total N leaching and runoff (39.0% and 28.1%), compared to N180.

Similarly, OFS produced an identical NEEB (15.6 × 103 CNY ha- 1) as NFR due to the high cost of organic fertilizer in rice production. Furthermore, AWD irrigation showed better environmental and economic benefits than CF, reducing CH4 emissions and conserving irrigation water and electricity.

The carbon-tracing algorithms enable the independent system operator (ISO) to better manage and establish a fair pricing mechanism, considering the actual contribution of each plant to the network's total daily emissions. The ISO, by utilizing carbon-tracing analysis, can easily compute nodal carbon intensity and branchial carbon flow, which are used in nodal pricing analysis. Furthermore, in this paper, for motivating flexible consumers, especially those who have higher impacts on carbon emissions, a carbon-based incentive framework called the flexible carbon-responsive (FCR) program is established, which helps the consumers control their carbon output and enables the ISO to decrease the network's total carbon emissions. In the proposed structure, the worst-case scenarios, which arise from uncertain parameters, can easily affect the simulation results. As a result, in order to avoid such issues, analyzing risks associated with uncertainty is the next focus of this research, and the downside risk constraints (DRC) approach is used to accomplish so. The DRC technique helps the ISO achieve an appropriate balance between the cost associated with risk and the anticipated cost, with the simultaneous objective of minimizing overall risk. Last, a modified IEEE 24-bus transmission system and the IEEE 20-bus gas network are utilized to evaluate the suggested carbon-based pricing mechanism. The simulation results show that applying the FCR program and carbon-based pricing causes the total operation costs to decrease by 100%, resulting in an increase of only 0.71% under the proposed DRC method. It could be noted that the total operation cost increment in the with-carbon tax case is 0.18% lower compared to the no-carbon tax policy.

The Aerogel Glazing System (AGS) stands out as one of the most advanced glazing systems currently available. In order to evaluate the carbon-saving potential of AGS, the life cycle carbon emission model of AGS was established. The carbon emission of production, transportation, construction, operation, maintenance, and waste disposal are considered. The results showed that AGS has higher carbon-saving potential. The life cycle carbon emissions of AGS in commercial, double glazing system (DGS), triple glazing system (TGS) are −144.8 kg CO2/m2, 593.6 kg CO2/m2, 250.8 kg CO2/m2 in Beijing horizontal direction. Under high temperature supercritical drying (in Commercial), low temperature supercritical drying, and freeze-drying, the life carbon emissions of AGS are lower compared to both DGS and TGS. Then the life cycle carbon emissions of AGS in different climates were analyzed. The results show that the life cycle carbon emissions of AGS under different climatic conditions are as follows (in ascending order): subtropical climate < polar climate < temperate climate < arid climate < tropical climate, with a maximum of 4929.9 kg CO2/m2 and a minimum of −634.5 kg CO2/m2. The use of AGS in tropical climate produced 5.9 times increase in life carbon emissions compared to its use in subtropical climate. In the heating-dominated climate, AGS has the greatest potential for carbon savings when orientated southwards. In cooling dominated climates, the carbon emissions are higher in the southward direction, with a weaker potential for carbon savings. Interestingly, in polar and tropical climates, increasing the aerogel thickness layer effectively reduces the life cycle carbon emissions of AGS. This study provides valuable insights for selecting sustainable curtain wall systems and window configurations, offering a pathway to minimize environmental impacts.

As a knowledge area, the GE is continuously expanding, making it challenging for researchers to identify the latest trends, add to the relevant body of knowledge or forecast the impact technologies in industry. Industrial partners are seeking to adopt new GE concepts and implement GE technological development but find it difficult to identify and quantify relevant information. Systems thinking orientates around the quantification of all contributing factors and can provide structure to expanding research and technological adoption. The key challenge is identifying all the factors, subsystems, and systems in a quantitative approach. Therefore, this research expands on a two-tiered methodology, with the first tier adopting literature to develop expert knowledge in the GE. This expert knowledge is applied in the second-tier analysis to create quantifiable relations between all influencing variables advancing the GE. The results provide for comprehensive insights into all systems currently contributing towards the GE. The results quantify 9 systems with 96 elements. The quantified interaction strength between the systems and their elements on an intra-system and inter-system is provided.

An effective policy mix and synergy is crucial for achieving the emission reduction targets and for ensuring the effectiveness of the policies, and it is therefore of great practical importance to provide a pathway for policy synergy based on assessing policy effectiveness. This paper selects three policies, namely the carbon Emission Trading System (ETS), Coal Control and Clean Utilization (CCCU), and Green Financial Reform and Innovation Pilot Zone (GFPZ), sets up ten scenarios, adopts difference-in-differences (DID) models to evaluate the impact, and give a pathway for policy synergy. The results show that ETS, CCCU, and GFPZ policies have significant positive effects on carbon emission reduction, energy structure transformation, and industrial environmental pollution control, respectively; CCCU has synergistic effects with ETS and GFPZ policies in controlling coal consumption and increasing the completion of industrial pollution control investments, respectively; while GFPZ policies have conflicting effects with CCCU and ETS in reducing carbon emissions and coal consumption, the GFPZ policy has conflicting effects with CCCU and ETS in reducing carbon emissions and controlling coal consumption. Finally, the study proposes a phased policy support system around carbon emission reduction in the power generation industry, energy structure transformation, and industrial environmental pollution control before 2030 and from 2030 to 2060.

In this regard, the reduction of such emissions has become one of the main targets of economic planning for both developed and developing countries. Thus, this study determines whether economic growth and increased energy consumption can have a significant impact on CO2 emissions and whether this relationship is mutual, bidirectional, or unidirectional. For this purpose, we employ a panel autoregressive (VAR) model and focus on a group of developing countries in Southeast Asia in which their economic and population growth are expected to increase CO2 emissions in the future. Additionally, we examine their difficulties in meeting the CO2 emission targets and consider modern renewable energy sources (RES) in our quantitative research. Based on the results, there have been various rebound effects and rising expenses for modern RES in these countries, which have hampered their long-term goal of reducing CO2 emissions.

A low-pollution asphalt (TBD-A) was prepared with tourmaline, biochar, and diatomite (TBD). A testing and evaluation method for the emission reduction efficacy of TBD-A has been proposed. The road performance of TBD-A was evaluated based on DSR, MSCR, BBR, and LAS. The evolution law of the emission reduction effect of TBD-A was clarified. Based on DSC, FTIR, and TG, the improvement mechanism of the road performance and emission reduction mechanism of TBD-A were revealed. The results show that the high-temperature performance, creep recovery ability, and fatigue life of TBD-A increase with TBD content rising. The low-temperature performance of TBD-A is superior to that of asphalt slurry. Controlling the TBD content and temperature can ensure the excellent low-temperature performance of TBD-A. The emission reduction efficacy of TBD-A increases as temperature and adsorption time rise. The comprehensive emission reduction rate of TBD-rubber-powder asphalt is the highest, reaching 64% at 190 °C. TBD and asphalt are physically blended. TBD increases asphalt's glass transition temperature while decreasing the thermal decomposition rate. The temperature stability and sensitivity of asphalt have been improved.

Firms must estimate carbon allowances before determining the optimal environmental investment timing. Typically, firms prioritize environmental investments by introducing environmental equipment during the compliance cycle (ID) when their estimated carbon allowances are low. Conversely, they prefer to make environmental investments after the compliance cycle (IA) by purchasing carbon credits to offset excess emissions. This study aims to present a process and outcomes for firms to accurately select the timing of environmental investments based on estimated carbon allowances. Moreover, their improper timing can lead to a loss in government social welfare. To mitigate the loss, the dual government incentives of commitment and subsidies are further introduced. Contrary to the intuition that low carbon estimates would lead to an ID decision, firms should choose IA due to the higher costs and shorter lifespan for introducing environmental equipment or lower carbon prices. Generally, the government sets the least strict carbon allowances that still achieve the desired incentives while staying within the permissible spectrum of environmental preservation. However, for firms that face high market demand but experience reduced production due to technological or cost constraints, the government should provide subsidies to encourage them to adopt alternative investment timing. This will ensure product supply, maintain firm profits, and enhance social welfare. ";"2024-01-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623045997";"3";"Emissions"

Previous studies have ignored embodied carbon emissions and employment generation from GVC production activities involving cross-border direct investment, which may underestimate the impact of GVC participation. Using an intercountry input-output model distinguishing domestic and foreign-invested enterprises, this study measured embodied carbon emissions and employment generation in China's GVC production activities from 2005 to 2018 and explored their trade-offs based on the aggregate-embodied carbon employment intensity (ACEI). The major findings were as follows. (1) Trade-related GVC contributes more to embodied carbon emissions than to that of embodied employment. However, investment-related GVC had the opposite effect. Mixed trade and investment-related GVC contribute approximately equally to carbon emissions and employment. (2) China experienced increasing environmental losses relative to employment generation from GVC participation increased between 2005 and 2018. The environmental costs of creating employment units through investment-related GVC activities were lower than those for the other two GVC routes. (3) High R&D-intensive manufacturing industries suffered a notable decline in ACEI. This finding suggests that a double dividend for the environment and employment is more likely to be achieved in high-tech manufacturing industries. (4) The ACEI of foreign-invested enterprises in China was lower than that of domestic enterprises, particularly in the production-sharing activities between foreign-invested enterprises, which exhibited a better trade-off between socioeconomic benefits and environmental damages. These findings provide useful insights into the impact assessment of GVCs, which aid in achieving sustainable development in China and other emerging economies.

As the need for electricity generation is growing increasingly, the integration of these tools can provide a broader perspective for decision-makers and policy-makers. Due to the lack of research in the field of HRA of indirect exposure during the life cycle of an industry, this study was conducted with the aim of applying a comprehensive approach of integrating LCA and HRA.

Results showed that an increase in crosswind speed v c w aggravates the uneven performance distribution among radiators, but variations in ambient temperature t a have little impact. Each growth of 10 °C in t a results in a drop of ∼1.4% in power cycle efficiency η e for both units operating at rated load, corresponding to increases of ∼9 g/(kW·h) and ∼26 g/(kW·h) in coal consumption and CO2 emission rates. η e of the unit with its radiators facing towards ambient crosswind is 0.3% higher than η e of the other unit as v c w exceeds 8 m/s. When both units operate with equal power load rate N p , a decline in N p aggravates the unevenness of air inflow among radiators and amplifies the predominance of air intake of windward radiators for the shared tower. An increase in N p causes a growth in η e for both units, but this growth becomes slight as N p exceeds 75%. For both units operating with different N p , η e declines more sharply with v c w for the unit with a higher N p , especially when radiators of the other unit face towards ambient crosswind.

This study aims to investigate the existence of the environmental employment curve (EEC) in China's main economic sectors. This study examines the relationship between carbon emissions, economic growth, energy consumption, renewable energy consumption and employment (industry, services, agriculture) in China over the period 1990–2020 using threshold autoregressive regression estimation. According to the EEC hypothesis, there exists an inverted U-shaped relationship between environmental pollution and employment rate. Empirical results show that the EEC hypothesis seems to hold in China. Further, an analysis of the impact of employment on environmental pollution in China's three main sectors – industry, service and agriculture – shows that the EEC hypothesis cannot be rejected in the industrial and the agricultural sectors. In addition, empirical results show that a 1% increase in energy consumption leads to a 0.92% increase in carbon emissions, while the use of renewable energy leads to a 0.18% decrease. These results suggest that investments in green energy transformation do not cause employment loss. Hence, it is important to drive policies that promote investments in renewable and clean technologies, stimulate research in renewable energy-related institutions and support public-private partnerships.

Regenerative practices that return residues to the soil offer a ‘no burn’ pathway for addressing air pollution while building soil organic carbon (SOC). Nevertheless, GHG emissions in rice-based agricultural systems are complex and difficult to anticipate, particularly in production contexts with highly variable hydrologic conditions. Here we predict long-term net GHG fluxes for four rice residue management strategies in the context of rice-wheat cropping systems in Eastern India: burning, soil incorporation, livestock fodder, and biochar. Estimations were based on a combination of Tier 1, 2, and 3 modelling approaches, including 100-year DNDC simulations across three representative soil hydrologic categories (i.e., dry, median, and wet). Overall, residue burning resulted in total direct GHG fluxes of 2.5, 6.1, and 8.7 Mg CO2-e in the dry, median, and wet hydrologic categories, respectively. Relative to emissions from burning (positive values indicate an increase) for the same dry to wet hydrologic categories, soil incorporation resulted in a −0.2, 1.8, or 3.1 Mg CO2-e change in emissions whereas use of residues for livestock fodder increased emissions by 2.0, 2.1, or 2.3 Mg CO2-e. Biochar reduced emissions relative to burning by 2.9 Mg CO2-e in all hydrologic categories. This study showed that the production environment has a controlling effect on methane and, therefore, net GHG balance. For example, wetter sites had 2.8–4.0 times greater CH4 emissions, on average, than dry sites when rice residues were returned to the soil. To effectively mitigate burning without undermining climate change mitigation goals, our results suggest that geographically-target approaches should be used in the rice-based systems of Eastern India to incentivize the adoption of regenerative ‘no burn’ residue management practices.";"2024-01-05";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623043986";"9";"Emissions"

Therefore, this study develops an indeterministic fractional two-stage inter-regional energy system (IFTS-IRES) optimization model for planning the energy system in Shanxi Province. The developed model can deal with uncertain parameters expressed as interval values and modify the pre-made policies, which could be an effective method to solve multi-objective optimization problems. Multiple mitigation-policy scenarios are analyzed based on imposing CAEs compensation taxes on electricity consumption regions (ECRs), adjusting renewable energy power targets, and upgrading traditional power plants with carbon capture and storage technology (CCS). The comparison results show that IFTS-IRES is able to detailly reflect the tradeoff between economic development and environmental protection, and the maximal amount of CO2 mitigation will be [1.80, 3.34] K tonne/million RMB. By 2040, wind and biomass would account for [24.55%, 29.02%] and [33.38%, 35.48%] of the power generation capacity, and renewable energy will gradually substitute traditional fossil fuels. Therefore, Shanxi's power system should develop renewable energy rather than upgrade with CCS to realize the goal of carbon peak and carbon neutrality. In addition, the future electricity export will keep increasing, among which the share of wind and biomass power will be [50.86%, 51.69%] and [21.25%, 21.78%]. It is suggested that the mitigation responsibility of inter-regional CAEs should be shouldered by ECRs through paying for compensation taxes. These findings could help decision makers analyze economic and environmental effects with multiple objectives under uncertainties. It provides new insight into regulating the mitigation responsibility existing in inter-regional power transmission grid. The developed model is expected to be applied to other regions heavily dependent on energy resources.

Based on the theoretical analyses, this study estimates the impact of GVCs participation on carbon intensity using the panel data in 22 BRI countries of 40 industries during 2000–2019, it also distinguishes the effects of national-industrial-ownership heterogeneity and clarifies the influence paths. The main findings are: (1) The average carbon intensity level presents a downward trend, and the GVCs position improved gradually recently after a long term decline before 2014 in fluctuation. Both behave differently when distinguishing participants at the country-industry-ownership dimensions. (2) GVCs position has a robust and negative correlation with carbon intensity. (3) At the national scale, developing countries and Annex I countries in the Kyoto Protocol benefit more from GVCs position upgrading in carbon reduction. At the industrial level, increase in GVCs position has significant carbon mitigation effects on agriculture and manufacture (labor and capital intensive) industries, while not significant in service (technology intensive) industries. Considering firm ownership, domestic firms could realize more carbon reduction through GVCs position revolution, while it's not significant for multinational enterprises. (4) From mechanism analyses, the suppression of carbon intensity by GVC upgrading is mainly exerted through its impact on improving capital and labor efficiencies.

In this work, a strategy combined with preheating and dilution was discussed, and NO emission characteristics of air coflowed non-premixed ammonia jet flame were experimentally investigated over 550–700 °C and with N2 dilution, using a novel preheating facility. Results show that the general excess air coefficient is significant for NO emission, but not the unique factor. NO emission monotonically increases with the general excess air coefficient, while the slope decreases. Ambient temperature is also of a remarkable effect, that NO emission decreases by about 100 ppm (15% O2, dry) when the ambient temperature rises from 550 °C to 700 °C. Besides, effects of dilution were considered with three specific strategies. Air coflow dilution is of a negative influence on NO emission, while, NH3 jet dilution promotes NO emission in contrast. The interaction between the two single-dilution strategies is limited, and the effect of double dilution seems to be a simple sum of that of the other two single-dilution strategies. In addition, flame liftoff was observed in experiments and a considerable decline of NO emission was detected with the flame regime transition. According to the experimental results, the combination of elevated ambient temperature and air dilution is evaluated to be a promising low NO emission combustion method of ammonia.

However, there is limited information regarding how different carbon sources regulate the emission of carbon and nitrogen gases from MFC-CWs. This study explored how the type of carbon source regulates the emission of carbon and nitrogen gases in MFC-CWs. Four types of carbon sources (i.e., glucose, sodium acetate, sucrose, and starch) were examined and evaluated for their pollutant removal efficiency and carbon and nitrogen gas emission characteristics in MFC-CWs. The results showed that the specific carbon source significantly influenced the performance of MFC-CWs, where electron transfer regulated denitrification, methane (CH4) production, and respiration. Glucose emerged as the most effective carbon source, enhancing COD (86.77%) and TN (93.85%) removal efficiency, while sucrose was effective for NH4 +-N (93.79%) removal, and starch was beneficial for TP (91.99%) removal. In terms of gaseous emissions, MFC-CWs with glucose as a carbon source significantly (p < 0.05) promoted CH4 emission by regulating the abundance of mcrA and pmoA genes, and significantly (p < 0.05) suppressed CO2, N2O, and NH3 emissions by affecting nir and nosZ genes and electron competition. Overall, glucose was more effective than other carbon sources in promoting denitrification and reducing global warming potential (GWP).

However, by increasing their awareness of the impact of their entire value chains, craft breweries can accelerate the decarbonisation of the industry by creating competition among breweries to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers. This work developed a freely available carbon calculator (10.6084/m9.figshare.22758692) using transparent, open-source data which may be used for benchmarking and identifying opportunities for emission reductions in UK craft breweries as well as providing a reference point for future carbon footprint analyses of global brewing value chains. The carbon footprint for craft brewing was calculated for a wide range of packaging types across three realistic scenarios (low, medium, and high carbon footprints) based on collected data and addresses the discrepancies between values reported in previous literature. Overall, the calculated carbon footprints ranged between 205 (20 L steel kegs, low carbon footprint scenario) and 1483 (single-use, 0.33 L glass bottles, high carbon footprint scenario) gCO2e per litre of beer. Novel hotspots (including wort boiling, the packaging process in a brewery, and the contribution of secondary and tertiary packaging) were identified.

However, how methane-metabolizing microorganisms affect methane emissions from cropland soils of different planting years is not known. In this study, we determined methane emissions from cropland soils of different tobacco-rice rotation years after rice harvesting. By mean of functional gene sequencing, we analyzed the relationship between methane-metabolizing microorganisms and methane emissions, and revealed the microbial mechanism of action for methane emissions from cropland soils. The results showed that the soil organic carbon content was higher (P < 0.05) and methane emissions were lower (P < 0.05) in cropland cultivated for 20–40 years (PY20). Soil methane emissions from PY20 cropland were reduced by 30.11% and 14.58% (P < 0.05) compared to cropland planted for 10–20 years and more than 40 years. The alpha diversity of methanogens communities was significantly lower in PY20 cropland soils, whereas the methanotrophs communities alpha diversity did not differ significantly between planting years. The methanogenic genus Methanocorpusculum was significantly and positively correlated with methane emissions. The relative abundance of Methanocorpusculum in PY20 cropland soil was lower (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of Methylocystis, a type II methanotrophs with greater oxidizing capacity for methane, was higher (P < 0.05). Reducing PY20 cropland soil methane emissions by reducing methane production and enhancing methane oxidation. At the same time, more methanotrophs in PY20 cropland soil formed a molecular interactions network with methanogens. Planting years altered the diversity and composition of methane-metabolizing microbial communities and the interactions of different taxa, which in turn affected methane emissions. Cropland soils that have been cultivated for 20–40 years have lower methane production capacity and higher methane oxidation capacity, resulting in lower methane emissions. This study provides a scientific reference for the microbial action mechanism of soil methane emission from cropland under different planting years, with a view to contributing to carbon neutralization in cropland ecosystems.

Using firm-level data from Chinese A-shape listed companies, this study investigates the relationship between EI on green total factor productivity (GTFP) along the period 2010–2019. To do so, a slack-based measurement model integrated with Global Malmquist-Luenberger approach (SBM-GML) is applied in GTFP calculation, and then a time-varying difference-in-difference (DID) setup is employed for empirical analysis, as well as its combination with propensity score matching method (PSM-DID) to overcome the sample self-selection bias. We find that EI significantly promotes firm's GTFP by about 0.22 units, which is mainly driven by the improvement of technical efficiency rather than technological progress. Further analysis exploring channels suggests that EI promotes GTFP by alleviating financing constraints and stimulating green innovation. However, the heterogeneity analysis shows that both financing constraint mechanism and technological innovation mechanism are mainly observed in heavily polluting and non-state-owned enterprises (non-SOEs).

Traditional urbanization, focusing on the “one-way” concentration of elements in cities and pursuing urban expansion's scale and speed, poses a threat to ALCD. In contrast, new-type urbanization (NTU), which emphasizes a “two-way” concentration of elements in both rural and urban areas, provides an approach to address this issue. Nevertheless, no research has investigated the relationship between NTU, particularly the new-type urbanization pilot policy (NTUPP), and ALCD. To fill this void, this research employs panel data from 210 Chinese cities from 2006 to 2019, using a difference-in-differences (DID) model to investigate the impact and mechanisms of NTUPP on ALCD for the first time. The study reveals: (1) NTUPP significantly boosts the level of ALCD, with cities that have implemented NTUPP showing an average enhancement of 19.13% in ALCD levels compared to those without NTUPP. (2) NTUPP chiefly fosters ALCD by improving agricultural technological efficiency rather than advancing technological progress. (3) Relative to smaller cities, northern cities, eastern cities, resource-based cities, major grain-producing areas, cities with substantial government intervention, and cities with lower levels of financial development, NTUPP is more efficacious in enhancing ALCD in larger cities, southern cities, central and western cities, non-resource-based cities, non-major grain-producing areas, cities with minimal government intervention, and cities with advanced financial development.

Findings reveal that in comparison to general purpose (GP) cement production, sludge treatment has the potential to achieve an impressive 83.48% reduction in carbon emissions. Moreover, a modest 10% substitution of cement with treated sludge would contribute to 9.07% overall carbon reduction.

The construction industry is a major contributor to China's carbon emissions, thus research on energy saving and carbon reduction in this industry is essential.

We used life-cycle thinking (LCT) to analyze the carbon emissions of the whole life cycle of the construction industry and built a model by using a system dynamics method, which analyzes the carbon emission process of the construction industry at different stages. Combined with the planning and policies implemented by the construction-related departments, we identified the main indicators of policy regulation and control.

This study proposed an intermediate-based emission (IBE) accounting approach that considers indirect emissions from intermediate goods production and a case study was conducted using Exiobase 3.8. The highest IBE sector was ‘basic iron’ (1131 Mt-CO2), and the sector’s IBE was higher than its PBE (1052 Mt-CO2).

In addition, IBEs were observed to be closely related to overall supply chain emissions in Germany, Japan, and Asia, and cooperation is required to reduce the emissions. The method enables approaching supply chains with large emissions from three perspectives (production-, consumption-, and intermediate-based accounting) and exploration of the emission reduction responsibilities of the three key sectors.

Based on Chinese panel data from 2008 to 2019, this paper distinguishes itself by investigating the relationship between green financial structures and carbon emission intensity from a structural matching perspective using the two-way fixed effect model, system generalized method of moments model, quantile regression, and the mediating effect model. Our findings indicate that a green financial structure can lower overall carbon emission intensity and that an inverted U-shaped carbon emission mitigation effect results from a green financial structure. Additionally, green financial structures alleviate carbon emission intensity by facilitating the development of energy technology. Furthermore, greater degrees of finance-technology matching effectively lower carbon emission intensity. These findings provide lessons for countries striving to construct comprehensive and reasonable green financial systems to address climate change.

It makes countries adopt policies to reduce vehicular exhaust emissions to achieve sustainable development with improved air quality. The present study identifies factors that influence student's preferences, estimate vehicular emissions and examine policies to minimize use of passive school transport (PST). The responses of 945 students are statistically examined using the Multinominal Logit (MNL) model with factors that affect preferences of school transport. The MNL model revealed that private transports are preferred more by female students. Students covering up to 3 km distance preferred more to use active school transport (AST) than students with travel distance of above 5 km. The model has predicted that students with travel distance of 4 km or above are mostly opted for public travel modes. The representative driving cycle was developed for morning and afternoon school trips and used as an input parameter for the International Vehicle Emission (IVE) model to estimate exhaust emissions. School policies are proposed to reduce PST modes associated student kilometer travelled (SKT) and emissions. The study outcomes revealed that neighborhood school policy predicted significant reduction in yearly SKT for AST (6.07%) and PST (36.03%) modes. While increased walkability policy anticipates modest impact in minimizing the PST mode associated total exhaust emissions (3.18–40.34%). The private vehicle associated SKT and total exhaust emissions are reduced by nearly 27.58% and 34.66% under increased use of public transport policy respectively.

While the potential for mitigating carbon emissions of apparel products deriving from woody versus herbaceous fiber crops remains unclear. Moreover, extant studies only take limited processes as a case demonstration, rather than exploring the impact of additional carbon storage throughout the whole life cycle. Therefore, this study extended the system boundary to the whole life cycle of products from the raw material extraction to the end-of-life disposal stage, conducted a whole life cycle carbon footprint (CF) analysis of cotton/kapok blended T-shirts and pure cotton T-shirts at each stage of their life cycle based on carbon storage accounting method. The results revealed that the CF of 1 kg pure cotton T-shirt is 9.469 kg CO2eq, while for 1 kg cotton/kapok blended T-shirt, it's −24.249 kg CO2eq. Correspondingly, the carbon storages of these T-shirts are −15.653 kg CO2eq and −43.442 kg CO2eq, respectively. This proved that long-term additional carbon storage may possess relatively higher carbon storage due to woody crops' multi-annuality compared with herbaceous crops. When considering carbon emissions during industrial manufacturing and consumer use stages, it's recommended to opt for heavier T-shirts when fabric thickness between pure cotton and cotton/kapok blended T-shirts are comparable, as this choice may align better with environmental considerations, and adopting appropriate washing and caring practices such as choosing lighter-weight garments, utilizing appropriate washing program and detergent dose, opting for air-drying and avoiding ironing when caring for clothing are also advised. The study results affirmed the feasibility of achieving carbon neutrality in apparel products and could provide methodological guidance for future assessment for future research.

Evidence from Chinese enterprises ";" This study investigates the impact of global value chain (GVC) embeddedness on corporate polluting behavior at the micro level. Although existing studies have examined the environmental effects of GVCs, little attention has been paid to the underlying mechanisms through which GVCs affect corporate pollution. To fill this knowledge gap, this study uses Chinese industrial enterprise data over the period 2000–2013 as the research setting to examine the impact of embedded GVCs on corporate polluting behavior. We find that the embeddedness of enterprises in a GVC reduces SO2 emissions. The reduction effect of GVC embeddedness is transmitted through scale and technology effects but not through the composition effect. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that such a reduction effect on corporate pollution is more pronounced in general trading enterprises, domestic enterprises, and enterprises located in regions with high environmental regulations. Further analysis suggests that GVC embeddedness reduces SO2 emissions, mainly through front-end pollution control, by reducing the use of fossil fuels rather than back-end governance. Our findings have important practical implications for GVC participation and sustainable development in emerging economies.

With the proposed method, it is possible to minimize the carbon emissions of the building while optimizing its material utilization and daylighting. The design process consists of three main steps: Firstly, a parametric model of the building was constructed to determine its material utilization, daylighting, and carbon emission under different parameters. The model's accuracy was then experimentally validated. Secondly, establish neural networks between structural parameters (geometry and window-to-wall ratio) and material utilization, daylighting, and carbon emissions. Subsequently, perform a multi-objective optimization of the building's carbon emissions, material utilization and daylighting based on the established neural network. Finally, a modified “Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution” (TOPSIS) is proposed to determine the optimal solution among multiple optimization results. To illustrate the optimization process of the proposed method in detail, it is applied to a real case of greenhouse optimization. To holistically evaluate the optimization, a comprehensive evaluation index, P c , that considers material utilization, daylighting, and carbon emissions, is proposed. The study reveals that upon utilizing the proposed low-carbon optimal design method, the P c of the greenhouse sees a 7.67-fold increase, while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions by 23% compared to original levels. Additionally, specific greenhouse designs were optimized to demonstrate the method's practicality.

It scrutinizes the ramifications of digital economic advancement on carbon emissions, adopting the perspective of the carbon trading market. The investigation delves into novel mechanisms and diverse studies about carbon reduction within the realm of the digital economy. Findings indicate that in carbon trading markets, a one-unit augmentation in the level of digital economic development corresponds to a reduction of 0.417 units in carbon emissions. Regions, whether economically advanced or less developed, witness favorable impetus in carbon reduction effects. However, the latter exhibits a relatively more substantial impact, averaging a reduction of 0.589 units in carbon emissions. Mechanistically, leveraging scale effects and green technological innovation, this research identifies the overarching factor of productivity of enterprises as a pivotal regulatory determinant. The digital economy, while augmenting overall factor productivity, manifests a heightened constraining influence on carbon reduction, particularly evident in companies immersed in carbon trading markets. This study not only introduces a novel analytical perspective for a comprehensive exploration of the carbon emissions impact of the digital economy but also furnishes valuable policy insights to actively propel the evolution of carbon trading markets and carbon finance.

However, the impact of the stage of industrialization on the emission reduction effects of environmental regulation on industrial agglomeration has not been sufficiently studied. This study explores the effect of industrial agglomeration on CO2 emissions using panel data from 286 prefecture-level cities in China from 2003 to 2020 from the perspective of environmental regulation. The results of the extended STIRPAT model showed a U-shaped relationship between industrial agglomeration and CO2 emissions, whereas industrial agglomeration was closely related to the degree of environmental regulation. Tightening environmental regulation hinders the emission reduction effect of industrial agglomeration, especially in the early stages of industrialization. The threshold model indicated that the larger the ratio of industrial output to GDP, the greater the effect of environmental regulation on emission reduction from industrial agglomeration. These findings suggest to reduce emissions in cities, the level of industrial agglomeration and stages of industrialization should be considered to implement effective environmental regulation policies. The timetables to achieve low-carbon development and carbon neutrality can differ and governments should adapt environmental regulation policies to local conditions as much as possible.

However, there is still a lack of reliable PN emission prediction models for RDE test due to the complex nonlinear relationship between various affecting factors and PN emissions. Therefore, this study conducted RDE tests on a light-duty gasoline vehicle to acquire 10,646 sets of data, and four ensemble learning algorithms (randomforest, xgboost, catboost, and lightGBM) were introduced to construct prediction models of instantaneous PN emissions. Based on these models, the importance of 9 features affecting PN emissions was discussed using the Spearman correlation analysis and Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) algorithm. Among them, carbon dioxide share of exhaust (CO2,ratio), acceleration, vehicle specific power (VSP) and engine speed were identified as the critical input features. The catboost model has the optimal performance in prediction accuracy among the four models, with an average R2 and RMSE of 0.832 and 0.00253 respectively for the 10-fold cross-validated. Further analysis of the PN prediction results on different types of roads showed that the catboost model has high accuracy for instantaneous PN emissions on urban, rural and motorway trips. Moreover, the SHAP summary plot was employed to reveal the prediction mechanism of catboost algorithm through quantifying the feature contribution.

Nevertheless, the suitability of the electrification designs heavily depends on the seasonal availability of renewable energy sources. This work proposes to use a multi-period graph-theoretical (P-graph) approach to determine the optimal retrofit strategy to achieve electrification with consideration of economic and environmental factors. Both single-period and multi-period models are considered via a graph-theoretical approach to rank and evaluate all the combinatorically feasible electrification pathways based on the overall performance. The effectiveness of the proposed method is developed using a crude distillation unit (CDU) case study adopted from a multinational company. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using a crude distillation unit (CDU) case study shown in three different scenarios that include prioritizing economic aspect (Scenario 1), prioritizing environmental aspect (Scenario 2), and considering equal importance of both aspects (Scenario 3). For single-period operation, the results showed a mix of natural gas and hydropower energy, exclusive use of onshore wind energy, and a mix of onshore wind energy and biogas cogeneration energy for Scenario 1, Scenario 2, and Scenario 3, respectively. In contrast, the multi-period model also utilized nuclear energy for Scenario 2 and Scenario 3 given the seasonal availability constraint. Following that, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to see the effect of the absence of the most influential energy sources on the optimal solution of each scenario and the top solutions under budget and CO2 emission constraints. Pareto analysis is outlined to offer an understanding of tradeoffs between differently prioritized solutions that decision-makers can select.

The carbon footprint reflects actual carbon emissions and trade connections between sectors, providing a reference for levying carbon taxes on different sectors and examining their impact on the economy. This study utilizes the 2017 non-competitive input-output table of China and CO2 emissions and water consumption data from 27 sectors. Firstly, the research calculates carbon and water footprints of each sector through input-output analysis. Then, utilizing the input-output price model, the article compares the effect of differentiated carbon taxes on CO2 emissions and GDP across sectors in China, examining both direct carbon emissions and carbon footprint. Lastly, the survey constructs a carbon tax optimization model, aiming to maximize carbon and water footprint reduction while minimizing reduction in labor compensation. The key findings are: (1) Different sectors display varying characteristics in terms of direct carbon emissions and carbon footprints. 19 sectors exhibit higher direct carbon emissions than carbon footprints, while 8 sectors show the opposite. (2) Implementing carbon taxes on all sectors in China based on direct carbon emissions and carbon footprints effectively reduces CO2 emissions. However, at the same tax revenue, a reduction of 10^4 yuan in GDP leads to a further decrease of 0.47 × 10^6 tons of CO2 emissions from the carbon footprint perspective compared to direct carbon emissions. (3) In the optimal differentiated carbon tax plan based on carbon footprints, water production sector bears the highest carbon tax at 5.45 yuan/ton, while electricity production sector bears the lowest at 0.1 yuan/ton. This plan declines CO2 emissions by 7.82% and water consumption by 6.21%, but also results in a 0.02% decrease in GDP. The research findings recommend that sectoral differentiated carbon taxes consider economic development and resource impacts. Implementing refund policies to compensate for the economic losses caused by carbon taxes is essential, while also conserving resources and reducing CO2 emissions. These recommendations provide valuable guidance for the future introduction and implementation of differentiated carbon tax policies.

Specifically, extending carbon emissions and carbon offsets both from upstream sources to intermediate users (industries) and from downstream to end users (final use categories).

While numerous studies have explored the relationship between economic variables and emissions, few have examined their cyclical interdependencies, and none as per our knowledge have conducted their study for the QUAD-the United States, India, Japan, and Australia. This gap motivated us to investigate whether discernible cyclical patterns exist in CO2 emissions, trade, GDP, and fossil fuel consumption in these nations. Utilizing the Hodrick-Prescott filter on annual data from 1970 to 2020, sourced from the World Bank and Our World in Data, this study uncovers country-specific procyclical trends in CO2 emissions. To scrutinize the dynamic interactions among these variables, we employ a Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR) approach. Our empirical analysis reveals that a GDP shock elicits different contemporaneous responses in CO2 emissions across the QUAD countries: a positive response in India, Japan, and Australia, but a negative one in the United States. These findings emphasize the need for tailored strategies in managing CO2 emissions, akin to business cycle management, thereby underscoring the policy implications of our research.

To evaluate the carbon emissions and process costs simultaneously in a single indicator, a carbon-techno-economic analysis (CTEA) methodology that combines carbon tax and process cost was developed in this study. The proposed CTEA model was used to optimize the post-combustion carbon capture (PCC) process, which is an energy- and cost-intensive process. In CTEA optimization, as the carbon tax price increases from $12.5/tonne CO2 to $250/tonne CO2, more energy is provided to the PCC process to increase the carbon capture level from 58.92 % to 99.64 %. This results in a decrease in power generation of the natural gas combined cycle power plant from 462.33 MW to 436.07 MW, and an increase in the incremental cost of electricity from $14.05/MWh to $17.74/MWh. The decrease in profit from CTEA optimization is only 8.75 %, which is relatively smaller than the 11.68 % and 32.32 % decrease in profit from energy and TEA optimization, respectively. The results demonstrate that CTEA-based process optimization is beneficial and highlight the trade-off relationship among carbon tax, process cost, and profit.

The policies shifts can reduce CO2 emissions, but methane emissions from switching processes may contribute to short-term climate impacts. The climate impact during the policy transition is still unclear. Thus, this paper developed a lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions framework for coal-to-clean-energy policies in rural northern China. The GHG emissions for heating and cooking, the two most energy intensive activities, were calculated. Four scenarios were designed based on energy types and equipment. Uncertainties in estimating lifecycle GHG emissions under different scenarios were analyzed. The technology warming potential values were calculated for the conversion of scenarios. Besides, the environmental benefits of natural gas versus electricity under emission reduction targets were compared. According to our findings, the total GHG emissions reduction of coal-to-clean-energy shift policies in rural northern China under global warming potential on a 100-year scale (GWP 100) is 1.83 million metric ton CO2 equivalent (MMT CO2 eq) in 2018. Since the climate benefits of policy shifts are driven by chosen technical routes, replacing coal with natural gas should be prioritized; heating with natural gas boilers can maximize GHG emissions reduction and climate benefits. By 2038, the climate benefits of electricity will be far superior to those of natural gas, based on emission reduction targets and electrical mix. There are numerous opportunities to reduce GHG emissions in China's energy sector, and there is a need for the energy industry to obtain better emissions data as well as to increase efforts to reduce GHG emissions.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140010";"Industrial carbon emission forecasting considering external factors based on linear and machine learning models ";" Accurate forecasting of carbon emissions has become a critical task for the government to formulate effective policies and sustainable development. However, previous studies have mainly focused on large-scale carbon emissions forecasting, while urban-level carbon emission forecasting is equally important but rarely covered. In this study, we propose a novel carbon emission forecasting framework combining linear and machine learning models that considers both time dynamics and external influences. To improve the accuracy and explanatory power of the proposed model, we first introduce twelve initial influencing factors by considering the urban development, economic development, industrial energy consumption, and demographic factors. And then Lasso regression algorithm is adopted to filter out the indicators with poor predictive power. Finally, a combined prediction model by integrating Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) models is established to capture linear and nonlinear features, respectively. The simulation results show that compared with benchmark models, the proposed model indicates stronger prediction performance with a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 0.096 and a R-squared (R2) of 97.5%. In addition, six future development scenarios, including carbon emission projections for industrial growth and environmental protection factors, are also performed in this study to provide recommendations for carbon emission reduction programmers and related policy formulation. In conclusion, the forecasting framework proposed in this research can help to identify the key factors affecting carbon dioxide emissions and provide a quantitative reference for carbon dioxide emission reduction.

Additionally, three-dimensional simulations in an oil reservoir model showed improved vertical conformance and oil recovery with aerogel-stabilized foam.

To address this challenge, we construct principal–agent models of a manufacturer and an emission reduction service provider (ERSP), analyze loose two-part tariff and tight equity contracts, and investigate the contract design and decision distortion change of the manufacturer with information disadvantage when the ERSP faces the moral hazard of hiding emission reduction cost information. Results suggest that the manufacturer should adopt a tight equity contract to obtain higher profits in the presence of symmetric information, especially when the proportion of shareholding is high. However, when the shareholding ratio is low, the manufacturer should adopt a loose two-part tariff contract. Low-cost ERSP has more advantages than high-cost ERSP in concluding transactions. Before a deal is reached, the high-cost ERSP is motivated to hide emission reduction cost information to cooperate with the manufacturer. However, after a deal is reached, the low-cost ERSP is motivated to hide emission reduction cost information to gain higher emission reduction benefits. As a result, manufacturers are placed at an information disadvantage, which leads to the decision distortion of the two contracts. In other words, when cooperating with low- or high-cost ERSP and when the proportion of low-cost ERSP is relatively low, the emission reduction price and level are distorted upward. However, when cooperating the high-cost ERSP and when the proportion of low-cost ERSP is relatively high, the emission reduction price and level are distorted downward, and the tight equity contracts emerge as the dominant strategy.

Since carbon emissions vary significantly depending on the hydrogen production method, the impact of carbon capture and storage (CCS) implementation on the overall economic performance of the ammonia synthesis process differs. Therefore, it is crucial to (1) integrate cost-effective CCS into various ammonia synthesis processes and (2) conduct a comprehensive comparison of grey and blue ammonia systems together, considering the economic costs of the carbon emissions. This study aims to investigate the economic feasibility of large-scale ammonia processes under various carbon tax scenarios and suggest carbon-efficient options for the ammonia industry. Three ammonia synthesis processes are designed that differ in their hydrogen production method – steam methane reforming (SMR), autothermal reforming (ATR), and hybrid SMR-ATR – and these three options also have grey ammonia and blue ammonia production versions. The grey ammonia production systems do not include a carbon capture procedure, while the blue ammonia systems ensure that the CO2 emissions are below 0.065 t CO2/t NH3. In the present study, both the grey and blue versions of the three ammonia production processes are subjected to techno-economic evaluation under various carbon tax scenarios. For the grey ammonia systems, economic feasibility varies depending on the carbon tax scenario under consideration. Grey ATR becomes the most cost-effective option within a carbon tax of 95 $/ton to 115 $/ton. In contrast, the economic viability of the blue ammonia systems is unaffected by the carbon tax policy environment. In particular, blue ATR exhibits 6% and 14% lower levelized cost of ammonia (LCOA) compared to the blue SMR and blue Hybrid SMR-ATR, respectively. Overall, the results indicate that, below a carbon tax threshold of 62 $/ton, the SMR process without carbon capture is economically favorable. However, for carbon tax above 62 $/ton, the ATR process with carbon capture has greater economic feasibility than other options. A minimum carbon tax of 62 $/ton is required to promote the transition to blue ammonia. These findings thus provide valuable insight into the establishment of effective carbon regulations in response to the global demand to tackle the climate crisis.

To achieve this, a novel approach utilizing Wavelet analysis is employed to examine the dynamic association among these variables from 1979 to 2020. The analysis utilized continuous wavelet, wavelet coherence, and partial and multiple wavelet coherence techniques, offering a comprehensive understanding beyond the limitations of prior research by investigating the relationships over various time frames. The findings from the wavelet coherence analysis yielded intriguing insights, indicating that an increase in energy transition is likely to result in higher energy intensity and increased CO2 emissions. Surprisingly, the study observed a negative impact of adjusted savings on energy transition in the medium run, whereas in the long term, an increase in adjusted net savings was associated with higher carbon emissions in the Chinese economy. This highlights the intricate interplay between energy transition, adjusted savings, and environmental impacts, with different time scales playing a significant role in shaping these connections. Policymakers should carefully consider these dynamics to formulate effective strategies for sustainable development and carbon emission reduction in China. Furthermore, employing partial and multiple coherence analysis, the outcomes has demonstrated a strong interconnected correlations between energy intensity, green energy transition, CO2 emissions, and adjusted net savings across short-run, medium-run, and long-run time frequencies.

Existing researches difficult to capture the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of pollutant concentrations, resulting in the health impacts of pollutant emissions under different spatiotemporal patterns remain unclear. To fill this gap, this study explores the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of PM2.5 concentrations emitted by HDDTs from a spatiotemporal integration perspective, utilizing a three-dimensional spatiotemporal cube model. On this basis, the disparities in health impacts and economic losses under various spatiotemporal patterns are quantified. The results show that: 1) Differences in spatiotemporal patterns of PM2.5 emissions from HDDTs have obvious public health impacts. 55% of the areas exhibit the Oscillating Hot Spot pattern, with health impacts and economic losses accounting for over 90% of the total. High-High Cluster pattern accounts for 26% of all spatiotemporal cluster patterns, but their health and economic consequences attribute over 80% of the total. 2) Short-term exposure to PM2.5 emissions from HDDTs have resulted in substantial human health impacts and economic losses that cannot be ignored. The results of this study can assist decision-makers in identifying spatiotemporal patterns with high health impacts and economic losses of HDDT emissions, and providing decision support for the formulation of health-oriented environmentally sustainable policies.

Hence, there is an urgent need to establish a real-time carbon emissions characterization model. Xi'an which has a complex land-use structure was chosen as the study site and its carbon emissions were calculated using the Emission Factor Method. The GIS-Kernel Density (KD) model was constructed, and land use was subdivided based on Point of Interest (POI) and road network data. Based on the results of carbon emissions accounting and land-use subdivision, a Multilayer perceptron (MLP) model was established. The remote sensing (RS) images of Xi'an underwent supervised classification, and the carbon emissions of Xi'an were characterized based on the subdivision results and MLP model. The results show that: (1) The accuracy of the characterization model is more than 90%, and with the improvement of RS technology, the accuracy will be further improved; (2) Compared with the existing model, this model can real time reflect the spatial distribution of carbon emissions; (3) Atmospheric emission of Xi'an will be 41.92 million tons at the end of 2022, a decrease of 2.80 million tons compared with that of 2020, but an increase of 0.33 million tons from 2021.

The results indicate that in an ammonia-air mixture atmosphere, diesel undergoes a prolonged ignition process, enhancing the role of premixed combustion. Increasing ammonia substitution at constant speed and load reduces the weight of mixing-controlled combustion, leading to larger areas in the chamber where diesel flames cannot reach. Ammonia oxidation mainly occurs near the diesel flame, as overly lean ammonia-air mixtures fail to sustain stable flame propagation. This results in considerable unburned ammonia emissions, particularly in regions beyond diesel flame reach and engine crevices, adversely affecting combustion efficiency and diminishing the thermal efficiency advantages of such operation. Furthermore, while ammonia combustion contributes to fuel-borne nitrogen oxides (NOx) formation, the overall NOx emissions from ammonia-diesel engines are reduced due to lower combustion temperatures and the deNOx properties of amino groups. However, the partial oxidation of ammonia during the late expansion stroke generates significant levels of nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas, in the emissions, counteracting the intended reduction of carbon dioxide. These experimental findings highlight the necessity of focusing on both improving in-cylinder combustion quality and developing effective aftertreatment systems for NH3 and N2O capture, as crucial steps towards enhancing the environmental performance and market viability of ammonia-diesel dual fuel engines.

We consider an HRES system with a photovoltaic cell, wind turbine, fuel cell, electrolyzer, and diesel generator. The NO 2 and CO 2 emissions from HRES have been conventionally treated using a selective catalytic reactor and monoethanolamine (MEA), respectively. However, a forest ecosystem can naturally uptake NO 2 and CO 2 . Therefore, we have considered the forest ecosystem as an additional unit operation in this study and its growth dynamics have been incorporated in the system design. Thus, we analyze two approaches to remediate emissions from the HRES: (1) technological approach — SCR and MEA, (2) TES approach — forest ecosystem in tandem with technology. Unlike previous TES design studies, we focus on cities in India and compare a traditional method for forest restoration and a faster Miyawaki method considering their growth dynamics. Furthermore, we consider the case of social forestry, which is relevant in developing countries. Here, the trees are pruned, which increases the pollution uptake rate. We find that the emission abatement technology cannot be removed from the system as it is needed for seasons wherein trees shed their leaves; therefore a periodic profile of technology utilization for emissions abatement is observed. We find the TES approach to be more economically feasible for pollution uptake than a purely technology based approach for the sustainable operation of HRES at Delhi and Chennai in India, respectively. Based on this, the annualized cost of electricity generation is found to be 15% less than the base case. Moreover, the study reveals that annualized cost of electricity generation associated with the Miyawaki method is 13% less than the traditional reforestation method for attaining TES designs.

The literature reviewing the relationship between sustainability practices and performance has mainly been concerned with environmental issues and financial outcomes. However, there are few empirical studies that deal with the social dimension of sustainability. This article seeks to address these gaps and contribute to social sustainability studies by suggesting a positive correlation between firms' social sustainability practices – towards employees and community - and social performance, highlighting the role of social and long-term orientation as mediators. Social identity theory and practice-based view are employed to explain these relational mechanisms. Data were collected through a survey of Italian firms in the manufacturing and trade sectors. A two-stage structural equation modeling approach was followed to test the proposed mediation model. The results reveal that when practices are supported by a strong orientation, it triggers the process of social identification, thereby enhancing the firm's social outcomes. From a practice-based view, orientation can explain the performance differences among firms.

However, the current studies have not explored the greenhouse gas emissions from on-farmland consumption of returned straw. Based on a long-term positioning experiment, three treatments were set up in double-cropping rice fields: chemical fertilizer (CF), straw replacing 1/3 nitrogen fertilizer (MS), and straw replacing 2/3 nitrogen fertilizer (HS). We measured the biomass, soil properties, and greenhouse gas emissions of double-cropping rice and then comprehensively evaluated the global warming potential, carbon footprint, and net ecological and economic benefits. The straw treatments (MS and HS) increased the cumulative annual emissions of CH4 (98.44% and 261.23%), CO2 (30.85% and 122.29%), and N2O (7.37% and 52.50%), the cumulative annual global warming potential (74.15% and 206.12%), average GHG intensity (43.26% and 138.07%), and the annual cumulative net ecosystem carbon budget (52.96% and 100.97%) in the early and late rice growing seasons, respectively. We observed that the real-time greenhouse gas emissions were significantly correlated to the soil microbial functional genes and total carbon, NH4 +-N, and NO3 −-N. The results of the random forest model showed that total carbon (13.87%) and nirK abundance (9.80%) were the highest predictors of global warming potential at the booting and maturity stages, respectively during rice growing season. Combining the resource inputs for agricultural production and the greenhouse gas emission potential of the returned straw on its own, MS showed the lowest net greenhouse gas emission, and MS and HS showed significantly increased annual cumulative net ecological economic benefits (38.08% and 34.30%). Overall, MS showed the lowest net greenhouse gas emission and the highest net ecological economic benefits, which is a straw-returning measure with low environmental impact and high economic returns.

This paper probes the impact of intra- and inter-regional digital economy on carbon emissions, considering the mediating effect of structural deviation, utilizing panel data from 267 prefecture-level cities in China spanning the years 2011–2019. The findings reveal the following key insights. First, the connection between the digital economy and carbon emissions within cities follows an inverted “U"" shape. In the early stages, the digital economy leads to an average increase in carbon emissions of 0.069%. However, in the later stages, the digitized economy markedly decrease emissions. Second, both the digital economy and carbon emissions exhibit spatial spillover effects. Within the region, DE has a significant nonlinear spillover effect on CO2 emissions in the neighboring regions, with the spatial decay boundary of this effect extending up to 380 km. Third, analysis of the impact mechanism reveals that the digital economy mitigates local and neighboring carbon dioxide emissions by adjusting structural deviation. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that the digital economy is more likely to have a carbon emission reduction effect in cities that are not involved in the industrial transfer and those that do not belong to the old industrial base.

In an in-depth comparison across the three major global economies—China, the United States, and the European Union —China's leadership is observed to be in a relatively tenuous position. This is particularly evident in structural leadership, where the difference is most pronounced, while the gap in cognitive leadership is comparatively narrower. 2) The study reveals a marked decoupling between power and responsibilities in the climate negotiation interest groups. Countries facing greater pressure to reduce emissions exhibit lower leadership capability, whereas countries with higher historical emissions exhibit greater leadership capability. 3) Utilizing the DEMATEL model, the study identifies critical indicators of carbon neutrality leadership and engages in a quantitative analysis of pathways to strengthen national climate governance leadership.

However, the carbon dioxide (CO2) emission has also increased, which will lead to the greenhouse effect for threatening economic development and affecting people's lives. Global warming has become the greatest challenge to contemporary economic and social development, and the transition to low-carbon economy has become a general trend of world economic development. Meanwhile, the traditional neural network method for predicting the economy and CO2 emissions is not accurate and objective because of the unbalanced labeling of training data and the inability to capture the relationship between time series data. Therefore, an economy and CO2 emission prediction model based on temporal attention Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU) (TA-GRU) with loss function Balanced Mean Square Error (BMSE) (BTA-GRU) mechanism is proposed to analyze and optimize the energy structure of 27 provincial-level administrative regions in China. Due to the unbalanced data labels in the different energy structure of different regions, the improved loss function BMSE is used to solve the problem of unbalanced labels from the perspective of statistics. Then, with coal, gasoline, petroleum, coke, fuel oil, diesel, natural gas and crude oil as inputs, the per capita Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as the desired output and the CO2 as the undesired output, the GRU can better capture time step dependencies in time series, and the attention mechanism can assign different weights to each time step, so that the proposed method can better learn data features and improve the accuracy of the an economic and CO2 emission prediction model. Finally, the CO2 emission and economic prediction model of different provincial-level administrative regions in China is established based on this proposed method. The experimental results show that compared with other mainstream time series data prediction models, this proposed model has better stability and practicability, and its mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and root mean square error (RMSE) reach 3.43, 3.28% and 2449.57, respectively.

The results indicate that in an ammonia-air mixture atmosphere, diesel undergoes a prolonged ignition process, enhancing the role of premixed combustion. Increasing ammonia substitution at constant speed and load reduces the weight of mixing-controlled combustion, leading to larger areas in the chamber where diesel flames cannot reach. Ammonia oxidation mainly occurs near the diesel flame, as overly lean ammonia-air mixtures fail to sustain stable flame propagation. This results in considerable unburned ammonia emissions, particularly in regions beyond diesel flame reach and engine crevices, adversely affecting combustion efficiency and diminishing the thermal efficiency advantages of such operation. Furthermore, while ammonia combustion contributes to fuel-borne nitrogen oxides (NOx) formation, the overall NOx emissions from ammonia-diesel engines are reduced due to lower combustion temperatures and the deNOx properties of amino groups. However, the partial oxidation of ammonia during the late expansion stroke generates significant levels of nitrous oxide (N2O), a greenhouse gas, in the emissions, counteracting the intended reduction of carbon dioxide. These experimental findings highlight the necessity of focusing on both improving in-cylinder combustion quality and developing effective aftertreatment systems for NH3 and N2O capture, as crucial steps towards enhancing the environmental performance and market viability of ammonia-diesel dual fuel engines.

This study addresses the significant and understudied question of how EHVs’ adoption influences CO 2 emissions using panel U.S. state-level data over the 2016-2019 period and fixed effects. The study finds no statistically significant relationship between the adoption of hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and CO 2 emissions. These findings could be explained by adoption rates of HEVs and PHEVs that are too low to manifest statistically significant reductions in CO 2 emissions from the potential displacement of internal-combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). The findings also align with observations indicating that PEVs, although emission-free, are frequently adopted as supplementary rather than primary vehicles by multi-vehicle households in the U.S. The complexities surrounding EHVs and their impact on CO 2 emissions highlight the importance of further research in understanding the role these vehicles play in the larger context of sustainable transportation as well as more nuanced research into adoption patterns, potential policy interventions, and broader environmental implications.

The hypothesis of this research is that soil CO2 emission in situ (FCO2) is variable between LULCs across different biomes and that there may be an association between soil CO2 flux and environmental variables such as temperature and soil moisture. This study evaluated FCO2, measured by a portable EGM-5 CO2 gas analyzer, CO2Flux model (obtained by remote sensing approach), soil moisture (SM), soil temperature (ST) and relationship between these variables in different LULC classes. We identified LULCs can contribute to carbon neutralization actions over the Cerrado, Atlantic Forest and Pantanal biomes located in State of Mato Grosso do Sul (MS), Brazil. Four LULC classes were evaluated in each biome: agriculture (soybean cultivation), pasture, eucalyptus plantation, and native vegetation. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to verify the relationship between biomes and LULC classes with the variables evaluated, and a Pearson correlation plot was created to assess the relationship between the variables evaluated. The lowest FCO2 values were found in eucalyptus and soybean crops, regardless of biome. Our findings reveal the existence of soil CO2 flux variability between the different LULCs and biomes. Pasture in Pantanal and Atlantic Forest biomes exhibited the highest FCO2 values. Eucalyptus cultivation and native forest showed negative CO2Flux values, regardless of biome. Lower FCO2 values were also observed for soybean cultivation. Such findings reinforce that native vegetation function as carbon sinks and that, therefore, their conservation is vital for the mitigation of CO2 emissions. However, soybean and eucalyptus farming can be strategic for low carbon agriculture in MS and carbon neutralization projects by simultaneously contribute to economic and sustainable development of the regions covered by the biomes evaluated here.

In 2018, to reduce emissions, the European Union (EU) implemented a monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) system for large ships using EU ports. The MRV system has been functional for five years, with four years of data available as of May 2023. Despite this, the MRV data have not been fully explored, particularly in terms of analyzing the temporal trends of key parameters in MRV reports and evaluating the emission performance of shipping companies during the MRV implementation period. To address these gaps, this study analyzes MRV data collected from 2018 to 2021, investigating trends in ship's basic information, emissions monitoring methods, and energy efficiency. A case study of five shipping companies is conducted to evaluate their carbon emission performance, which highlights the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on the industry. Furthermore, this study proposes policy recommendations and management strategies based on the data analysis results; these include facilitating collaboration and knowledge sharing, investing in green shipping infrastructure, and adopting accurate monitoring methods.

In this regard, an industrial broiler house containing 20,000 chickens equipped with four cooling pads operated by a mechanical ventilation system located in Biskra, Algeria, was simulated with six scenarios, including the original. The model developed is verified with the field test measurements and experimental and numerical data in the literature. The results showed that optimizing the cooling pad position increases average indoor air temperature and velocity distribution by 0.1% and 8%, respectively. Moreover, the position and configuration of installing the EAHE inlets play an important role in uniforming indoor air distribution. Scenario 3, with 80 EAHE inlets versus exhaust fans, has the best indoor air uniformity, with a maximum velocity and temperature difference between its sections of 1.15 m s−1 and 1.4 K, respectively. Overall, EAHE showed a good ability to cool and maintain appropriate indoor air temperatures, achieving a difference of 15 °C between inside and outside, in addition to providing annual energy savings of 921,600 kWh/year and reducing 30,643 tons of CO2 emissions during its lifespan, in contrast, its simple payback time estimated 4 years.

Although recent studies have highlighted how Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and green institutional quality could individually mitigate environmental degradation, the literature on their interactive effect has been marginalized. This study investigates the combined impact of ICT and green institutional quality on ecological footprint using nations of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO). Additionally, the study introduces the Heteroscedasticity and Autocorrelation Consistent (HAC) model to forecast footprint and propose mitigation pathways that account for volatilities. The analysis in this study has been made using both the Driscoll Kraay Standard Estimator Model and the HAC model. The results indicate that the combined effects of green institutional governance and ICT yield a 0.0748% reduction in footprint. Again, the forecasted results show that if current trends persist, SCO nations will collectively increase their footprint from 1.639 in 2018 to 4.829 (number of earth) in 2040. However, if these countries follow the proposed pathways, they will collectively reduce their footprint to 0.3079 (number of earths) by 2040.

This paper utilizes data from Chinese A-share listed companies between 2010 and 2020 as its research sample. Using SynTao Green Finance ESG ratings as an exogenous shock, it constructs a staggered difference-in-differences model to empirically examine the impact and mechanisms of ESG ratings on corporate carbon emissions. The research findings indicate that ESG ratings have a significant inhibitory effect on corporate carbon emissions. This conclusion remains valid after undergoing parallel trend tests, placebo tests, instrumental variable regressions, and other robustness checks. Mechanism tests indicate that ESG ratings promote reducing corporate carbon emissions by alleviating corporate financing constraints and addressing agency problems. Analyst attention and media attention reinforce the inhibitory effect of ESG ratings on corporate carbon emissions. The inhibitory effect of ESG ratings on corporate carbon emissions is further pronounced in heavily polluting enterprises, with relatively consistent impacts observed between state-owned and non-state-owned enterprises.

Third, the implementation of the Broadband China Policy facilitates carbon emissions reduction through the promotion of green technology progress, optimization of industrial structures, green transformation of residents' lifestyles, and electrification of energy mix. Finally, the Broadband China Policy has a positive spatial spillover effect on the carbon intensity in the surrounding regions of pilot cities, but it has no significant effect on the total carbon emissions and per capita carbon emissions in the surrounding regions.

With this approach, concrete can be turned into a functional carbon sink (C-sink). Until now, biochar has been mainly used without modification to replace part of the cement or of the aggregates in concrete. However, this technology comes with a number of practical problems, which include the high water absorption of the biochar (due to its high specific surface) and hazards (dust, risk of combustion). In this paper we present an alternative approach, in which biochar is first processed into lightweight aggregates in a cold-bonding process. To this end, biochar is pelletized together with water and a small amount of hydraulic binder forming round pellets that further harden with hydration. In this way, carbon-rich lightweight aggregates (C-LWA) are obtained that are easier to handle than the original biochar. The C-LWA pellets have similar porosity and strength as conventional LWA and can be used for similar applications. Yet, the CO2 emissions from sintering traditional LWA are avoided and the C-LWA are instead an effective C-sink. We demonstrate that it is possible to incorporate in the pellets and eventually in the concrete a sufficient amount of carbon to compensate for the original emissions of concrete. The net-zero emissions concrete obtained with this approach possesses mechanical performance sufficient for typical structural applications in buildings.";"2024-01-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623041665";"13";"Emissions"

First, we construct a kinetic model of lychee by using the Arrhenius equation. And then, we propose a carbon emission measurement with the unit effective carbon emission and the comprehensive carbon emission utility by using life cycle assessment. With this measurement, we measure the rate of loss and life cycle carbon emissions of four lychee's circulation scenarios, including: cold chain, room temperature, cold chain broken at the beginning and cold chain broken at the end. The results show that with the traditional carbon emission measurement, the carbon emissions generated by the cold chain circulation scenario are the highest in total carbon emissions under the four scenarios.

To address these challenges, this paper presents a distributionally robust optimization (DRO) method for multi-objective scheduling in integrated electricity and natural gas distribution networks (IENGDNs).

To achieve enhanced denitrification (deNOx) performance, H2-SCR catalysts with mixed zeolite and TiO2 supports washcoated on monolithic cordierite were developed. The catalyst support, active metal type and content, and monolithic cordierite cell density significantly influenced the H2-SCR performance. The xPt/TiO2 catalysts (where x is the metal content, wt.%) achieved >90% NOx conversion 135–180 °C, whereas the xPd/TiO2 catalysts exhibited poor H2-SCR activity, with <30% NOx conversion. In contrast to 0.5Pt/TiO2, the 0.5Pt/zeolite catalysts achieved high NOx conversion at 140–150 °C (91% at 140 °C for 0.5Pt/ZSM-5 > 89% at 140 °C for 0.5Pt/BETA >85% at 150 °C for 0.5Pt/SSZ-13), suggesting that zeolite supports significantly promote H2-SCR activity at low reaction temperatures. For the 0.5Pt/ZSM-5 washcoated monolithic catalyst, increasing the cell density from 400 to 900 cpsi significantly improved the NOx conversion from 52% to 90% at 100 °C owing to the increased geometric surface area and open frontal area of monolithic cordierite. For catalyst with mixed supports (0.5Pt/yZSM-5zTiO2) changing the ZSM-5/TiO2 ratio (y:z) from 25:75 to 90:10 increased the low-temperature NOx conversion from 39% to 89% at 100 °C, indicating that the deNOx characteristics can be tuned. With NO as the reactant, the 0.5Pt/90Z10T catalyst produced the lowest N2O share (8–17%) within the temperature window of maximum NOx conversion, resulting in an increased N2 share (83–88%).

However, with only a few recent well-executed studies on carbon emission reduction in the sludge treatment field, the literature awaits a more comprehensive assessment and prediction whether the sludge treatment industry can achieve the dual-carbon target. This article aims to fill this gap, holistically examining the carbon emission reduction potential in the industry. Using the moving average method and IPCC method, the projected carbon emission value of sludge treatment in China from 2021 to 2030 indicates a total net carbon emission of 0.3 million tons by 2030. This suggests that the sludge treatment industry is on track to meet the carbon peak target, leaving surplus carbon quotas or credits available to assist other industries for carbon emissions reductions. The study also finds that only incineration and composting demonstrate the potential to be able to partially offset carbon emissions through resource utilization in certain stages or processes. Therefore, the current sludge treatment methods do not yield comprehensive emission reduction effects and cannot provide sufficient contribution to China's dual carbon goals. To address this issue, the paper explores a new scheme that focuses on improving the sludge treatment process. The scheme comparative analysis reveals that, even with all sludge treatment methods optimized, the total net carbon emissions of the industry could only be reduced to 0.058 million tons. This reduction falls short of significantly mitigating carbon emissions to achieve the carbon neutrality goal. Therefore, industries unable to achieve substantial net carbon reduction may need to explore alternative measures, such as carbon sinks, to ultimately attain carbon neutrality.

Synchronizing seems desirable so that electricity from renewables will not be curtailed and overall greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can be reduced. However, the change in GHG emissions by utilizing load shifting in electric power systems depends on the prevailing electricity generation mix. Although some publications discuss the impact of load shifting on the GHG emissions of specific electric power systems, a systematic analysis on the GHG emissions due to load shifting in general is still missing. We fill this gap by determining the changes in GHG emissions that result from cost-optimal load shifting in electric power systems. For our analysis, we consider the impact of load shifting in electric power systems with different shares of low-, medium-, and high-emission technologies. The results show that GHG emissions can both increase and decrease by utilizing load shifting, depending on the electricity generation mix in electric power systems. Hence, we emphasize that load shifting is not per se environmentally beneficial. Furthermore, we analyze the electric power systems of three regions of the world and conclude that utilizing load shifting is not reducing GHG emissions in every region today. However, the targeted electricity generation mix for the regions in 2050 suggests that the utilization of load shifting will reduce GHG emissions in the future. Furthermore, we show that under a sufficiently high CO2-price, load shifting is always environmentally beneficial in today's electric power systems.

This study measures the index of “World Trade Organization+"" and “World Trade Organization-X,” finds the complex impact of the two types of deep integration of trade agreements on embodied carbon emissions from the network perspective, and compares them to draw conclusions and suggestions. First, the global trade-embodied carbon transfer link spontaneously diversifies, with most countries moving from the network's perimeter to its center. Second, more trade agreements can help carbon-absorbing, and carbon-spillover countries narrow the “production side” and “consumption side” divide. Third, “World Trade Organization+"" and “World Trade Organization-X"" deep integration influence embodied carbon emission linkages differently for countries with different embodied carbon emission attributes, with “World Trade Organization-X"" having a more significant impact. At the policy level, free trade agreements have deepened to a certain extent to provide a consistent and synergistic path for trade governance and climate globalization. Countries should actively introduce relevant provisions based on the governance of trade-embodied carbon emission reductions in “World Trade Organization+"" and “World Trade Organization-X"", especially in “World Trade Organization-X"", and some of the relevant policy provisions can be appropriately weighted in favor of developing countries.

Decarbonization of road logistics relies on the widespread diffusion of existing and emerging technological transport solutions. These include alternative fuel vehicles, battery technologies, renewable energy and charging solutions. All promise to reduce carbon emissions, but their implementation remains challenging, expensive, and risky. As early adopters of alternative fuel vehicles have reported, transitioning from fossil fuels poses challenges that must be prepared for and understood to minimize the obstacles to genuine emissions reductions in road logistics. A considerable volume of academic research has been published advocating emission reduction solutions and providing detailed analyses of their potential positive environmental impacts. However, to our knowledge, no frameworks integrate these analyses with practical insights into current and anticipated challenges for road logistics operators transitioning from fossil fuels to a decarbonized future. This paper analyses contemporary evidence and insights on current and future issues and presents an integrated framework for road freight logistics decarbonization challenges. The framework primarily focuses on decarbonization through alternative fuels and analyses three categories of challenges from socio-technical, economic, and environmental perspectives. The three categories of challenges relate to alternative fuel vehicles and fleets, alternative fuel distribution infrastructure and renewable energy generation. The underlying principle of the framework is to provide a practical tool that supports a more informed view of both the advantages and challenges of transitioning to alternative fuels. This research contributes to the body of knowledge by providing a framework to help direct future research into tackling these logistics decarbonization challenges. The insights presented in this paper may also inform practitioners by sensitizing them to potential roadblocks in the transition away from fossil fuels.

To achieve enhanced denitrification (deNOx) performance, H2-SCR catalysts with mixed zeolite and TiO2 supports washcoated on monolithic cordierite were developed. The catalyst support, active metal type and content, and monolithic cordierite cell density significantly influenced the H2-SCR performance. The xPt/TiO2 catalysts (where x is the metal content, wt.%) achieved >90% NOx conversion 135–180 °C, whereas the xPd/TiO2 catalysts exhibited poor H2-SCR activity, with <30% NOx conversion. In contrast to 0.5Pt/TiO2, the 0.5Pt/zeolite catalysts achieved high NOx conversion at 140–150 °C (91% at 140 °C for 0.5Pt/ZSM-5 > 89% at 140 °C for 0.5Pt/BETA >85% at 150 °C for 0.5Pt/SSZ-13), suggesting that zeolite supports significantly promote H2-SCR activity at low reaction temperatures. For the 0.5Pt/ZSM-5 washcoated monolithic catalyst, increasing the cell density from 400 to 900 cpsi significantly improved the NOx conversion from 52% to 90% at 100 °C owing to the increased geometric surface area and open frontal area of monolithic cordierite. For catalyst with mixed supports (0.5Pt/yZSM-5zTiO2) changing the ZSM-5/TiO2 ratio (y:z) from 25:75 to 90:10 increased the low-temperature NOx conversion from 39% to 89% at 100 °C, indicating that the deNOx characteristics can be tuned. With NO as the reactant, the 0.5Pt/90Z10T catalyst produced the lowest N2O share (8–17%) within the temperature window of maximum NOx conversion, resulting in an increased N2 share (83–88%). Thus, the synergetic effect of mixed ZSM-5/TiO2 catalyst supports can enhance low-temperature NOx conversion and mitigate N2O formation.

Particular attention is paid to the role of different types of energy, including renewable, hydro and nuclear energy, as well as oil, gas and coal, in shaping GHG emissions. Unlike previous studies, the paper analyzes the full range of energy resources and focuses on different quantiles of data using the quantile-quantile regression (QQR) method. The results of this approach are compared with traditional quantile regression (QR) to assess its validity. Among the findings of this study are: (1) different parts of the energy mix have a heterogeneous impact on GHG emissions in different quantiles; (2) energy consumption patterns play a more significant role in shaping GHG emissions than production patterns; (3) increasing production and consumption of fossil fuels does not necessarily increase GHG emissions; (4) similarly, the development of renewable energy sources is not always accompanied by a reduction in GHG emissions. Our general conclusion is that existing climate policy requires significant diversification to not be focused only on renewable energy, which impact on GHG emissions is not as homogeneous as it usually considered, and which cannot solve the problem of raising emissions solely.

Researchers have explored how green space characteristics, such as size, theme, and convenience, influence urban movement. However, an important aspect that has received limited attention is the relative attractiveness of green spaces. When residents have access to similar green spaces nearby, their inclination to visit more distant ones decreases. This leads to the central research question: How does the relative attractiveness of urban green spaces affect urban movements? The existing literature lacks a comprehensive theory to address this question. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the Potential to Kinetic Energy (PKE) framework, inspired by principles from physics. In this framework, potential energy represents the relative attractiveness of green spaces between the travel origin and destination, while kinetic energy signifies the urban movement resulting from the this attractiveness. To demonstrate the PKE framework's applicability, this paper analyzes green space data and smart card subway ridership records from Beijing. The results show that a unit increase in size, cultural, attraction, proximity, and location potential energy is associated with a 0.22%, 0.27%, 0.14%, 0.19%, and 0.02% increase in urban movement. The findings provide compelling evidence for the significant role of relative attractiveness in shaping urban movements and offer valuable insights for urban planning and policy development.

Representative conditions from the world Harmonized Transient Cycle were selected to comprehensively assess engine emissions and catalyst performance. Experiments under constant and variable λ conditions tested the catalyst's response concerning raw emissions, exhaust temperature, and space velocity, all variables affected by engine operation.

The biomass materials covering increased electrical conductivity and reduced the diversity and network complexity of bacterial communities in compost. Finally, the lignocellulosic structure and functional groups of the biomass materials were destroyed, thus biomass material could not be reused.

In addition to physical interception, the nitrogen-reducing bacterial communities enriched on the membrane surface (Georgenia and Limnobacter) further reduced NH3 and N2O emissions. The bacterial communities in membrane-covered treatment exhibited concentrated connections and potential cooperation. As a result, the membrane covering achieved higher maturity and better reduction performance of gaseous emissions. Characterization of covering materials revealed that the membrane structure was intact and could be reused. Interestingly, after composting, the membrane surface formed a “microbe-rich biofilm”, which exhibited better performance in subsequent covering processes.

Nevertheless, the manufacturing and end-of-life stages of solar power systems leave an environmental footprint and produce pollutants. Hence, a global perspective on photovoltaic (PV) systems using life cycle assessment methodology is necessary. Here, we investigated the life cycle impacts of P- and N-type PV modules in terms of their energy consumption, carbon emissions, and human toxicity potential. In addition, the energy payback durations of P- and N-type PV modules were computed. In this study, we used the Life Cycle Assessment Basic Database from the National Engineering Laboratory of Industrial Big Data Application Technology at Beijing University of Technology to create a life cycle assessment model for N-type PV modules. Subsequently, we performed a life cycle assessment of Chinese silicon N-type- and P-type PV modules. The research system encompassed the production processes for metallic silicon materials, solar-grade silicon materials, silicon wafers, cells and modules, utilization, recycling, and other interrelated processes. We found that the production and processing of silicon-to-solar-grade polysilicon feedstock were crucial stages that significantly affected the energy consumption and environment of P- and N-type PV modules in China. The high electricity consumption of this process, combined with the dominance of coal power in China's electricity structure, contributed to the substantial energy consumption and environmental impacts of the PV modules. Therefore, this stage is critical for the low-carbon and environmentally sustainable manufacturing of N-type PV modules in China. Carbon emissions for both the P-type and N-type PV modules were lower only during the cell production phase but higher during the other stages when compared to the P-type and N-type PV modules. The n-type bifacial PV modules yielded the highest return on investment in terms of energy. Different regions and installation types have a substantial impact on the carbon emissions of P-type and N-type PV modules. Projections indicate that the potential to lower carbon emissions from n-type PV modules will increase by 2060.

However, there is limited research on systems that integrate these three technologies. A notable mismatch arises between the waste heat generated and the requirements for building heating, but it is often overlooked. Moreover, a discernible lack of comprehensive analysis concerning the multifaceted influences associated with using renewable energy exists. Therefore, this paper employs a range of metrics to comprehensively assess a renewable energy integration system considering the mismatch of the waste heat recovery in data centers. The results indicate that due to mismatch characteristics, the energy-saving rate of heating systems will not constantly climb with the increase in energy savings. It causes only 45.5% of waste heat available for heating purposes achieving a power usage effectiveness of 1.17 and the rest will be abandoned. Similarly, its economic performance doesn't absolutely improve with the expansion in heating volume, the payback period doesn't continue to fall but increases after reaching the optimal level of 5.7. The proposed system accomplishes a 45.8% reduction in energy consumption for the cooling system, a notable decrease of 90% in carbon emissions, and a 55.7% reduction in annual cash flow.

Based on a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) with dual recycling channels and considering recycling advertising invested both in offline and online recycling channels, this paper attempts to explore the optimal recycling advertising mode which can both achieve economic and environmental performance under cap-and-trade regulation. Therefore, game models including a manufacturer and above either recycler are established, which are respectively correspond to four recycling advertising modes: manufacturer cooperates with neither recycler (MO mode), manufacturer only cooperates with the offline retailer (MR mode), manufacturer only cooperates with the online recycling platform (MT mode), and manufacturer cooperates with either recycler (MRT mode). Consequently, this paper solves the optimal decisions of the tripartite and focuses on the analysis of the impact of cooperative (competitive) recycling advertising under cap-and-trade regulation. By comparing the profits and total carbon emissions of the whole CLSC under four recycling advertising modes, the results indicate that: cooperative advertising between the manufacturer and two recyclers can achieve economic and environmental performance for the whole CLSC if the free-riding phenomenon occurs in recycling advertising. Otherwise, influenced by competitive recycling advertising, the above mode turns to the suboptimal one for the profits of two recyclers and the total carbon emissions of the CLSC. Moreover, driven by economic benefits, cooperative advertising will eventually become a consensus, but the total carbon emissions may not always be the least.

Due to the current research deficiencies and ORC system characteristics in ammonia synthesis manufacturing plant, the developed therm-economic optimization is established, considering the consumption of circulating water subsystem. According to the equilibrium of pay and gain exergy, the coefficient of exergy performance (COEP) of total system is proposed. The behaviors and detailed discussions of the electricity production cost (EPC), which consists of direct energy cost, primary non-energy cost, circulating water subsystem cost, and organic fluid cost, are examined. The exergy and economic comparison is conducted, and optimization is implemented for maximum COEP and minimum EPC. Furthermore, according to evaluation results, there are contradictions between equipment optimization and system optimization in certain operating conditions. Better system performance is achieved in specific evaporation temperature, lower condensation temperature and larger circulating water temperature rise. Under the optimal operation condition, the exergy efficiency of condenser and system is improved by 35.53% and 5.00%, the COEP increases by 1.65, and the EPC is reduced by 0.043 Yuan/kWh, respectively.

Recently, such alternatives as enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) have garnered interest due to the increased risk of chemical shortage. In this study, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to compare EBPR and CP in three scenarios: 1) baseline – precipitation chemicals available, 2) stricter effluent requirements – precipitation chemicals available, and 3) chemical shortage – no precipitation chemicals available. Data acquisition that was based on dynamic process simulation was useful, yielding more site-specific results, in contrast to standard literature values. The results indicated substantial differences in greenhouse gas emissions between configurations (around three times higher methane emissions for EBPR compared to CP configurations – although this finding requires further validation). These differences suggest that different emission factors for EBPR and CP should be considered. Furthermore, it is suggested to include waterline methane emissions, at least when the configuration incorporates anaerobic reactors in the water line. Further validation of emissions is necessary, especially for EBPR plants with side-stream hydrolysis and digester reject water treatment. The LCA results showed a similar overall environmental impact for both configurations, but the results of individual impact categories differed. EBPR caused greater climate impact due to the larger direct emissions of methane. Toxicity was more important for CP, based on the inherent heavy metal content in precipitation chemicals. Freshwater eutrophication was similar for both configurations, assuming that precipitation chemicals were available. However, if the recipient is sensitive, implementing EBPR reduces the freshwater eutrophication potential by 75% during a chemical shortage, and should be considered.";"2024-11-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624034966";"2";"Emissions"

However, previous studies have focused more on paddy fields, little is known as to how water table management in subsurface drained fields or how irrigation practices in humid areas might affect the global warming potential (GWP). Drawing upon experimental data from four intensive crop production sites in Eastern Canada operating under different water management practices, the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) biogeochemical model was used to assess potential GHG emissions under twelve different sets of General Circulation Models coupled with Regional Climate Models (GCM-RCM) climate projections (2046–2075). Simulations showed that water table control/sub-irrigation and sprinkler irrigation might decrease GWP by allowing greater soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, despite increased N2O and CO2 emissions than non-irrigated systems. While drip irrigation marginally increased the SOC sequestration, GWP still increased because the C gains from the residues generated by the greater crop biomass were offset by increased CO2 and N2O emissions. Compared with surface drip irrigation, subsurface drip irrigation reduced the GWP by reducing N2O emissions, as well as increasing crop yield and SOC stock. Although greater crop biomass was expected to return to soil under projected climate change, simulations showed a consistent increase in the GWP of tomato cropping system alone under climate change.";"2024-09-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624026799";"1";"Emissions"

This work reports for the first time a systematic techno-economic assessment of the conventional (ammonia-based) and modified (calcium hydroxide-based and Potassium hydroxide-based) Solvay processes. The model evaluates the effect of reactor conversion, inlet CO2 weight%, inlet CO2 temperature, gas/liquid ratio, and brine flow rate on the CO2 and Sodium ions removal.

Here we strive to explore an efficient separation method to recycle the wastewater. The triple-column extractive distillation with concentration column (TED), pressure-swing azeotropic distillation process combining of the concentration column (PSAD) and the reactive coupling pressure-swing azeotropic distillation (RCPSAD) encompasses ethylene oxide (EO) hydration reaction is presented. A simultaneous optimization strategy is proposed to optimize the parameters through the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) taking the economic and environment indexes as the objectives, and the exergy analysis is adopted to evaluate the thermodynamic efficiency. Results show that the pressure-swing azeotropic distillation process (PSAD) is superior in terms of total annual cost of 2.46 × 106$/y and CO2 emissions of 0.90 × 107 kg/y when compared to the other two processes and the reactive coupling pressure-swing azeotropic distillation (RCPSAD) with the exergy efficiency of 54.72 %, making it the most energy-saving process.

Public potable water distribution systems, which account for approximately 1.2% of statewide electricity demand, may be able to shift the timing of their operations by filling their storage tanks when renewable energy is prevalent to help the California energy grid reduce renewables curtailment, grid emissions, and peak energy demand. We simulate the water demand, pumping, and energy demands of 702 public water distribution systems serving 84% of Californian residents under eight different energy pricing and emissions minimization scenarios. We find that the potable water distribution sector in California has the flexibility to shift its energy demands by up to 1071 GWh annually, reduce renewable energy curtailment by up to 68%, reduce the net demand peak by up to 321 MW, and avoid 330,627mTCO2e of emissions. The scenarios that led to the greatest load shifting and emissions reductions included time-of-use energy rates that incentivize consumption during the middle of the day without a demand charge. The findings of this work not only highlight the potential of the water sector to help meet future energy and emissions goals, but also how the energy sector can best incentivize this shift.";"2024-01-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623045316";"6";"Emissions"

This study aimed to investigate the performance of a pyrite/biochar-based BRS coupled with microbial fuel cell (MFC) (PBM-BRS) in terms of pollution removal, bioelectricity generation, and GHG emissions under various operating conditions. Compared with the conventional bioretention system (C-BRS), the PBM-BRS demonstrated an enhanced capacity for pollutant removal, with an increase of 5%–30%. It also exhibited low GHG emissions, as evidenced by a CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) release flux of 971.20 ± 277.54 mg CO2/(m2·d). As the influent C/N ratio increases, all systems experienced an increase in NO3 −-N and TN removal, output voltage, and power density. Meanwhile, the accumulation of nitrite nitrogen (NO2 −-N) gradually diminished, and the emission fluxes of CO2eq decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Microbial analysis revealed that the PBM-BRS significantly affected the community structure, promoting the proliferation of electroactive bacteria (e.g., Geobacteraceae), and augmenting the abundance of denitrification functional enzymes (narG, nirS, norB, and nosZ) through the incorporation of pyrite. The SEM and spectroscopy (XPS and FTIR) results indicated that the electrochemical action facilitated Fe2+/Fe3+ in-situ supported on biochar (Fe@BC), promoting electron transport. This process impeded the respiration of methanogenic bacteria and diminishing the formation of intermediate product N2O. In conclusion, the PBM-BRS demonstrated superior performance in the removal of NO3 −-N, reduction of GHG emissions, and bioelectricity generation through a synergistic action of adsorption, electrolysis, and microbial degradation. This confirms the high potential of PBM-BRS as a highly promising technology for water treatment. ";"2024-01-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262304578X";"5";"Emissions"

Despite emphasizing energy efficiency and environmental protection since the 1990s, China still grapples with resource wastage and environmental pollution in its development. Consequently, controlling negative environmental impacts is an important issue in achieving balanced development in China, as well as in other economies around the world. This study collected crucial Water-Energy-Food Nexus (WEF Nexus) variables from 31 Chinese provinces and regions between 2016 and 2020. It utilized the Dynamic Slack-Based Measure (DSBM) model to assess the overall WEF Nexus efficiency across these provinces and regions. Empirical results show: a) After incorporating pollutant emissions, the WEF Nexus total efficiency declined from 0.5703 to 0.5124, indicating the impact of pollutant emissions on overall efficiency. This suggests a potential need for enhanced efforts across Chinese provinces to reduce emissions. b) Among the studied provinces and regions, ten, including Beijing, Guangdong, Hainan, and Jiangsu, exhibited a WEF Nexus total efficiency value of 1, while Hebei, Guangxi Zhuang, and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Regions showcased the poorest overall efficiency. c) China's population growth has created pressure on WEF Nexus resource and environmental configurations, leading to substantial pollutant generation alongside the pursuit of rapid GDP growth, affecting living environments.

Previous studies have focused on the current electricity load demand (ELD) of Port Renewable Energy Systems (PRESs) without considering the impact of the growing transportation demand on such load. They also overlooked the electricity supply condition of the national grid (e.g., strong, weak or no presence) at ports and whether a PRES operates under an on-grid (ONG, connected with the national grid) or off-grid (OFFG) mode. This study proposes a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) method for planning PRESs that considers growing transportation demand and system constraints, including budget, carbon reduction targets, safety margins with other port equipment, and system reliability under multiple design scenarios. The first step within the proposed method is to forecast hourly ELD based on the estimated transportation demand of the specified planning period and historical hourly ELD data. The second step is to determine the “lowest” self-sufficiency rate (SSR) of the port electricity system, which is determined by the carbon reduction target of the port under study and set by its administration. The above two numbers are then used to estimate the “minimum” capacity of the PRES based on the total ELD of the port and the SSR. Then, the proposed MIP method is applied for planning PRESs under various design scenarios, including the presence of a strong or weak national grid (SNG or WNG) conditions, under ONG or OFFG modes, and with/without storage devices. Finally, the impact of different design schemes of PRESs and related choices of devices on its Rate of Investment (ROI), SSR, and system reliability are also analyzed. A case study of a container port on the eastern coast of China shows that, under the ONG scenario without any storage device, excessive renewable energy can be sold to the national grid, making its economic benefits superior to the OFFG scenario. The ROI for the ONG operation is 38.73% and 35.91% higher than the OFFG operation with the storage equipment in the case of SNG and WNG, respectively. Under the OFFG scenario, installing energy storage equipment reduces power abandonment costs and increases the consumption of renewable energy, making its environmental benefits superior to its counterpart under the ONG operation. Under the OFFG operation with the SNG and WNG scenarios, the PRES is configured with 3.6MW and 80MW energy storage devices, respectively, resulting in an average annual SSR that is 0.85% and 3.06% higher than that of its counterpart under the ONG operation, respectively. Under the WNG scenario, designing the PRES with an energy storage of 48MW can increase the reliability of the power supply from 19.92% to 90.05%. According to the findings of this study, the proposed method is effective in generating satisfactory infrastructure plans for the PRES under multiple design scenarios.

First of all, considering the profit of EV charging station, the charging cost of EV users and power loss, a multi-objective optimal scheduling model of EV charging, power grid, pumped hydro-storage (PHS) and wind farm is constructed, which is improved from the aspect of wind farm wake. Then, the multi-objective optimization algorithm based on genetic algorithm is used to solve the model to realize the optimal charging of EVs. Finally, the IEEE-13 power grid is used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi-objective optimal scheduling model.

In this study, a novel liquid CO2 mixture energy storage system coupled with a coal-fired power plant is proposed to broaden the liquefiable ambient temperature range, where condensate and feedwater without phase change are used for compression heat recovery and CO2 mixture heating. Firstly, eight refrigerant additives are selected to blend with CO2; then, comparative performance analysis between CO2 mixtures and pure CO2 is conducted, followed by parametric studies; finally, a double-layer decision-making framework based on multi-objective optimization is adopted for additive screening across various ambient temperatures. The results show that a moderate amount of additive favors system safety but degrades thermodynamics and economy, well at high temperatures the performance of CO2 mixture improves and absolutely outperforms pure CO2. CO2/difluoromethane (CO2/R32) reduces the system operating pressure by 20.95 % over pure CO2 at ambient temperature of 298.15 K, accompanied by only 5.78 %, 0.76 % and 9.92 % deterioration in round-trip efficiency, energy storage density and levelized cost of electricity, and exhibits optimal adaptation to varying additive mass fraction. The working fluid unit cost and heat exchangers are the main factors causing these variances. In response to environmental changes, CO2/propylene (CO2/R1270) and CO2/R32 emerge as the two most adaptable mixtures, with the former preferred at low ambient temperatures (288.15–293.15 K) and the latter at high ambient temperatures (298.15–308.15 K).

To tackle the issue of inaccurate estimation of the schedulable capacity of EVs in existing research, a high temporal resolution dynamic spatiotemporal distribution simulation model for EVs is developed. Furthermore, leveraging the characteristics of the power-transportation coupling network (PTCN), a sub-districted dynamic electricity pricing (DEP) is proposed to assist in improving the PDN node voltage distribution. Subsequently, an incentive coefficient is introduced to incentivize the discharge of EVs during potential peak periods. The proposed CDO strategy, considering the non-cooperative behavior of EV owners (EVOs), can provide personalized charge-discharge plans for them. The temporal sequence experiments reveal a significant decrease in the peak-to-valley disparity of the load, achieving an optimization rate of load mean square error that exceeds 80%. The sub-districted DEP exhibits a significant advantage in maintaining PDN voltage stability compared to traditional time-of-use electricity pricing (TOUEP) and DEP, while also achieving reductions in active power losses of more than 15% and 10% for PDN, respectively.

Regions can provide a common framework and support local action, in particular through ad-hoc or mainstreamed mitigation and adaptation strategies. Despite this, their contribution to multi-level climate planning is still little explored in the scientific literature. This work proposes a methodological framework developed to comprehensively assess the climate efforts of regional governments, based on three dimensions: ambition, robustness, implementation and progress. Ambition qualifies the regions' commitment. Robustness assesses the evidence-based approach of the plan and its link with the regional sustainable development strategy, as well as the regions’ involvement in transnational networks. Implementation and progress, records the availability of indicators to provide evidence of the actions taken, monitor progress, and inform stakeholders. Applying the proposed methodology to the Italian multi-regional case study sheds light on the weaknesses that limit the impact of climate action, while defining the factors that enhance climate performance. The results show that transnational networks can raise the level of ambition for mitigation, but less so for adaptation, where there are no quantitative targets or fixed target years. A science-based approach and a strong link to the regional sustainable development strategy provide a good degree of robustness, while tracking implementation and progress remains the most challenging factor.

The raw material extraction stage of cotton can be divided into two stages: the cotton cultivation-harvesting stage and the ginning stage. During the cultivation stage, cotton plants exhibit a carbon sequestration effect due to photosynthesis, and the biomass produced is ultimately transferred to seed cotton and cotton straw. In this study, quantitative models for carbon sequestration effect during the raw material extraction stage were established based on the carbon sequestration pathways of cotton plants and three treatment methods of cotton straw. The CF allocation principles between main and by-products have been determined as economic relationships and mass relationships. Based on these four carbon sequestration models and two allocation relationships, six different scenarios were proposed to optimize the CF of producing 1 ton of cotton lint during this stage. Results indicate that the CF of 1 ton of cotton lint harvested during the raw material extraction stage was negative in all six scenarios, suggesting carbon reduction. Converting cotton straw into biomass fuel after harvesting sequesters more carbon compared to crushing and returning it to the field. Economic allocation results in a higher CF value for cotton lint compared to mass allocation. The primary contributors to the CF of cotton lint are fertilizer, electricity, and agricultural films.

The clusters do show substantial differences in the changes in car ownership that occur while being an active car sharing member as well as the likelihood to use car sharing in place of a private car rather than public transport or walking and biking. We conclude that a comprehensive segmentation method based on socio-demographic variables provides actionable insights for upscaling car sharing adoption, as well as targeting specific user segments in order to optimize societal outcomes from car sharing use.

The mediating role of human capital and the moderating role of government attention ";" The problem of low innovation efficiency in developing countries has gained increasing attention, although there is little empirical evidence to examine this issue, especially from a haze pollution perspective. To fill this critical gap, this paper employs a series of empirical methods to investigate the impact of haze pollution on innovation efficiency and takes a panel dataset covering 30 provincial-level regions in China over 2010–2018 as a case study. Results show that: (1) An increase in haze pollution has an inhibitory effect on China's provincial innovation efficiency, whether for the overall, R&D, and commercialization efficiency. (2) Such a negative effect is exacerbated in provinces with low levels of urbanization and financial development, presenting a preference for poor territories. (3) Regarding spatial spillover effects, innovation efficiency in a given province is negatively correlated with haze pollution from neighboring provinces. (4) Regarding mediating factors, haze pollution reduces human capital and subsequently can inhibit innovation efficiency, i.e., the “human capital loss effect”. (5) Regarding moderating factors, rather than a “cost following effect”, government attention mitigates the inhibiting effect of haze pollution on innovation efficiency through an “innovation compensation effect”. In general, policymakers should seek a win-win situation between innovation activities and environmental protection.

This literature reaches the conclusion that alternative construction materials should be used to reduce the environmental impact of buildings. While such research provides essential knowledge on the carbon footprint of the housing sector, few studies take into account the economic side of the issue. This paper addresses this gap by calculating the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) of houses and matching the results with the LCA stages. The methodology is developed for two reference houses in Belgium. Considering all elements and materials used in the construction process, this approach allows a comparison of each house's elements based on the required investment to abate their carbon footprint. The most striking results are that (1) the operational stage (i.e., the use of houses) accounts for about 65% of the total carbon impact of a house; (2) a 1€ investment in sustainable materials induces a drop of 1–1.3 kgCO2eq; (3) this effect is heterogeneous across materials, with the highest returns obtained for external walls (−6 KgCO2eq) and windows (−3 to −6 kgCO2eq) and the lowest returns obtained for ground floor (−0.3 kgCO2eq).

This study proposes a “Domain-to-Point” approach to enhance deep learning models for extended 120-h PM2.5 forecasting. We used convolutional autoencoders (ConvAEs) to extract regional meteorological features (RMFs) from both surrounding and future meteorological data provided by an advanced weather forecasting system. The RMFs and temporal indicators were used as predictor variables in a time-attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory neural network to forecast the next 24- to 120-h PM2.5. For four megacities in China, the ConvAEs compressed the high-dimensional meteorological data into a lower-dimensional representation, while preserving most of the relevant information (R 2 > 0.75). Using the RMFs as inputs substantially mitigated the performance decay of the PM2.5 forecasting models over extended forecast spans, enabling accurate longer-term forecasting, with R 2 improvements of 14.7–79.2% for the 120-h forecasts. This study further revealed that errors in the meteorological forecasts are the primary cause of performance decay, suggesting that improving the accuracy of meteorological forecasts could be an effective approach for enhancing PM2.5 forecasting performance. With Beijing as a case study, model interpretation using the Shapley-additive-explanations method demonstrated the crucial role played by RMFs in accurately forecasting a typical air pollution episode and identifying the main meteorological factors affecting pollution. The proposed “Domain-to-Point” approach enhances the capability of deep learning models for longer-term PM2.5 forecasting, thus facilitating the development of preventative measures to safeguard public health against air pollution.

However, existing models are limited in their ability to analyse technology adoption and the impact of policy interventions in generating sufficient demand to reduce cost in the face of uncertainty. Such a model is vital for assessing policy-instruments for the implementation of future uncertain energy scenarios. We formulate a novel robust market potential assessment problem under uncertainty to support low carbon technology adoption, resulting in policies that are more immune to uncertain factors. We demonstrate two case studies: the potential use of carbon capture and storage for iron and steel production across the EU, and the transition to hydrogen from natural gas in steam boilers across the chemicals industry in the UK. We show that when parameters are jointly 5% uncertain, the robust policy for CCUS adoption results in a 40% increase in cost. Each robust optimisation problem is solved using an iterative cutting planes algorithm which enables existing models to be solved under uncertainty. By taking advantage of parallelisation we are able to solve the nonlinear robust market assessment problem for technology adoption in times within the same order of magnitude as the nominal problem. Our model demonstrates the possibility of locating robust policies for the implementation of low-carbon technologies, as well as providing direct insights for policy-makers into the decrease in policy effectiveness that results from increasing robustness. The approach we present is extensible to a large number of alternative technology adoption problems under uncertainty.

However, concerns have arisen regarding the lower durability of cold-mix asphalt when exposed to various environmental stressors, leading to the formation of cracks. This paper explores the benefits of a hybrid application of coarse and powdered slag to enhance crack healing in cold-mix asphalt through the use of microwave radiation. To do so, we quantified extent of microwave-induced healing in dry, wet and freeze-thaw conditioned cold mix asphalt containing steel slags. Latter healing is facilitated by heat generated via absorption of electromagnetic waves. Heat distribution within the specimens and crack zone found to be more uniform when the coarse slag (>4.75 mm) was supplemented with slag powder (∼0.075 mm) as evidenced by thermography analysis. It was further found that freeze-thaw conditioned specimens significantly benefited from microwave-induced healing as evidenced by a 74% recovery in semi-circular bending strength. This enhancement is attributed to the increased diffusion and contact area at heated crack surfaces. Overall, microwave treatment of cold mix asphalt specimens showed an increase in binder wettability and aggregate coating, resulting in improved performance. Notably, the most significant improvements were observed in the stiffness modulus, with increases of 23%, 46%, and 70% for dry, wet, and freeze-thaw conditioned specimens, respectively. Study outcomes support the vision toward the NetZero carbon emission pavements by promoting the durability of cold-mix asphalt to be a viable alternative to hot-mix asphalt.

The expansive use of nationally distributed and heterogeneous marginal lands is prone to widespread concerns about sustainability risks at all stages. We utilized a productivity-based suitability index to classify marginal land and examined net energy value (NEV) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under various marginal land development scenarios through extending system boundary from input of field production to energy consumption. We found that marginal lands with high suitability are concentrated in the Northeast, East, and Central China, while marginal lands in the Northwest and Southwest are generally unsuitable for bioenergy crops. The seed and chemical inputs in agricultural production and the enzyme and electricity consumption in ethanol production account for 79–89% of the total energy inputs, while GHG emissions are dominated by the nitrogen fertilizers to marginal land and electricity consumption in ethanol production. Half of the NEV and reduction in GHG emissions can be obtained by only developing high suitability marginal area, which account for 25% and 14% of the total available marginal land under low and high input scenarios. Whereas, low-yielding fields concentrated in the Southwest can bring serious negative environmental returns.

In this regard, the aim of this article is to analyse the role that women directors are playing in business transparency in energy matters and whether their role is determined by the level of gender parity that characterizes the countries of origin of the companies analysed. The academic and practical interest in these relationships is based on various theoretical frameworks that indicate gender equality is closely associated with greater concern for systems and elements in situations of real vulnerability, generating organizational changes aligned with these concerns. For a sample of 8757 companies based in 65 countries, we observed that gender parity at the country level positively affects the information that companies report regarding their energy transition strategy towards more responsible models that help mitigate climate change. We also identified a mediating effect of board gender diversity on this relationship. The findings are robust to changes in methodological specifications.

Forest carbon sink play a crucial role in mitigating climate change, with soil being a key component of forest ecosystem carbon pools. Both carbon source and carbon sink in forest soils have attracted significant academic interest. This paper uses bibliometrics to review and compare studies on forest soil carbon sink and source from January 1996 to April 4, 2024, divided into three stages, namely initial (1996-2004), middle (2005-2014), and late (2015-2024) stages. We found that publications on forest soil carbon source far exceed those on carbon sink, with a significant correlation in their trends. The United States leads in publication numbers, while the United Kingdom has greater centrality. Chinese institutions dominate in publication numbers, excelling in collaborative research. In forest soil carbon sink research, the top ten most-cited articles focus on climate change, soil respiration, and large-scale surveys. For forest soil carbon source, the focus is on climate change and soil organic matter. The research on carbon sink lags behind carbon source, and many hotspot issues remain unresolved. Over the three periods, studies on forest soil carbon sink and source have advanced in technological methods, greenhouse gases, ecosystem types, and ecosystem processes and functions. This study provides data to assist researchers in designing targeted and practical project schemes, while guiding policymakers to prioritize support for high-potential forest soil carbon projects, ultimately enhancing fund utilization efficiency.

Addressing this issue hinges on a thorough investigation into the mechanism governing its high-temperature emissions. This study employed microscale testing methods to analyze the microstructure and chemical property disparities between CRMA and base asphalt (BA). Subsequently, the impacts of varying crumb rubber (CR) content, experimental temperature, and sulfur stabilizer dosage on the high-temperature emissions of CRMA were investigated. Furthermore, comparative analyses of the molecular weight distribution, emission species, and CR crosslink density in asphalt after the fume experiment were conducted to further elucidate the high-temperature emission mechanisms. Finally, molecular simulation techniques were employed to analyze the interactions between CR and the four fraction molecules of asphalt at the microscale. The results indicated that the fume release volume of CRMA initially decreased and then increased with the addition of CR, while both the experimental temperature and sulfur stabilizer content exhibited a positive correlation with emission volume. CR reduced the volatilization of some small molecular hydrocarbons in the BA by absorbing light fractions. Meanwhile, excessive swelling caused the crosslinking density of CR to decrease by 77 %, which led to the release of toxic substances. At 20% CR content, the overall emissions of CRMA achieve their lowest level; however, the emission of toxic gases does not diminish. Molecular simulations have also confirmed the above results, showing that there is a strong interaction between CR and the light fractions.

An organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) generates electricity by harnessing the thermal energy supplied by the hybrid heat generation system. Part of the produced electricity is utilized to meet the community's electricity needs, while another fraction powers a brackish water reverse osmosis unit (RO). The waste heat from the ORC is recovered to produce domestic hot water and to drive a membrane distillation (MD) unit for RO brine minimization. A multi-objective optimization of the proposed system is conducted using the NSGA-II algorithm and TOPSIS decision-making tool considering plant's overall energy efficiency, exergy efficiency, and the total exergoeconomic cost of the useful products as objective functions. The study's results indicate that the overall optimal solution is achieved using R1336mzz(Z), with corresponding energy efficiency, exergy efficiency and hourly exergoeconomic cost of 45.31%, 5.39%, and 87.68 €/h, respectively. Moreover, the unitary costs associated with the useful products are 0.207 €/kWh, 0.029 €/kWh, 0.683 €/m3, and 3.36 €/m3 for the produced electricity, domestic hot water, RO permeate and MD distillate, respectively. In terms of sustainability, the system is not only renewable-driven but also achieves a 21% reduction in brine discharge through heat recovery at the ORC condenser compared to single-stage RO desalination. Additionally, using R1336mzz(Z) with its low global warming potential of 2 significantly lowers CO2 equivalent emissions compared to R245-fa. Lastly, sensitivity analysis indicates that hybridization ratios of up to 80% can result in a 10.6% reduction in CO2 emissions originating from biomass combustion compared to biomass-only solutions.

Existing studies have identified critical primary suppliers, producers, and final consumers driving Hg emissions in global supply chains. However, the hotspots in the intermediate transmission stages of global supply chains remain unknown. This study reveals critical transmission sectors and transactions of global embodied Hg emissions during 1995–2022. Results show that the critical transmission sectors and transactions of global embodied Hg emissions have been moving from developed (e.g., Japan and Russia) to developing (e.g., China and India) economies. Critical transmission sectors were primarily concentrated in the metal products, transportation, machinery and equipment manufacturing, and construction industries. Domestic transactions were the primary transmission pathways for embodied Hg emissions, with nearly half of these being intra-sectoral transactions. These findings can help policymakers develop transmission-bound Hg reduction policies and multi-level cooperation to support joint Hg emission reduction.

This approach proves particularly meaningful in markets where the production of this biofuel aligns with sustainable practices. Understanding the alterations in the combustion process holds significance within these markets, contributing to informed decision-making and fostering environmentally conscious practices. In this context, it is widely known that highly ethanol blended fuels can provide benefits regarding suppression of knocking combustion in spark ignited engines if the quality of the base-fuel is not deteriorated to maintain octane ratings. However, the results of engine knocking investigations can be affected by two effects simultaneously. Firstly, ethanol has a beneficial effect on knock suppression due to its high enthalpy of evaporation compared to gasoline, which results in inner mixture cooling especially with direct injection. Secondly, ethanol can have beneficial effects on knock suppression by its decreased self-ignition tendency. This paper provides the set-up and results of an adapted engine testing procedure to diminish the effects of evaporation enthalpy during the knocking investigations of different highly ethanol blended fuels. The presented testing procedure at a single-cylinder research engine includes three technical steps: (1) the engine is equipped with a port fuel injection in stoichiometric operation for all tested fuels; (2) the engine is operated with constant speed of 1500 rpm and constant spark timing of 33° firing top dead center; (3) the engine is operated with fuel individual settings for the intake manifold gas pressure and intake manifold gas temperature. These parameters are adjusted to test all fuels with similar in-cylinder conditions at spark timing. The differing heating values of the fuels obviously result in differing engine loads. However, the presented testing procedure is aimed to achieve comparable in-cylinder conditions at spark timing without the effect of evaporation enthalpy. The novelty of the study lies in its adapted engine testing procedure that mitigates the cross-effects of fuel properties and operational conditions to isolate the true influences on knock occurrence. The paper provides a comprehensive description of the theoretical backgrounds, experimental set-up and post-processing procedures and also shows the results of the first measurement campaign.

The transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources is critical to meeting this target and the construction of large-scale renewable energy projects is booming. These developments bring economic benefits, but their size means they can also have environmental and social consequences. Rural landscapes are particularly vulnerable because they are expected to be at the forefront of new large-scale renewable energy developments. Such projects are complex and, although they might be socially acceptable, need to be managed and governed well if they are to proceed smoothly. Good governance incorporates fairness, trust and transparency, aspects that foster public acceptance for renewable energy projects. While social acceptance has attracted substantial research, little is known about the public's views on the governance of renewable energy megaprojects. In Australia, a continent with abundant solar radiation and space, large projects are novel and our study aimed to assess which good governance principles the public considers to be most important if megaprojects are to be approved for construction in remote Australia. This insight can complement state and investors views on governance. We carried out an Australia-wide online survey that included a best-worst scaling (BWS) experiment and received 2223 valid responses, using an ambitious 12,000-ha solar megafarm planned for remote northern Australia as a case study. The most important governance principal for respondents was taking responsibility for environmental risk, followed by benefits such as cheap energy and jobs for the local community - governance principles referred to as responsiveness and participation. Accountability if something goes wrong was also perceived as important, but mainly by those respondents who lived in the jurisdiction that is the proposed host of the solar megafarm, and less so by people living in other places of Australia. Perhaps surprisingly, the governance principles of transparency, fairness and the rule of law were considered to be less important. Adhering to national regulations was also affected by the location of respondents, with those living closer to the proposed megafarm being least concerned about adherence.";"2024-10-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624032979";"1";"Emissions Other"

This study investigates climate change stock market connectedness and spillover effects, focusing on quantile-frequency dependency. The study utilizes a novel quantile-frequency connectedness with seven MSCI climate change market indices and daily data from January 2014 to December 2022. The empirical analysis reveals that climate change stocks are highly interconnected across various market conditions, including bearish and bullish periods. Spillover effects have amplified during increased stock market turbulence, regardless of market directions. Short-term spillover effects have a stronger impact than long-term effects, regardless of market conditions. Climate change stock markets in Japan and the Asia Pacific consistently experience net shocks, while the United States, Europe, Emerging Markets (EM), North America, and the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) exhibit variations based on market conditions and timeframes. The study identifies events including the 2015 Paris Agreement, the 2016 US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2021 US rejoining of the Paris Agreement, and the 2022 Russian-Ukraine War that have influenced the dynamic connectedness and spillover of climate change markets. The analysis also reveals that increased investor attention to climate change leads to higher interconnectedness among climate change stock markets across various market scenarios. Moreover, global financial stress, economic policy uncertainty, geopolitical risk, global carbon emission futures, oil market uncertainty, and stock market uncertainty significantly impact the interdependence of climate change markets. The findings have implications for portfolio managers, emphasizing the need for hedging techniques to mitigate risks in climate change markets.

Molecular sieves such as homogeneous porous powders possess the potential to suppress asphalt fume. However, the effective reduction of asphalt emissions via porous materials is limited owing to the lack of understanding of their absorption mechanism. This study investigated a series of molecular sieve powders (3A, 5A, 10X, 13X, NaY, MCM-41-Al and MCM-41-Si) for fume suppression, including their micromorphology, pore characteristics, pollutants emission concentrations, organic volatile compositions, and rheological properties by comparing pristine asphalt and the molecular sieves modified asphalt. The results indicated that molecular sieves could effectively suppress 69.5–83.2% of volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions and absorb nearly all the NO, H2S, and SO2. Adsorption mechanism of asphalt fume by molecular sieves was mainly depends on polarity of molecules size and relationship. Pollutants with higher polarity could be well absorbed. Pore size of molecular sieves needed to be slightly larger than the width of targeted pollutant molecules to absorb them and suppress the emissions. This study attributed molecular characteristics of the main pollutants, the adsorption mechanism of porous materials and effective asphalt fume reduction with molecular sieves, which supports future research on practical technologies for asphalt fume suppression.

A modeling-based approach is developed to compute and monetize reduction in heating and cooling energy transmittance, greenhouse gas emissions, and premature mortality associated with the decrease in the outdoor fine particulate matter. Linear regression models of energy prices, carbon pricing, and a value per statistical life approach quantify these benefits monetarily. Factors like upgrade type, dwelling window-to-wall ratio, deterioration in energy performance, geographic location, and window placement by orientation are analyzed for their impact on benefits. A case study examining two locations in the province of Ontario, Canada, is carried out. Results show that energy bill saving is sufficient to justify investing in windows with energy-efficient recognition across all dwelling categories in Southern Ontario, though government rebates are necessary for some dwelling types opting to upgrade to the most energy-efficient models. In contrast, rebates are unnecessary in Northern Ontario for any upgraded models due to substantial energy bill savings.

Recently, linking offshore wind, hydrogen, and chemicals is proposed to address these challenges. However, there is a lack of a comprehensive techno-economic analysis of this nexus. This study, as one of the first attempts, performs the techno-economic analysis of 8 feasible offshore wind-hydrogen-chemical nexus routes, in which factors of technology, economics, and financial policy are considered. The research indicates that Route 7, which incorporates offshore wind power utilizing proton exchange membrane technology for hydrogen production and blends it with natural gas on offshore platforms, demonstrates the most cost-effective outcome. The key factors influencing the cost reduction of these routes encompass the green hydrogen price, capital costs, internal rate of return, electricity price, value-added tax rate, and loan ratio. Among these, the green hydrogen price is the primary determinant influencing the cost of green products. If the price of green hydrogen decreases to 2.19 USD/kg, green synthetic ammonia can meet the current standard of 605.47 USD/t. Finally, the results can provide important reference to support stakeholders for seeking cost-effective routes of offshore wind-hydrogen-chemical nexus in China and other regions.

However, current research on the overall impact of the spatial patterns of urban green-blue landscape on carbon sequestration benefits is insufficient. Focused on the central urban area of Nanjing, with the years 2000, 2010, and 2020 as the study periods, the correlation among the spatial patterns of urban green-blue landscape and carbon sequestration amounts were explored using eXtreme Gradient Boosting - SHapley Additive exPlanations model.

The social constraints of the model provides a transparent depiction of labour needs in dynamic business landscape and foster women’s empowerment through a preference coefficient. The proposed model introduces a new upside risk measures under fuzzy-stochastic setting to quantify the upward financial risk. To characterize and manage the model uncertainty, a fuzzy-stochastic distributional robust model is presented. Credibility distribution is utilized to handle fuzzy uncertainty, while box and polyhedral uncertainty sets are included to handle stochastic uncertainty. After that, tractable deterministic formulations of the uncertain model for two ambiguity sets are presented to solve the model.

The results revealed that node-weighted degree centrality in the asset association networks of high energy-consuming enterprises, particularly in the guarantee association network, significantly increased default risk. Further mechanistic analysis reveals that the level of green technical cooperation innovation mitigates the impact of increased weighted degree centrality on the default risk of high energy-consuming enterprises.

Recognizing the pressing need to address the environmental footprint of the widely used construction materials, there is a growing focus on strategic initiatives that involve incorporating alternative waste materials to partially substitute ordinary Portland cement (OPC). It is also noteworthy that high-performance concrete and mortar emits significantly less CO2 per unit of strength. Therefore, this study aims to develop high-strength mortar mixes incorporating pumice powder (PP) and ground granulated blast-furnace slag (GGBS) as substitutes for OPC. To this end, nine different mixes, with varying levels of OPC replacement ranging from 0% to 60%, were produced.

The widespread recognition of net primary productivity (NPP) as a valuable tool for simulating regional shifts in vegetation carbon sequestration dynamics is evident. In this study, we explore the constraints and prospects for carbon sequestration in these sensitive ecological areas by leveraging NPP analysis. A model to evaluate the relative contributions of climate change (CLC) and land use change (LUC) to carbon sequestration variability was developed, providing quantitative insight into their respective impacts within these zones. Our research revealed a significant upwards trend in NPP across the study area, with an annual increase of 3.73 gC·m−2 year−1. Notably, the Southwestern Karst Area and the Loess Plateau Area experienced the greatest increases, at rates of 9.68 gC·m−2 year−1 and 6.95 gC·m−2 year−1, respectively. This growth exhibited a geographical gradient that was more pronounced in the southeast and diminished toward the northwest, although the Northwest Arid Area was an exception, where the spatial trend of NPP primarily showed a downwards trajectory. This suggests resilience and the potential for enhanced carbon capture in these ecologically sensitive areas. This study identified CLC and LUC as key drivers of NPP increases, with their multiyear average impacts measured at 0.69 gC·m−2 year−1 and 1.03 gC·m−2 year−1, respectively, generally yielding positive effects.

This shift has led to the development of green production planning models, attracting considerable attention in recent years. Previously, energy consumption or carbon emission were the most considered green parameters in the production planning problems. Nevertheless, several other essential green aspects such as reductions in chemical, solid waste, and wastewater are usually neglected. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-objective model for environmentally conscious aggregate production planning, simultaneously considering the above-mentioned green objectives. Additionally, the uncertain parameters of the model, including the green parameters, were modelled through fuzzy programming. Furthermore, this study incorporated a contradicting relationship between energy consumption cost and associated carbon emission, which was previously presented as non-contradicting. This relationship was illustrated by utilizing the time-of-use electricity tariff scheme. To solve the model, the initial step involved the defuzzification of uncertain attributes, followed by the transformation of the multi-objective model into a single-objective model.

The generated production plan achieved an overall satisfaction level of 71%, which is reasonably acceptable to the decision maker. Moreover, sensitivity analysis has been conducted for the degree of optimism of the objective functions and the feasibility degree of the constraints.

While the national carbon market has been launched and China has opted to give market-oriented policies a greater role in achieving net zero, energy efficiency policies still constitute a significant portion of the policy mix. However, the substantial drawback of energy efficiency policies compared to carbon trading, the rebound effect, has made energy efficiency policies debatable. It is crucial to precisely understand the magnitude of the rebound effect to design and implement effective energy policies. Our study estimates and compares the direct energy rebound and output expansion effects in China's manufacturing and service sectors using firm-level data from 2013 to 2016 and employing panel regression analysis. We also analyze the impact of firm characteristics such as ownership status, geographical location, and industry type on enterprises' rebound effects. We found a 33.5% direct rebound effect and a 19.3% output expansion effect in the manufacturing sector. In the service sector, the direct energy rebound effect was 57.9%, a larger one than the manufacturing sector. We also estimate direct energy rebound effects for key manufacturing and service enterprises. Our findings reveal that key manufacturing enterprises exhibit a larger rebound effect compared to the overall manufacturing sector, while key service enterprises show a smaller rebound effect than the overall service sector. Public, foreign, and heavy service enterprises show a smaller energy rebound effect, while northeastern manufacturing and service enterprises exhibit a larger rebound effect. We suggest that China's carbon market should also cover key service enterprises. For those below the threshold, enhancing energy management is essential to mitigate the rebound effect.

The purchase tax exemption for new small-displacement vehicles has a moderating effect. Considering China's uneven economic development, the influence of gasoline prices on new vehicle registrations gradually diminishes as regional residents' incomes rise. Gasoline prices are used by regulators to guide the restructuring of vehicle consumption, thereby helping to mitigate urban environmental problems.

This paper utilizes the time-varying Difference-in-Differences (DID) model to evaluate the causal effect of digital transformation on HEC within China's households. We find that HEC is positively impacted by digital transformation, as embodied by the ""Broadband China"" strategy; and the results remain reliable when many robustness tests are taken into account. Specifically, digital transformation has the potential to indirectly increase HEC by consumption upgrade and internet development mechanisms. The heterogeneity analysis reveals that the impact of digital transformation on HEC varies significantly across different household and regional. High-income, low skilled, rural areas, as well as households in areas with higher levels of development and marketization, are more likely to be affected by the digital revolution in production and consumption, which will inevitably lead to an increase in HEC. These insights are crucial for developing effective strategies to reduce HEC and promote sustainable development.

Evidence from China's Pilot Free Trade Zones ";" As a testing ground for China's institutional opening-up, Pilot Free Trade Zones (PFTZs) are of great significance in shaping a new global economic governance framework, addressing pollution and carbon reduction challenges, and fostering green economic development and transition. This study empirically assesses the influence of PFTZs establishment on urban green development (GD) using panel data from 284 Chinese cities between 2007 and 2020, using the asymptotic Difference in Differences (DID) method. The results indicate that the creation of PFTZs greatly encourages cities to develop green sustainably. In comparison to cities without PFTZs, the presence of PFTZs results in a notable average increase of 9.5% in urban green total factor productivity (GTFP). The impact of PFTZs on urban GD varies significantly across different geographical areas and city resource endowment conditions. Institutional innovation has a positive moderating effect on the PFTZs' promotion of urban GD. The influence mechanisms that PFTZs support urban GD mainly include the effects of green innovation, economic agglomeration, and environmental regulation. This paper provides crucial policy insights for advancing PFTZ construction, promoting urban green growth, and ultimately achieving the coexistence of human beings and nature in harmony.

Based on a sample of 28,402 firm-year observations from 60 countries between 2010 and 2018, the results show that natural capital negatively affects companies’ environmental responsibilities. In particular, the availability of non-renewable natural capital leads firms to overexploit resources, leading to weaker engagement in environmental activities. We also show that the Paris Agreement in 2015 improved the focus of firms operating in natural capital–rich countries on environmental responsibility. Further evidence shows that the influence of natural capital on corporate environmental responsibility is more prevalent for firms in developing countries and manufacturing industries. This negative effect also holds for the emission-reduction and resource-use subdimensions of environmental responsibility. However, renewable natural capital positively affects environmental innovation. Our results are robust to endogeneity concerns.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology has been widely adopted to estimate the environmental impacts associated with GCHP systems, with operational electricity consumption being the largest contributor among most categories. Given the data-intensive nature of LCA, operational electricity consumption should be prioritised to refine the accuracy of LCA results. Previous studies, however, have relied on static COP (Coefficient of Performance) and annual average data to obtain the environmental impacts and have disregarded the effect of long-term performance degradation caused by building thermal load imbalances. In this paper, to bridge this research gap, a dynamic operational environmental impact assessment (DOEIA) method was proposed to improve the precision of LCA results by incorporating higher temporal resolution data of electricity mix and real-time performance modelling of the reversible GCHP system. Impacts of different temporal resolutions (i.e. monthly, trimestral, and annual) on the accuracy of LCA results was examined and the operational performance degradation resulting from imbalanced building heating and cooling loads was considered. Results demonstrate that while performance degradation effects are evenly distributed across impact categories, gaps due to temporal resolutions vary significantly between different categories. Subsequent analysis of spatial variations in the latter further emphasises the importance of accounting for higher temporal resolutions. Finally, life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) results for reversible GCHP systems in different locations were obtained with the support of DOEIA method and the results underscore the necessity of a cleaner energy mix. The proposed DOEIA method can be applied to other energy systems for comparative analyses. It is replicable in other countries and regions and therefore is expected to provide methodological guidance for future decision-makers.

However, due to the challenges associated with data collection these can still suffer from issues including representation accuracy, comparability, data availability, data quality, and uncertainty. This paper describes a new streamlined, high-level framework which seeks to solve these issues through rigorous and iterative application of existing standardised LCA methodologies whilst continually engaging with stakeholders. This new framework has been applied to an aviation case study, which seeks to investigate the potential environmental impact of implementing sustainable aviation fuel (including fuels based on used cooking oil, power to liquid technology, and hydrogen) and digitalisation of training regimes within a UK aircraft manufacturer. These are currently major areas of focus to enable the decarbonisation of the global aviation sector. The proposed framework allowed for efficient joint interpretation of results by different stakeholders, and therefore enabled effective strategic decision making without requiring the granular level of data detail demanded by conventional LCA frameworks. The case study has shown that each scenario offers potential reductions in global warming potential, fine particulate matter formation, and water consumption for an aircraft; but only when the associated supply chain is just as sustainable as the scenario in question. Overall, this research has shown that applying the new framework allows for rapid evaluation of decarbonisation technologies through rigorous environmental assessment to a degree accuracy which still enables strategic decision making, but without the use of unnecessary resources. Although this framework has been developed to work across product, platform, or system, further work should seek to apply it in different contexts as a LCA enabler within technological developments including exploration of other aviation decarbonisation pathways to achieve net zero.";"2024-09-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624028890";"3";"Emissions Other"

Employing agglomeration economic theory and extending the panel model to the spatial dimension, this study examines the agglomeration and spatial spillover effects of financial and manufacturing co-agglomeration on China's green economy efficiency (GEE), utilizing panel data spanning 2003 to 2019 across 285 cities. First, we found that the spatial distribution of financial and manufacturing co-agglomeration presents a ladder-like feature from inland regions to coastal areas through exploratory spatial and temporal analysis. Second, by using the spatial Durbin model, we found that financial and manufacturing co-agglomeration significantly enhances local GEE, it also provides a positive spatial spillover effect on the GEE of neighboring areas, mainly through geographic channels. Third, employing the mediation effect model, we also found that financial and manufacturing co-agglomeration promotes GEE through technological innovation, enhanced market potential, and reduced carbon emissions. Fourth, the threshold effect analysis shows that appropriate government intervention positively promotes financial and manufacturing co-agglomeration in enhancing GEE, while excessive intervention hinders GEE growth. With greater openness to the outside world, financial and manufacturing co-agglomeration significantly promotes GEE. Moreover, the level of financial development has a U-shaped threshold effect, impeding and then boosting GEE. Furthermore, financial and manufacturing co-agglomeration in eastern and central regions and non-resource-based cities has a significant positive direct effect and spatial spillover effect on GEE.

This is particularly crucial in addressing global climate change and achieving carbon neutrality. This paper focuses on 108 cities within the Yangtze River Economic Belt in China, employing the Generalised Spatial Two-Stage Least Squares (GS2SLS) method to conduct an in-depth analysis of the impact of manufacturing agglomeration on green development performance. This study finds that, at the current stage, manufacturing agglomeration can effectively promote green development performance; however, the impact exhibits a U-shaped relationship. This means that the effect of manufacturing agglomeration on green development performance initially decreases and then increases. Additionally, knowledge spillover effects, resource allocation effects, and structural upgrading effects are important channels contributing to this nonlinear relationship. Extended analysis reveals that in the cities of the lower Yangtze River region, there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between manufacturing agglomeration and green development performance, while in the middle and upper reaches, the relationship is U-shaped. Furthermore, the expansion of city size positively promotes the green development effects of manufacturing agglomeration.

The present study investigated the relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and various air pollutants, urbanization, surface indices, and meteorological parameters, which are associated with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially Goal 13 (Climate Action) and Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities). The effect of air pollution on LST across seasons was also examined for five years (2018–2022). LST images collected from MODIS satellite. Data on air pollutants and meteorological parameters were collected from air quality monitoring stations. The results showed that PM2.5 exceeded the WHO guidelines. A weak or moderate relationship was observed between LST and individual air pollutants. However, the association significantly improved when all air pollutants were considered simultaneously. The relationship improved even further when additional parameters such as Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Digital Elevation Model (DEM), road line density (RLD), and global population density (GPD), were also included. The resulting relationship was very strong (R2 > 0.80) during the summer and winter seasons. The study identified that NH3 had a prominent influence on LST during winter, while PM2.5 and NH3 exhibited a higher influence during summer. The research findings emphasized that LST variations were influenced by both air pollutants and meteorological conditions, along with urbanization factors represented by various parameters and indices.

This paper explores the investment strategies and cooperative behaviors of developers and contractors from the perspective of government subsidies and further studies the conditions that affect the successful implementation of cost-sharing contracts between the developer and contractor. This study considers four decision-making scenarios: decentralized decision-making without government subsidies, decentralized decision-making with government subsidies, unilateral cost-sharing contract (UCC) with government subsidies, and bilateral cost-sharing contract (BCC) with government subsidies. The findings indicate that: (1) The contractor's LCT investment has a better optimization effect on CSC than the developer's LCP investment. (2) When only government subsidies are implemented, subsidizing contractors is more conducive to the optimization of CSC. When UCC and BCC are further introduced, subsidizing developers becomes more beneficial. Moreover, excessively high subsidy standards are not conducive to the sustainable development of CSC. (3) UCC and BCC both hold the potential for Pareto improvements within CSC, with success contingent upon specific conditions, and BCC tends to achieve better optimization than UCC.

The results of the study show that the development of the digital economy significantly improves the carbon efficiency level of Chinese cities. After a series of endogeneity and robustness tests, the conclusion still holds. Public environmental concern and technological innovation are the key mediating paths. In addition, the digital economy has a significant non-linear effect on the carbon efficiency of Chinese cities. On the one hand, the low-carbon effect of the digital economy is only realized when the level of digital economy development is lower than the critical value of 0.040 and higher than the critical value of 0.085; on the other hand, the lower the level of urban carbon efficiency is, the greater the effect of the digital economy on urban carbon efficiency. Further research shows that the digital economy has a significant spatial spillover effect on the improvement of urban carbon efficiency, and the development of the digital economy not only helps to improve the carbon efficiency level of the local city but also positively influences the improvement of the carbon efficiency of neighboring cities through the spatial spillover effect.

Consequently, many developed countries have set carbon-neutral targets for 2050, mandating that all new constructions thereafter be designed as net-zero emission buildings (NZEBs). To achieve this goal, one of the most practical sources of renewable energy, solar power, is employed in this study to estimate the economic feasibility of implementing NZEBs in the non-residential sector of the United States. While past studies have typically estimated the economic payback period of solar power technology by assuming fixed values for “PV energy conversion rates (%)” and “investment costs ($USD)”, this paper carefully investigated the economic feasibility of “solar-based NZEBs” by precisely tracking these dynamic future changes in PV panels. These techno-economic variables were carefully predicted using a statistical technique known as the five-parameter logistic (5 PL) function. The results show that Site 4 is the only solar region suitable for implementing “PV-integrated NZEBs”, reaching a payback period of 8.44 years in 2040 (Scenario 1). Furthermore, with small technological improvements in PV energy efficiency (%), buildings located in Site 3 and Site 4 can meet the net-zero emission target with payback periods of less than 10 years in 2034 (Scenario 2). Finally, starting in 2044, the “PV-integrated system” will have a payback period of approximately 7 years in most study locations, even without federal support for the solar investment tax credit (SITC).

(JCL) aligns with the national conditions of countries with food shortages and large populations, such as some countries in Africa and Asia, and is an ideal alternative to replace fossil fuels. Determining appropriate planting densities suitable for different regions is one of the most critical practices for agriculture and forestry to achieve high yields and sustainability. This study conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) of the JCL biodiesel's environmental impact, energy balance, and economic analysis (3E) of two densities and three of the most suitable planting regions in China. Findings reveal that the density of 2500 plants/ha had a better 3E performance than 1600 plants/ha, and Yunnan province outperformed Guizhou province and Sichuan province. JCL biodiesel effectively mitigates the greenhouse effect (1141.14–1936.59 kg CO2 eq/t) compared to conventional fossil diesel in different cases. Key factors influencing environmental performance include seed yield, urea applied during cultivation, methanol for biodiesel conversion, and electricity for irrigation. The Net Energy Balance (NEB) and Net Energy Ratio (NER) demonstrate the superior energy efficiency of JCL biodiesel over fossil diesel. The cost of producing JCL biodiesel decreased with the maturation of the trees, with water use and labor salary accounting for over 80% due to the necessity of the cultivation stage. Although the Financial Net Present Value (FNPV) was negative when considering only JCL biodiesel, it became positive (12111.64–27342.44 CNY) with the inclusion of by-products (glycerine, press-cake, and shells) in high-density cases. Our findings suggest that JCL biodiesel with appropriate density can serve as a sustainable biofuel alternative, replacing a portion of the fossil diesel currently on the market and significantly contributing to climate change mitigation and nonrenewable energy conservation.

Consequently, many developed countries have set carbon-neutral targets for 2050, mandating that all new constructions thereafter be designed as net-zero emission buildings (NZEBs). To achieve this goal, one of the most practical sources of renewable energy, solar power, is employed in this study to estimate the economic feasibility of implementing NZEBs in the non-residential sector of the United States. While past studies have typically estimated the economic payback period of solar power technology by assuming fixed values for “PV energy conversion rates (%)” and “investment costs ($USD)”, this paper carefully investigated the economic feasibility of “solar-based NZEBs” by precisely tracking these dynamic future changes in PV panels. These techno-economic variables were carefully predicted using a statistical technique known as the five-parameter logistic (5 PL) function. The results show that Site 4 is the only solar region suitable for implementing “PV-integrated NZEBs”, reaching a payback period of 8.44 years in 2040 (Scenario 1). Furthermore, with small technological improvements in PV energy efficiency (%), buildings located in Site 3 and Site 4 can meet the net-zero emission target with payback periods of less than 10 years in 2034 (Scenario 2). Finally, starting in 2044, the “PV-integrated system” will have a payback period of approximately 7 years in most study locations, even without federal support for the solar investment tax credit (SITC). Accordingly, federal support for solar power generation will be more effective if the SITC rate is gradually reduced by 2.5% annually starting in 2033.

Utilizing data from China's A-share listed companies spanning from 2014 through 2022, we investigate the causal relationship between air pollution and corporate allocation of financial assets. Using an instrumental variable approach, we find that worse air quality has a positive effect on corporate financial asset allocation. Specifically, a 1% increase in the number of air pollution days tends to result in a 0.002% increase in the share of financial assets held by firms. This effect prevails through diverse robustness tests. Furthermore, as companies encounter more stringent financing constraints and environmental regulations, the trend of air pollution promoting the increased financialization of assets becomes more pronounced. Based on the findings, this paper suggests providing more support for enterprises to facilitate the upgrading of production and operation to meet environmental standards.

Given their economic and ecological significance, plantation vineyards play a crucial role in assessing carbon sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems. Vineyards characterized by concentrated and continuous cultivation exhibit notable CO2 sequestration capacity, along with vital ecosystem service functions. The vineyard ecosystem effectively captured and stored substantial amounts of carbon within grapevines and soil, with soil microorganisms being pivotal for the formation, alteration, and fixation of soil organic carbon. To explore the carbon sequestration value of vineyards, this study systematically reviewed carbon flux and storage in vineyards, as well as both plant- and microbial-derived inputs of soil organic carbon. The sequestration mechanism of soil organic carbon, regulated by the soil microbial carbon pump was comprehensively examined. This included a focused exploration of the processes governing the formation and accumulation of soil microbial organic carbon, and the contribution of soil microbial necromass carbon to soil organic carbon. Additionally, the protective mechanisms of the mineral, aggregate, and biological sequestration of soil organic carbon were elucidated. This study provides a theoretical reference for advancing our understanding of soil organic carbon sequestration in vineyard ecosystems.

The reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to achieve the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to well below 2 °C is of paramount importance, as is planning for future climate change risks. Architects, as designers of the built environment hold an important role in advocating and enabling the necessary mitigation and adaptation actions required in the design and construction of new buildings, and the reuse of existing built fabric – to reduced embodied carbon and achieve operational energy efficiency. Despite the importance, most built environments do not yet adequately address climate change. Limited research has examined the barriers that architectural professionals encounter when integrating climate change action in their projects during their role designing built environments. This is the gap that this research addresses. Interviews with twenty-two Australian architectural practitioners were undertaken, to investigate their experience of barriers to and facilitators of climate change action in their professional practice. Four key themes were found: 1) actors, 2) processes and structures, 3) information and knowledge, and 4) the role of government. Barriers and facilitators were found to be embedded in architects' perception of their role, the processes and practices they undertake, and their relationship with other stakeholders. The facilitators identified can assist drive better outcomes for future design and construction of buildings. Recommendations identified include: 1) build architects' confidence and capability to be advocates; 2) develop of architects' climate change knowledge and competence; 3) transform design processes to be more circular, interdisciplinary and long term focused, and 4) reform current built environment policy to adequately consider climate change.";"2024-09-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624025988";"4";"Emissions Other"

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) approaches, which attempt to strike a balance between food security, climate change resilience, and agricultural carbon emissions, have achieved significant results in many parts of the world but are still in urgent need of replication in China. In this study, we developed a protector–victim–perpetrator (PVP) analytical framework to analyse the complex links between climate change and agricultural production for the first time and constructed the first climate-smart agriculture development index (CSADI) in China through a modified GPCA-EWM methodology. The evaluation results showed that the CSA development level in most provinces and regions in China continuously improved from 2010 to 2020 but that the overall level was still low, with only four provinces and regions reaching a highly distinct level. The development level of climate-smart agriculture in China was constrained by the insufficient adaptation of agriculture to climate change, the overreliance of most regions on the innate advantages brought about by resource endowment, and the lack of acquired management and protection. Food security was often negatively correlated with agricultural carbon emissions, but the potential for reducing carbon emissions was quite limited, with ecological degradation and livestock overload in Tibet being of particular concern. In summary, mitigating agricultural carbon emissions by improving adaptability, drawing a bottom line for natural resource protection, popularising climate-smart agricultural technologies, and cross-regional integrated ecological management will help enhance the development of climate-smart agriculture in China.

In this study, the possibility of utilizing low-calorific value biogas in a gas turbine (GT) combustor under various combustion conditions is numerically simulated, and techno-economic analysis of energy systems coupled with the GT combustor is conducted. Herein, two distinct energy systems utilizing different combustion modes for H2 production via PEM electrolyzer have been designed and examined. This investigation focuses on the impact of various influencing factors in oxy-fuel combustion mode, such as the equivalence ratio and the O2 content in the two types of oxidizers, on the rate of hydrogen production, power generation, energy/exergy efficiencies, and the economic index of the proposed energy system. Additionally, a suitable system for large-scale operation is identified among the presented systems. The findings of the study demonstrate that the energy system based on the O2/CO2 combustion mode exhibits a higher rate of hydrogen production compared to the O2/H2O combustion mode and particularly, within the equivalence ratio range of 0.55≤ϕ ≤ 0.85, the hydrogen production rate in the O2/CO2 combustion mode decreases from 5.16 kg/h to 3.72 kg/h.

Hydrogen compressors are drivers for hydrogen distribution, which has a direct effect on the performance of hydrogen networks. The existing works focus on the hydrogen network synthesis and often use simple compressor models for easy modelling and solving, which may lead to overly ideal results. This work proposes a novel mathematical method for refinery hydrogen network synthesis considering compressor performances, incorporating both centrifugal and reciprocating compressors. The compression power vs. volumetric flowrate curves and the compression ratio vs. volumetric flowrate curves are considered for a centrifugal compressor, while the efficiency of a reciprocating compressor is correlated with the compression ratio. A mixed integer nonlinear programming model (MINLP) is formulated to minimize the total annualized cost. The developed MINLP model is examined based on two hydrogen network cases reported in literature. The results show that the minimum total annualized cost is a co-optimization of compressor type, operating points, compressor placement, and hydrogen network structure. In the two cases, compression efficiencies of centrifugal compressors range from 0.760 to 0.795 and that of reciprocating compressors are between 0.539 and 0.807. The consideration of centrifugal compressors rather than just reciprocating compressors not only improves the compression efficiencies but also simplify the hydrogen network structures. Moreover, it also brings reductions in the compression power by 2.23% and 1.97%, and decreases in the compressor investment by 7.12% and 6.87%.

Fully utilizing bio-based materials, we developed a novel composite phase change material (PCM), A-WF/CO/h-BN, with high thermal storage properties designed for application in building envelopes. It incorporates coconut oil (CO) as the PCM featuring an optimal phase change temperature. Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) was chosen to enhance the thermal conductivity.

Results indicate that the proposed A-WF/CO/h-BN sample can effectively delay the heat transfer and inhibit the temperature rise and fall. For these superior properties, when the A-WF/CO/h-BN sample is applied in building envelopes, it can minimize the heat transfer from the envelope to the interior and inhibit indoor temperature fluctuation.

Additionally, systems with elevated PV panels (called PV Aglectric, Agrivoltaics, or Agrophotovoltaics) that allow for crop production underneath them can increase energy production and reduce carbon emissions with minimal impact on crop production.

However, the energy transition comes with challenges, as expanding renewable energy infrastructure requires significant land areas, which raises concerns about associated environmental impacts, particularly on species richness. The first system-wide life cycle assessment (LCA) approach that integrates multiple biodiversity models is presented, evaluating the current effects of renewable energy production and transmission in Norway. The impacts of Norwegian hydropower and onshore wind power plants are quantified, which contribute 98% of Norway's electricity generation. Additionally, the effects of power lines are included to assess the spatial origins of the biodiversity impacts derived from both energy production and transmission relative to where electricity was transmitted to and consumed in Norway. The analyses show that hydropower exerts the most substantial impact on species richness and that the electric grid affects mostly mammal richness due to habitat conversion and fragmentation. As energy production primarily originates in western-central and northern Norway, regions with low electricity generation, such as south-east Norway, import a substantial share of the biodiversity impacts for their energy consumption. However, integrating an international dimension is crucial, as multiple European countries exchange energy with Norway, and thus also contribute to the pressure on local species richness. The results present the current operational impacts on biodiversity caused by Norway's electricity system. Since Norway intends to increase its renewable energy production capacity in the coming decades, this approach can serve as an instrument for developing scenarios to assess the future construction of hydropower, onshore wind power, and power lines.

In particular, the subject of the study is the changes in the fuel structure of electricity generation (energy mix) and the changes in the concentration of energy generation. The analysis concentrates on Poland and Spain against the background of the group of EU27 countries. The study adopted a long-term perspective (1990–2020). The methodology used taxonomic measures of variability of structures and measures of concentration, as well as measures of descriptive and mathematical statistics. The result of the research proves that the EU common climate and energy policy has explicitly accelerated changes in the energy mix, both in the EU27 and in the studied countries, including those traditionally based on coal. The concentration analysis demonstrated an increase in diversification resulting in a significant increase in the share of renewable and low-carbon sources. The taxonomic analysis additionally proved that there was a parallel process towards making the energy mix of the studied countries more similar to the EU27.

It not only helps in reducing greenhouse gas emissions but also enhances food security by making the supply chain more resilient to climate-related disruptions, ensuring stable food production for a growing global population. Further, there is an increasing consumer demand for sustainably produced food, and meeting this demand is crucial for maintaining relevance and competitiveness in the global market. Without a well-functioning decarbonized supply chain, it would be much harder for farmers, processors, distributors, and retailers to promote food security and improve public health.

This paper compiles 152 climate neutrality policies issued by the European Commission (EU Commission) and employs a systematic analytical framework including ""Vertical Policy Hierarchy - Horizontal Policy Path – Systematic Policy instruments"" to conduct an in-depth analysis of the EU's climate neutrality policy system. This study produces several findings as follows: First, the EU's climate neutrality policy hierarchy is characterized by a structure comprising ""Long-Term Planning – Specific Measures - Financial Support"". Second, the EU's policy formulation process for climate neutrality emphasizes the integration of a multi-party engagement mechanism involving ""Nongovernmental Level - Regional Level - National Level - Transnational Level - Supranational Level"", while extensively employing a ""framework-content"" policy-making methodology. Third, the EU's climate neutrality governance is guided by the dual objectives of achieving a ""Cleaner Energy Structure"" and ""Recover Ecological Environment"" pursuing a broad-ranging and multi-tiered policy pathway towards climate neutrality. Fourth, the EU leverages a combined approach of mandatory measures and guiding policies to propel the climate neutrality governance process, aspiring to achieve breakthroughs in new energy technology innovation through climate neutrality governance, thereby solidifying its international standing. Moreover, this study provides an outlook on the future of the EU's climate neutrality policy governance, positing that the EU's emphasis on climate neutrality governance will remain undiminished, with a heightened focus on guiding policies and an emphasis on the roles of enterprises and the public in advancing the realization of climate neutrality.

Given limitations in the existing coal price forecasting research, this study introduces grey relational analysis to determine the relational grade between influencing factors and coal prices. Results indicate that crude oil production, CPI (Consumer Price Index), coal sales of key coal mines, and PMI (Purchasing Managers Index) exhibit the highest correlation with coal prices, with grey relational coefficients all exceeding 0.9. This study also applies principal component analysis to achieve data dimensionality reduction, resulting in a 2% decrease in average forecasting error. The influence-based forecasting model developed in this study demonstrates an average forecasting accuracy exceeding 90%. To render coal price forecast more practical, this study constructs several models based on time series to forecast the coal price for the subsequent 30 days. The results show that the BP (Back Propagation) neural network model demonstrates higher forecasting accuracy than the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model for 30-day coal price forecasting. The forecast generated by BP model closely match the actual coal price trends, achieving a high average prediction accuracy exceeding 85%. The accurate forecasting model of coal price proposed in this study holds significant importance in characterizing carbon price fluctuations, enhancing power plant flexibility in electricity generation, and guiding coal procurement.

LST and PM2.5 are closely related, and land use/cover change (LUCC) has a significant influence on them. However, there is a lack of multi-scale analysis of their relationship under the background of LUCC. Therefore, this study designed a multi-scale analysis framework, adopted the Pearson correlation analysis, bivariate Moran's I and coupling coordination degree (D) to examine the relationship between LST and PM2.5 in different land use types based on remote sensing data, and analyzed the influencing factors by Geodetector. The results showed that LST and PM2.5 have a positive correlation, and their correlation would decrease with the research scale expansion, with the absolute values of Moran's I ranging from 0.229 to 0.577, 0.415–0.754 and 0.551–0.852 at national, urban agglomeration and city scales, respectively. LST, PM2.5 and their correlation were lower in forest and water at the three scales, while they were the highest in construction land, and the difference in D values was about 0.3. Furthermore, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and construction land area played the most important role in spatial patterns of this relationship, followed by population and GDP.

Specifically, this study aims to identify factors that contribute to the urban-rural and regional MEP disparities in China. The results reveal that (1) MEP is widespread in China; (2) Rural areas experience 2.5 times more MEP compared to urban areas, while inland regions have 1.5 times higher MEP rates than coastal regions; and (3) these disparities are primarily caused by low-income levels, lack of non-agricultural employment opportunities, and educational attainment. Therefore, policies targeting low-income, unemployed, and less-educated individuals are necessary to address this issue. In addition, promoting urbanization and eliminating the household registration system are crucial steps to address MEP disparities in China.

Evidence from Chinese firms' off-site investments ";" The power of public environmental concern cannot be ignored. It is vital in promoting environmental legislation, corporate social responsibility, and sustainable development. Existing studies have discussed the positive governance effects of public environmental concern on environmental quality but have neglected the issue of environmental inequality due to pollution transfer resulting from differences in public environmental concern. We used the data from the off-site investment of Chinese heavy polluting firms to reveal the impact of public environmental concern on pollution transfer. Our research revealed that (1) Public environmental concern causes polluting firms to transfer out, thus generating the pollution transfer phenomenon. (2) Public environmental concern can cause pollution transfer through increased environmental penalties. From the perspective of external environmental incentives, market competition, market potential, and government environmental concern strengthen the positive influence of public environmental concern on pollution transfer. In terms of the intrinsic motivation of firms, risk-taking capacity, green innovation ability, and asset-stranding risk weaken the positive influence of public environmental concern on pollution transfer. (3) The public environmental concern is also characterized by “grasping the large and letting go of the small”. Public environmental concern remarkably induces pollution transfer when firms' environmental awareness is low and local government officials' political incentives are high. These findings help policymakers to place greater emphasis on the power of public concern. Moreover, they can further improve the pluralistic governance structure of environmental regulation.

They involve proton exchange membrane water electrolysis for H2 production, reverse water-gas shift reaction for syngas production, pressure swing adsorption for syngas purification, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis for diesel-range hydrocarbons from CO2, and atmospheric distillation for product separation. Plant B additionally integrates a hydrocracking-based upgrading section. The simulations were performed using Aspen Plus® v10, Aspen Adsorption® v10, and Aspen Custom Modeler® v10. The evaluation covers technical, economic, environmental, and multi-criteria assessment (GREENSCOPE). The proposed processes demonstrate the potential to convert CO2 to hydrocarbons, with carbon conversion rates of 75% and 71% for Plants A and B, respectively. Process energy intensity is 155 and 170 MJ/kgLP for Plants A and B, respectively. Environmental assessment reveals CO2 reduction, resulting in negative global warming potentials of −2.20 and −0.84 kgCO2-eq/kgLP for Plants A and B, respectively. The sustainability degree indices for Plants A and B are 1.00 and 0.06, respectively, indicating Plant A as the more sustainable process alternative based on both quantitative and qualitative metrics. Economic analysis shows project unviability in the Brazilian context due to reliance on H2 production and prevailing pricing conditions. Economic viability requires a price increase of liquid products by 266% and 302% or CO2-eq abatement costs ranging from 2.05 to 3.43 US$/kgCO2-eq for Plants A and B, respectively.

This paper presents and applies a fundamental bottom-up model that relies on techno-economic data of industrial production processes. Its aim is to identify, across a range of scenarios, the most cost-effective low-carbon options considering a variety of production systems. Subsequently, it derives the hydrogen and electricity demand that would result from the implementation of these least-cost low-carbon options in process industries in Germany. Aligning with the German government's target year for achieving climate neutrality, this study's reference year is 2045. The primary contribution lies in analyzing which hydrogen-based and direct electrification solutions would be cost-effective for a range of energy price levels under climate-neutral industrial production and what the resulting hydrogen and electricity demand would be. To this end, the methodology of this paper comprises the following steps: selection of the relevant industries (I), definition of conventional reference production systems and their low-carbon options (II), investigation and processing of the techno-economic data of the standardized production systems (III), establishment of a scenario framework (IV), determination of the least-cost low-carbon solution of a conventional reference production system under the scenario assumptions made (V), and estimation of the resulting hydrogen and electricity demand (VI). According to the results, the expected industrial hydrogen consumption in 2045 ranges from 265 TWh for higher hydrogen prices in or above the range of onshore wind-based green hydrogen supply costs, to up to 473 TWh for very low hydrogen prices corresponding to typical blue hydrogen production costs. Meanwhile, the direct electricity consumption of the process industries in the results ranges from 147 TWh for these rather low hydrogen prices to 338 TWh for the higher hydrogen prices in the region of or above the hydrogen supply costs from the electrolysis of energy from an onshore wind farm. Most of the break-even hydrogen prices that are relevant to the choice of low-carbon options are in the range of the benchmark purchase costs for blue hydrogen and green hydrogen produced from offshore wind power, which span between €40 per MWh and €97 per MWh.";"2024-08-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262401802X";"4";"Emissions Other"

To account for the noise mitigation achieved by the road surfaces, which is the main benefit compared to conventional road surfaces, the damage effect of traffic noise has been incorporated in both analyses. Thus, open source noise emission and propagation modelling and Geographical Information System (GIS) tools have been used to determine the noise level at which residents are exposed. The impact of noise emissions on human health is estimated and expressed in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and the related external cost have been calculated by monetarizing the environmental impacts and by integrating them within the cost assessment.

However, given time dependence of operational behavior, batch processes are more demanding in energy integration than continuous processes, a task which is especially important amid the global net zero-emission current. It is, therefore, imperative to develop sustainable design strategies for intermittent processes. The study introduced a targeting method and developed an innovative over-time heat integration technique to optimize energy utilization in batch processes, involving use of heat transfer media for heat recovery over various time intervals and a heat makeup strategy to heat the media over different periods, in order to enhance heat-energy utilization efficiency. The technique is applicable to both fixed and unspecified batch schedules, the latter of which involves simultaneous design of production schedule and heat recovery systems, increasing flexibility and improving heat energy utilization. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate the proposed method. With the heat makeup technique, energy efficiency can be significantly enhanced, achieving energy savings of 51% and 93.1% in hot and cold utility, respectively.

Carbon pricing, a strategy recognized for its potentially regressive nature, tends to disproportionately burden lower-income households compared to wealthier counterparts. This study examined how the choice of income or expenditure as metrics for assessing carbon burdens and ranking household economic status influences these distributional effects. Our research, employing input-output models and the Taiwan 2021 Survey of Family Income and Expenditure, compared these two metrics. The findings revealed that income-based assessments would amplify the regressive impact of carbon pricing. Conversely, using expenditure as the base for carbon burden exhibited markedly reduced regressive effects. Moreover, the study highlighted the role of employment structures in determining the equity of ranking households by income or expenditure. The stability of distributional outcomes, when employing expenditure as the assessment base, suggested its superiority as a metric unaffected by ranking methodologies. Additionally, our analysis indicated that including gasoline in carbon pricing policies could counteract the regressive nature of such policies. This aligned with a just transition by potentially distributing the burden more evenly across socio-economic groups. By providing insights into the distributional effects of carbon pricing, this study contributed to the global pursuit of net-zero emissions while adhering to the principles of social equity and justice.

In this study, we collected PM2.5 samples from two cities, Chengdu and Ya'an, which have different industrial structures in the Sichuan basin during wintertime and investigated the reasons behind their severe PM2.5 pollution. Throughout the entire sampling period, the average PM2.5 concentrations in Chengdu (71.3 ± 24.8 μg/m3) and Ya'an (72.6 ± 27.1 μg/m3) were similar. However, the chemical compositions of PM2.5 showed significant differences. Chengdu exhibited higher concentrations of water-soluble inorganic ions, whereas Ya'an had higher levels of carbonaceous compounds. Both cities experienced an ammonium-rich environment, which promoted the homogeneous generation of secondary pollutants. Moreover, as PM2.5 pollution worsened, the influence of heterogeneous reactions involving SO2 and NOx, as well as the heterogeneous hydrolysis of N2O5, gradually became more pronounced in particle formation. Additionally, adverse meteorological conditions facilitated pollutant accumulation in Ya'an. Using the Positive Matrix Factorization model, we identified 5 sources of PM2.5. The primary source of PM2.5 in both cities was secondary formation (35.4% in Chengdu and 32.5% in Ya'an), while their second-largest contributors varied (26.2% from vehicle emission in Chengdu, and 26.6% from combustion source in Ya'an). These discrepancies highlight the necessity for tailored government interventions, particularly during the winter season. By analyzing the light absorption of the carbonaceous at 370 nm, we discovered that brown carbon was the primary absorber of near-ultraviolet light, with vehicle emissions accounting for the largest portion in Chengdu (37.2%) and combustion emissions being the predominant factor in Ya'an (51.0%).

This study aims to investigate the economic and environmental impacts of optimizing feed configurations of dairy farms in Inner Mongolia (China), using data from farm surveys, life cycle assessments and linear optimization programming. The findings of our study reveal that feed optimization may lower carbon footprints by 36–44%, nitrogen footprints by 35–42%, and phosphorus footprints by 42–71%, compared to the baseline.

A multiscale techno-economic analysis is performed to determine first the raw material yield to pellets as well as estimating CAPEX and OPEX as a function of the biomass processed. Next, the location of the facilities is evaluated in the agricultural counties of Castilla y León through the formulation of an MILP facility location problem, including economic, social, and environmental objectives. The lignocellulosic materials considered are pinewood, eucalyptus wood, corn stover, and switchgrass. For substituting the natural gas-powered boilers in towns with over 500 inhabitants, 860,000 t/yr of pellets will be necessary. 98.1% substitution is achieved deploying 13 pellet plants, 11 based on pinewood and 2 on corn stover, representing 26.4% of the resources available and it is necessary to invest 164.8 M€ with an annual profitability of 133.0 M€. The emissions substituting these boilers are reduced by 94.8%. Switchgrass is studied separately as it is not currently grown in Castilla y León, although, its introduction would decrease the OPEX from 127.5 €/t to 63.9 €/t while the social and environmental impact is adversely affected.";"2024-07-05";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624021115";"2";"Emissions Other"

Simulation analysis is carried out to explore the effects of different parameters on the cooperative transformation of enterprises under different governmental strategies. The results show that there is a mutual assistance mechanism between RPS and industrial green development, and the key lies in whether IGP and PGG can form a cooperative mechanism, while the government's incentives and disincentives mechanism is the key to promote the formation of cooperative mechanisms between the two parties. If the government adopts punitive measures, it should take into account the transformation costs of IGP and the scale of PGG, and if it adopts subsidy measures, it should give priority to helping enterprises with lower transformation costs, otherwise it will face greater financial pressure. The compatibility of IGP and PGG is the key to determining whether the two sides can realize the transformation.

Experimental evidence from China ";" The implementation of new-type infrastructure plays a crucial role in driving low-carbon economic development in China and worldwide. This work employs fixed-effects model, mediated-effects model, spatial Durbin model, and meta-analysis to thoroughly examine the influence of new-type infrastructure on total factor carbon productivity using panel data of 274 Chinese cities spanning from 2011 to 2021. The findings indicate that: firstly, new-type infrastructure has a notable and beneficial impact on total factor carbon productivity, but there is heterogeneity in resource endowment, city scale, and policy intensity. New-type infrastructure can only promote total factor carbon productivity enhancement in non-resource cities and large cities. Under the influence of smart city policies, new-type infrastructure has a stronger effect on total factor carbon productivity enhancement. Secondly, digital finance and marketization are important ways for new-type infrastructure to improve total factor carbon productivity. Thirdly, via spatial spillover effect, new-type infrastructure may boost total factor carbon productivity not only in the local region but also in places that are spatially connected. Accordingly, this paper offers policy recommendations for the government to encourage the investment and development of new-type infrastructure to support total factor carbon productivity growth.

However, there are fewer temporal analyses of cities' carbon footprints from a multi-infrastructure perspective. This study applied the community-wide trans-boundary infrastructure-based carbon footprinting (CIF) method to Shanghai, China and adopted the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) approach to explore driving factors in community-wide carbon footprints from 2000 to 2019. Shanghai's total CIF increased by 85%, from 153.2 million tonne CO2-eq in 2000 to 283.5 million tonne in 2019. The energy and mobility sectors contributed to 89%–93% of the total CIF during this period. Although emitting sources within Shanghai contributed to a large proportion, trans-boundary carbon emissions embodied in imported energy, construction materials, and food provisioning increased from 6% of total CIF in 2000 to 28% in 2019. Shanghai significantly reduced city-wide carbon intensity per GDP from 2000 to 2019. Its city-wide carbon footprint per capita was around 11.4 tonne CO2-eq, of which 17.4% was associated with residential consumption. LMDI results showed that improving energy efficiency in economic production and reducing energy demand in residential sector contributed to reducing carbon footprints of these two sectors. The driving effect of carbon intensity was not monotonic in both economic production and residential consumption, indicating future policy should prioritize actions to reduce the carbon intensity of infrastructure provisioning in its carbon neutrality plan.

This study investigated the viability of utilizing isocyanate-nanoclay composites as modifiers for eco-friendly modified asphalt. The composite modified asphalt samples were prepared by adding isocyanate (isophorone diisocyanate, IPDI) and nanoclay (organic montmorillonite, OMMT or attapulgite, ATT) to the base asphalt at varying contents. A device for generating and collecting asphalt fumes was developed. The impact of modifier dosage on fume emission reduction was assessed quantitatively and qualitatively using ultraviolet–visible spectrophotometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, yielding the optimal ratio of composite modifiers. The fume emission reduction mechanism of the modifiers was elucidated by analyzing changes in distribution, functional group composition and micromolecular spacing of asphalt using fluorescence microscopy, fourier-transform infrared reflection, and X-ray diffraction. Results revealed that the intercalation effect between nanoclay and asphalt, combined with chemical reactions between isocyanates and functional groups of nanoclay/asphalt components, effectively impeded the escape of fume molecules. Modified asphalt with 3% ATT+3% IPDI achieved an impressive fume emission reduction rate of 44.67% and enhanced basic performance of base asphalt.

It also signified the meticulous role of recycled flue gas in altering the combustion behaviour in the combustor. Accordingly, investigation into different recirculation modes focusing on recycle ratio, wet/dry conditions, and excess oxygen ratio are conducted with an indirect supercritical power cycle integrated biomass oxy-fuel combustion system. Energy and exergy analyses, as well as composition of flue gas produced are presented. Energy and exergy efficiencies increased with reducing recycle ratio, with respective highest efficiency of 31.33% and 44.37% obtained at excess oxygen ratio of 1.01 and recycle ratio of 0.5 under wet condition. Investigation of CO2 and H2O concentration in produced flue gas depicted a separated stage profile under dry recycle condition, different from the slight diverging profile observed under wet condition when the recycle ratio varied. Concentration of NOx and SOx increased with decreasing recycle ratio and are generally higher under dry condition. Selective exergy analyses of the proposed power cycle presented highest exergy loss in the combustor, followed by the air separation unit, heat exchanger, CO2 compression and purification unit, and turbine generator. Based on the obtained result, wet recycle flue gas enhanced the combustion performance in the combustor but slightly impaired the convective heat transfer in the heat exchanger. The performance of proposed biomass power cycle is optimized at low recycle ratio of 0.5 under wet recycle condition.

However, the complex formation process and strong time-dependence of PAHs in the Arctic increase the difficulty of prediction. Herein, deep learning (DL) models were developed to predict monthly air concentrations of 16 priority PAHs at Alert monitoring station by incorporating the inherent periodicity of PAH concentrations and ancillary data including PAH emissions, meteorological information, fire emissions, and sea ice area. The prediction performance of long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU) and bidirectional LSTM (Bi LSTM) algorithms were compared by multiple model evaluation metrics. The results showed that Bi LSTM models outperformed LSTM and GRU in predicting PAHs concentrations because it exhibited higher accuracy in terms of average R 2 ext (0.09) and errors (average MAPE ext = 1.45). The DL interpretation based on SHAP values suggested that the main drivers of PAHs concentrations were PAHs emissions and sea ice area, with a more prominent contribution from meteorological conditions.

However, green hydrogen remains a costly and scarce commodity. Besides conventional hydrogen production in centralized large-scale chemical factories, so-called green technologies like electrolysis and bio-based hydrogen production enable rather decentralized hydrogen hubs. Such hubs obviate cost-intensive transportation by regionally interlinking supply and demand. Purposeful deployment of confined resources for establishing such infrastructure for green hydrogen production is necessary to achieve greenhouse gas-emission reduction on a long-term system level. For doing so, detailed data concerning geospatial and temporal occurring industrial hydrogen demands is essential. This article provides structural basics of a transferable procedure model for determining such data within variable system boundaries. Therefore, 44 current and potential future industrial hydrogen applications are identified and associated with calculation principles for quantifying location-based demands. The elaboration of a scenario approach based on location-specific influencing factors enables the consideration of regional characteristics and the consequential varying implementation rate of hydrogen technologies.

However, the potential consequences of regional trade on carbon storage associated with construction land remain largely unquantified. Therefore, this study zeroes in on Guangdong Province as the focal point, employing China's multiregional input-output model to quantify interregional teleconnections and delineate changes in carbon storage. Through meticulous analysis, it seeks to pinpoint the catalysts driving these alterations in teleconnections. By delving into the latest teleconnections within Guangdong, the study unveils the ramifications of the province's trade scale and structure with other provinces on carbon storage, thereby identifying imperative avenues for carbon storage preservation. The findings underscore that during the study period, the expansion of construction land in Guangdong Province precipitated a notable loss of land carbon storage, amounting to 2.6 Tg C, primarily sourced from forests and arable land. Concurrently, the total carbon flow surged by 20.77 Tg C, propelled by a 4.63 Tg C influx and a 16.05 Tg C outflow, resulting in a net inflow decrease of 11.51 Tg C. This delineates the influence of external forces on carbon storage within Guangdong Province, with the surge primarily attributed to heightened external demand, notably for construction land. Nevertheless, technological advancements have partially alleviated the impact of this demand surge on carbon storage. The outcomes of this study underscore the pivotal role of external linkages in shaping carbon storage dynamics and furnish invaluable insights for steering future regional endeavors towards carbon neutrality objectives.

The “height to architectural top” category, which includes decorative spires, is used to define the influential CTBUH annual rankings of the “World's Tallest Buildings”. The inclusion of decorative spires in the category ranking has created an incentive for developers to maximise the vanity height of tall buildings, defined as the height difference between a tall building's architectural top and its highest occupied floor. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the detrimental influence of spires and, by extension, vanity height on the embodied carbon of structural systems for tall buildings. This influence is evaluated using three tall building scenarios of varying heights (50, 70, and 90 storeys). Two finite element models, with and without spires, are parametrically designed for each scenario. All the modelled structural systems comprise a reinforced concrete tube-in-tube lateral load resisting system. A hybrid life cycle inventory analysis approach is used to quantify the embodied carbon of spires as well as the resulting increase in the embodied carbon of structural systems. The findings of this study indicate that even basic spires can lead to an increase of up to 14.2% in the embodied carbon of structural systems for tall buildings, underscoring the imperative to eliminate such elements in the design and construction of tall buildings to minimise overall embodied carbon.";"2024-06-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624017827";"2";"Emissions Other"

While the Netherlands imported only approximately 15% of its natural gas from Russia, it was among the European countries actively seeking alternative solutions as a political gesture, while simultaneously exploring new energy sources and energy-saving methods. Alongside financial relief, the Dutch government's focus shifted toward reducing energy consumption through behavioural changes, as illustrated by the launch of the national ""Zet ook de knop om"" (""Flip the Switch"") campaign. This campaign encouraged citizens to reduce their indoor temperature to 19°C and suggested alternative measures to maintain thermal comfort while lowering residential energy consumption and costs. Crucially, the national campaign sought to motivate and inspire in a time of crisis motivational aspects with no attention to challenges, such as habits or inappropriate and inexpedient infrastructures. This paper uses a living lab approach to demonstrate that behavioural changes are possible when routinized practices are disrupted through predefined challenges. The living labs were conducted in late 2018, with two follow-up surveys administered three months and three years after the end of the active implementation period. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected before, during, and after the challenges.

The results indicate that COVID–19 occurrence and related response measures did not contribute to significant environment benefits in terms of Global Warming Potential (GWP) and other pollutants in short term and long term. This implies that although immediate reductions in emissions were observed in many studies, the long term effects were minimal due to irregular policies and unmanaged demand. Further, to achieve environment benefits sustained measures should be implemented in long term with proper planning and supporting infrastructure.

In this study, an effective heterogeneous catalyst, acid-base bifunctional mesoporous ZnF2 (MP-ZnF2) was successfully fabricated for biodiesel synthesis from Koelreuteria integrifoliola oil (KIO, acid values of 8.26 mg KOH/g) via facile one-pot process. Meanwhile, systematic characterization showed the large specific surface area (62.9 m2/g), abundant mesoporous (12.15 nm), outstanding thermal stability, and plentiful stable acid-base sites (1.22 and 0.56 mmol/g) of MP-ZnF2. Consequently, MP-ZnF2 achieved a high biodiesel yield of 97.15% under moderate conditions (103 °C, 6.2 h, 10.2 wt% catalyst dosages, 29:1 MeOH/KIO molar ratio) optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). More importantly, through the kinetic investigation, a low activation energy of 49.24 kJ/mol explained the reason for its high activity, and the possible reaction mechanism of (trans)esterification was also proposed. In addition, MP-ZnF2 demonstrated satisfactory reusability (6th cycle, >90%), water resistance (8 wt% water content, 89.25%), and versatility (all yields >90%). According to cost analysis, the price of biodiesel in this work was about 0.64 $/kg.

One effective strategy to enhance efficiency is optimising energy system operations within industries. The initial step in establishing operational optimisation involves developing a comprehensive model of the energy system. This model necessitates a specific structure to meet optimisation requirements. However, creating a model from scratch incurs substantial effort. While numerous companies possess energy models, they often lack the requisite structure for optimisation. Consequently, simplifying existing models can significantly reduce the effort needed to implement operational optimisation. This paper investigates the simplification of intricate industrial energy system models for optimisation purposes. The subsequent sections analyse two distinct approaches. One approach involves linearisation, while the other utilises neural networks. To facilitate a comparative analysis of these approaches, a reference model is developed. The assessment of these methodologies includes an investigation into optimisation robustness, computation time, accuracy concerning the reference model, and the effort required for developing and maintaining the simplified models. It proved that both approaches are suitable for operational optimisation. Linearisation exhibits superior computational efficiency compared to the neural network approach. The linearisation modelling approach together with the optimisation only required a few milliseconds for the calculation. The neural network approach needed 3 h for the calculation of the optimum with the genetic algorithm. The simulation of the neural network itself only required a few milliseconds. Hence, an improvement of the genetic algorithm is needed. However, the accuracy of linearisation falls short of that achieved by neural networks. The linearisation achieves a mean average percentage error from only 13%. In comparison the neural network's mean average error is 2.3%. Therefore, the linearisation must be improved.

Consequently, new technologies of ICEs are continually emerging to enhance competitiveness in reducing environmental impacts. However, the limited studies on the life cycle assessment (LCA) of ICEs make it difficult to evaluate the actual contributions of the emerging technologies from a life cycle perspective. Conducting a systematic review of ICEs LCA studies could identify weaknesses and gaps in these studies for new scenarios. Therefore, this article presents the first systematic review of the LCA of ICEs to provide an overview of the current state of knowledge. A total of 87 life cycle assessment studies between 2017 and 2023 using the Scopus database were identified after searching for the keywords ""Sustainability assessment"" OR ""Life cycle assessment"" AND ""Internal combustion engine*"" OR ""ICE*"" and carefully screening, and then classified and analyzed by six aspects including sustainability indicators, life cycle phases, life cycle inventories, ICE technologies (including alternative fuels), types of mobile sources and powertrain systems. It is concluded that there are quite limited studies solely focusing on LCA of ICEs, and the LCA assessment lacks consideration of: 1. environmental pollution, human health and socio-economic aspects, 2. fuel production process and maintenance & repair phase, 3. small and developing countries, 4. the emerging ICE technologies and zero carbon/carbon-neutral fuels, 5. large and high-power mobile sources and heavy-duty hybrid technologies.";"2024-04-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624014446";"25";"Emissions Other"

With its characteristics of high efficiency, high productivity, and low emissions, it plays a significant role in the low-carbon transition of the energy market (EM). This study scientifically evaluates the integration level between urban digital economy and energy market (DEI) using panel data from 281 Chinese cities between 2011 and 2020. The Dagum Gini coefficient, variance decomposition, and QAP methods are employed to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution characteristics and reveal the sources and formation mechanism of integration differences. The findings are as follows: ①The integration level between China's urban digital economy and energy market exhibits an apparent upward trend, but significant differences exist among the four major regions. ②Inter-regional disparities serve as the primary spatial source of the integration differences between China's urban digital economy and energy market. ③The difference in integration efficiency is the primary structural source of the integration differences, with the western and northeastern regions experiencing the greatest impact. ④The four structural-layer factors, namely integration efficiency, integration foundation, integration structure, and integration scale, contribute positively to integration differences, with the effect intensity decreasing in sequence. Accordingly, several policy implications derive. These include implementing targeted measures to address inter-regional disparities and promote balanced integration across different region, efforts to enhance integration efficiency in underperforming regions, and prioritizing investment in infrastructure to enhance the overall integration level. In conclusion, this study provides valuable insights into the integrated development between China's urban DE and EM, offering guidance for countries seeking to optimize DE and EM.

Following the 2018 European directive RED II, these projects have rapidly increased across the continent, showcasing their potential for creating sustainable local energy systems. While studies highlight economic, environmental, and social benefits, barriers such as regulatory challenges, finance access, and low public awareness remain. This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review that explores the state-of-the-art of the academic research on energy communities. The study adopts a systematic approach to examine the body of literature on the topic to provide a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon on the basis of rigorous and replicable research criteria. The reviewed material consists of 140 articles collected through the Scopus database, evaluated using specific structural dimensions to group the literature into analytical categories. The analysis of scientific papers published between 2018 and 2022 shows a growing attention towards Renewable Energy Communities, particularly those based on solar energy for electricity production, often combined with storage systems and heat pumps, whereas attention towards energy communities based on thermal energy production is still limited. Furthermore, most scholars focused on analysing specific territorial contexts; comparisons between different regions allows to highlight common features and elements characterizing each model. It emerged that the development of energy communities depends mainly on regulatory, financial, and managerial barriers that require an adequate institutional and legal framework capable of promoting their diffusion. Most studies address the topic from an economic perspective, often in association with incentivizing community models. However, a social perspective should be included by introducing the concept of energy sharing and methodologies for its distribution among all members of the community. The scientific community is called upon to continue investigating and supporting the development of community energy initiatives by providing evidence-based recommendations to policymakers, industry stakeholders, and local communities. This can help to overcome existing barriers and facilitate the diffusion of energy communities models, contributing to the achievement of sustainable and inclusive energy transition goals.

It is widely acknowledged in the literature that designs based on conventional pathways relying solely on historical weather data disregard the effects of the changing climate and lose their intended energy performance over time. Several endeavors have been made to generate weather files capable of capturing the essence of the changing climate and carrying its variability. In line with these efforts, the synthesized weather files have emerged as a promising alternative to the commonly used morphing method for incorporating climate change variability into building energy designs. However, a comprehensive framework with a potential to accommodate this variability in this context is yet to be investigated. Addressing this gap, the present study aims to propose a novel framework that can facilitate dynamic design upgrades in response to the changing climate including the extreme climate conditions. This framework has been applied to a case study building in Australia and around 31% annual thermal load reduction, on average, has been achieved. Furthermore, the results showed that conventional design pathways are likely to leave buildings inadequately prepared against the upcoming climate conditions. Therefore, the proposed framework is capable of generating a dynamic design that not only maintains the expected energy performance by incorporating the changing climate into its structure but also draws a more realistic picture of the building energy demand pattern over time.";"2024-04-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624011958";"3";"Emissions Other"

The local government encourages manufacturers to adopt low-carbon technology for better realizing carbon neutrality and sustainable achievement by environmental regulations. However, it is not enough to only rely on governmental regulation. The supervision of the media on LCT adoption is also indispensable. Therefore, the multi-participants’ supervision strategy on LCT is proposed to fill the gap, consisting of the government, manufacturer, and media. To help manufacturers perform low-carbon production, an evolutionary game model is formulated to investigate the strategic behaviors of involved tripartite participants. We disclose the evolution process of the manufacturer's LCT adoption decision under joint supervision-the government and media. Besides, the detailed influences of parameters such as the cost of LCT and carbon emission ratio on participants' strategies are explored to help better understand the involved participants' behaviors. The numerical results show that the manufacturer is more likely to adopt LCT under joint supervision. When the manufacturer could gain more benefits by adopting LCT, they would always choose to employ LCT even if there is no stimulus from the government and media. The information lied factor would reduce the degree of governmental supervision, which is not conducive to performing regulation responsibility for the government. This study examines the strategic supervision behaviors of multiple participants by formulating an evolutionary game model while giving support to decision-making management on LCT promotion for manufacturers.

Assimilation of new transport technologies with traditional design-bid-build decision-making paradigm should acknowledge sustainability triple-bottom-line social, cost, and environmental impacts, across all lifecycle stages for a system-wide optimisation. This study presents a multilevel framework to evaluate road transport system projects utilising 1) stakeholder engagement for flexibility in establishing key performance indicators, 2) passenger surveys to identify what encourages mode choice towards public transport, 3) microsimulation models, lifecycle cost and lifecycle analysis for quantitative assessment, 4) analytic hierarchy for qualitative assessment, and finally 5) multi-criteria modelling with stakeholder expert group preferences. Framework is applied to a 5-lane dual carriageway project in Abu Dhabi, analysing eight virgin and recycled material-based and public transport service alternatives. Study revealed the significance of saved user time, reduced fuel consumption during use phase and vehicle operational costs as the highest lifecycle impact generators. The total sustainability performance across the lifecycle for all alternatives was affected by traffic gridlock formation due to traffic growth in later years and lack of traffic load reduction strategies. Results showed that an autonomous vehicle-based bus rapid transit service coupled with recycled material to construct the road significantly reduced lifecycle cost (51.1%), energy (55.6%) and pollutant (54.5%-CO2, 49.7%-NOx, 24.1%-PM) burdens. It exhibited effectiveness of system choice using lifecycle assessment over the typically fragmented project planning and evaluation approach.

Also, can the adverse economic effects of such subsidy removal be mitigated through government transfer payments to the firms and households? Taking the 2020 subsidy reform in Nigeria as a case, this study introduces the African Energy and Environment Integrated Computable General Equilibrium (AEEICGE) model, version 2.0., to examine the economic and environmental impacts of fossil fuel subsidy removal. The AEEICGE V.2.0. model accounts for the substitutability of intermediate input demand for energy products. The results show that although subsidy removal on fossil fuels improves environmental quality, such reform negatively affects the economic well-being of the economic agents and raises overall prices. These adverse impacts are reversed when the subsidy is reallocated differently to businesses and households through the government's transfer payments nonetheless. Particularly, the subsidy removal makes a 0.25 bps contribution to aggregate inflation and leads to welfare losses of about ₦0.049 billion and ₦0.108 billion, on average, for the poor and rich Nigerian households respectively. Notwithstanding, their welfare improves and gains, on average, about ₦15.89 billion and ₦78.96 billion respectively with the proposed resource reallocation schemes.

Ammonia on-line cracking to produce hydrogen production has the potential to realize the high-efficiency combustion. A new ammonia/methanol/hydrogen mechanism was updated and simplified using several reduction methods to optimize the computation time in 3D simulation. Visualization measurements in constant volume combustion chamber (CVCC) for flame propagation and NO generation were conducted, and 3D computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling was also established with the simplified mechanism simultaneously to investigate the impact of methanol addition and ammonia cracking in the lean-burn mode. The findings showed that methanol addition and ammonia cracking can significantly improve the combustion rate, and 60%ammonia/40%methanol with ammonia cracking ratio of 90% (N60R90) at equivalence ratio (ER) of 0.7 yields the similar LBV as pure methanol at ER of 1.0 in laminar burning condition. Its ER can be extended to 0.4 to obtain the similar level of LBV as pure ammonia at 1.0. The experiments and 3D simulations revealed that N60R90 at 0.4 yields the equivalent level of combustion rate as N60R0 at 0.8, while obtaining much lower NO emission. In addition, N60R100 at 0.4 without fuel-NO formation during the combustion can get ultra-low NO emission.

This study uses publicly available administrative data spanning nearly 30 years at the provincial level to characterize the “business as usual” (BAU) energy transition in China's rural household sector in order to inform interventions needed to achieve clean energy goals. We first describe the temporal trends and spatial characteristics of energy transitions over the past three decades. We then use a simple two-way fixed effects model to estimate the role that household income growth plays in this transition process. Finally, we predict the timeline for the BAU rural energy transition with an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model. Our results show that China's rural household sector has gradually undergone a consistent but geographically uneven transition over the past three decades. Compared with warmer provinces without indoor heating, where a 1000 RMB increase in per capita income is associated with a 5–10% increase in the share of clean energy, in provinces with heating needs the predicted effect is less than 2%. ARIMA model projections suggest that without policy interventions, for most provinces in northern China the share of clean energy would remain less than 40% by the year 2050. The “clean heating program” implemented in the North China Plain in 2015 has therefore advanced the energy transition by 10 years in just the 3 years between 2015 and 2018. Together, these results show the potential for interventions in helping spur energy transitions.

However, existing empirical evidence does not suggest a clear link between climate aid and carbon lock-in. Based on country-level panel data from 77 countries spanning the period 2002–2020, this paper empirically examines the impact of climate aid on carbon lock-in and the four sub-indicators of carbon lock-in. Moreover, we investigate the mediating role of technological progress and potential impact mechanisms. We find that (1) climate aid has a significant restraining effect on carbon lock-in, and is an effective means of inhibiting the four aspects of carbon lock-in, namely, the lock-in of industry, institution, technology, and social behavior. (2) Technological progress not only directly leads to carbon lock-in eradication, but also synergizes with climate aid, suggesting that the combined influence of technological progress and climate aid can enhance the efficacy of efforts to mitigate carbon lock-in. (3) Climate aid promotes carbon lock-in mitigation by accelerating energy structure transition and industrial structure transition, which are two internal impact mechanisms in the nexus between climate aid and carbon lock-in. These findings offer concrete and practical policy implications to facilitate the development of climate aid and carbon lock-in eradication.

However, securing public support for such policies is a complex endeavor. The pivotal role of policy narratives in molding public perceptions and garnering support underscores the necessity for a strategic approach in the crafting and deployment of these narratives to strengthen public endorsement of nudge-based decarbonization strategies.

It will be an important business for electricity retailers to aggregate these distributed renewable resources and make use of their carbon emission reduction benefits. Therefore, this paper proposes a business model for electricity retailers based on electricity-carbon coupling retail packages. Firstly, a framework of the business model is proposed to support distributed renewable energy transaction among the electricity retailer, prosumers, and consumers. Secondly, dynamic carbon evaluation mechanism-based electricity-carbon coupling retail packages are designed, which contain three types of generation packages for prosumers (e.g., fixed subsidy package, dynamic subsidy package and daytime generation package) and three types of consumption packages for consumers (e.g., daytime consumption package, nighttime consumption package and minimum consumption package). In addition, a single-leader and multi-followers Stackelberg game model is constructed to optimize the designed packages. Especially, the electricity retailer aims at maximizing its profit considering conditional value at risk (CVaR) as the leader. Meanwhile, prosumers and consumers respectively aim at maximizing their profit satisfaction and comprehensive satisfaction as followers. Finally, the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and CPLEX commercial solver are both used to obtain the model's Nash equilibrium (NE).

In this study, the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument on the Sentinel-5P satellite was adopted to investigate the coverage of atmospheric CH4 concentrations over the Zhoushan archipelago, which is China's largest OGST base. Specifically, the distribution of atmospheric CH4 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations over Zhoushan in August 2022 and August 2023 were evaluated, where changes in concentrations around the OGST companies were monitored. Using surface temperature inversion and average temperature statistics, we analyzed the heat island effect in Zhoushan. The results showed that: (1) although there is limited valid data (>200 pixel/day) for Zhoushan, the amount of valid data increased from 3.2% in January 2020 to 32.3% in August 2023; (2) around the region of the OGST companies, the atmospheric CH4 concentration shown significant variation at both the spatial and temporal scales, which may be due to the storage, loading, and unloading of petroleum products; (3) under geographic isolation conditions, NO2 can be used as a tracer gas to track the CH4 emissions from OGST companies; and (4) Surface temperature analysis underscores OGST companies' contribution to Zhoushan's urban heat island effect, with local average temperature increases outstripping broader national trends, highlighting the intricate interplay of human and natural factors in the city-scale climate dynamics.

";" In the context of China's pursuit of an ecological civilization, controlling haze pollution (HP) and enhancing environmental quality occupy a pivotal role. Addressing this issue, this study utilizes a dataset spanning from 2006 to 2020, encompassing 278 Chinese cities, to examine the impact and mechanisms of sustainable finance on HP management. This research innovatively constructs a Sustainable Finance Index and employs fixed effects models, mediation effect models, and spatial Durbin models for comprehensive empirical analysis. The findings indicate a significant negative relationship between sustainable finance and HP, with pronounced effects in cities experiencing severe haze, cities in the central and eastern regions of China, and non-provincial boundary cities. Mechanism analysis reveals that sustainable finance curtails urban haze formation through the optimization of energy consumption structure, enhancement of energy efficiency, and advancement of environmental technologies. This is primarily achieved through pollution source reduction and innovation effects. Additionally, the study uncovers a spatial spillover effect of sustainable finance in mitigating HP, peaking within a 500-km radius. This research not only provides new insights into the role of sustainable finance in the construction of ecological civilization but also offers empirical support for policymakers and stakeholders in formulating clean production policies, enhancing both the academic dialogue and practical policymaking in environmental management and sustainable development.

However, China's continuing heavy reliance on fossil fuels, especially coal, masks the complex positive trends in energy use, more sustainable economic development, and environmental management. Through examining the evolving energy-GDP relationships in China over the past few decades, we elucidated the underlying complex nonlinear processes using environmental Kuznets curve analysis and showed that the energy–GDP relationship has fluctuated between positive and negative decoupling. Furthermore, fluctuating trajectories manifested as sharp regional divergences when early-transitioning coastal areas restructured toward services and exhibited robust decoupling, whereas the industrial interior remained fossil fuel reliant. We identified various forces related to these provincial disparities, where rapid urbanization, industrial realignment, and income growth were all important. By promoting service transitions and enabling low-carbon technologies in coastal hubs, these drivers also exposed infrastructure deficits and entrenched fossil fuel usage in the interior. These problems led to China's latest strategic plans emphasizing “higher quality” growth underpinned by clean energy transitions and coordinated regional policies. Ongoing declines in coal and the rise in renewable energy usage highlight promising momentum, but stable decoupling remains contingent on sustained policy coordination. The intricate balance between growth and environmental pressures in China provides essential lessons to help emerging economies achieve sustainability by catalyzing green transitions and attaining developmental milestones.

Changes in hourly traffic densities and pollutant emissions after the opening of trams are investigated in this study based on temporal and spatial microdata. Additionally, the effects of different factors influencing these changes are analyzed. Our analysis confirms that tram operation can generate transportation substitution effects as well as, potentially, transportation creation effects. Trams create additional traffic demand in more congested areas while providing a substitution mode of transportation in less congested areas. The main factors influencing these changes are land use, transport transfer, and population size.

Nevertheless, accurate determination of the pollution sources and distribution of PM2.5 concentrations is especially important for source apportionment and mitigation strategies. This study provides estimates of PM2.5 concentrations across Malaysia in high spatial resolution, based on multi-satellite data and machine learning (ML) models, namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Regression (SVR) and extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), also covering remote areas without measurement networks. The study aims to develop ML models that are simpler than previous works and demonstrate computational efficiency. Six sub-models were developed to represent different locations and seasons in Malaysia. Model 1 includes all data from 65 air-quality stations, Models 2 and 3 characterize urban/industrial and suburban sites, respectively, while Models 4 to 6 correspond to dry, wet, and inter-monsoon seasons, respectively. The RF technique exhibited slightly better performance compared to the XGBoost and SVR approaches. More specifically, for model 1, it exhibited a high correlation with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.64 and RMSE of 12.17 μg m−3, while similar results were obtained for models 3, model 4 and model 5. The lower performance (R2 = 0.16–0.94) observed in the wet and inter-monsoon seasons is due to fewer number of data used in model calibration. Integration of two AOD products from the Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) sensors together with gases pollutants from Sentinel 5P enabled seamless seasonal PM2.5 mapping over Malaysia, even for a short period of time. However, usage of data with insufficient information during the model training procedure, and lack of satellite data due to cloud contamination, can limit the PM2.5 prediction accuracy.

This study presents a prediction method for biomass energy supply-demand and changes in supply-demand patterns that connects the past and future. In the study, carbon peaking and carbon neutrality are taken as the time base. The FLUS model is used to simulate future land allocation in four basic scenarios: natural development scenario, agricultural development scenario, low-carbon development scenario and industrial development scenario; and townships, towns, and subdistricts are taken as the basic statistical unit. Based on this, we have examined the suitability of future development of biomass energy in rural and urban areas in each scenario, as well as its contribution to the future energy system transformation that substitutes for fossil energy. This method has been applied to the case study of townships, towns, and subdistricts in Harbin City in China. The study results show that: The degrees to which biomass energy potential can substitute for fossil energy in the four scenarios in 2030 reach 4.21%, 5.62%, 5.47%, and 3.82%, respectively. Under agricultural development scenario, the supply-demand balance areas account for 48.94%, meaning this scenario has the largest potential for energy development and transition; low-carbon development scenario sees the highest degree of spatial supply-demand match, and thus enjoys the most advantages in energy transportation. The degrees to which biomass energy potential can substitute for fossil energy under the four scenarios in 2060 reach 2.01%, 6.96%, 5.35%, and 1.26% respectively. Agricultural development scenario still has the largest development potential, with the proportion of supply-demand balance areas jumping to 50.46%; Finally, low supply-high demand mismatch clusters are mainly concentrated in the main urban area and the central areas of townships, towns, and subdistricts. The high supply-low demand mismatch clusters are mainly distributed in the northeast. Under low-carbon development scenario, the low supply-high demand mismatch ratio has been reduced to 0.92%, the lowest supply-demand mismatch among all scenarios. Therefore, low-carbon development scenario enjoys the most spatial match advantages. This study will serve as an assessment method to advance the spatial development of biomass, and provide a geospatial basis for optimizing the layout of future energy development. Compared with previous studies, it has more spatial attributes, better reflects the complexity of biomass energy changes and is more connected with the measurement results and future policy making. In future research, we will combine multiple types of clean energy into the comparison and combined use to form a more comprehensive and specific research framework for new energy conversion.

Then, we used the Geographical Weighted Regression model to quantify the relationship between carbon sink of cropland and influencing factors at the national, agricultural zone and provincial scales. Finally, we discussed potential ways to enhance carbon sink of cropland. The results found that the total carbon sink of cropland in 2020 was in surplus, with 2.56 billion tons, showing a spatial distribution of “high north and low south”.

While crop yields and quality depend on the type and amount of chemical fertiliser supplied, there are limitations to fertiliser use, as continuous application of inorganic fertilisers can negatively affect soil fertility and result in mineral leaching. Organic fertiliser produced by Anaerobic Digestion (AD) of sewage waste (AD digestate) has been proposed as a substitute for chemical fertilisers. To investigate the potential for the use of AD digestate in pasture systems, grassland field trials were conducted on three independent farm enterprises in Ireland. AD digestate and chemical fertilisers were applied separately or in various combinations and the effects on soil mineral content, grass yield and quality compared. The analyses revealed significant improvement of soil nitrification activity along with improved fodder yield and quality. In particular, digestate application increased crude protein content of fodder by up to 22.8 % compared to fodder from plots without digestate application, that had up to 14.8% crude protein. The increase could be attributed to the white clover percentage increase from 2% (no AD digestate) to up to 31% on plots where AD digestate was applied. Strikingly, grass yields were 1.5-2-fold higher than the five-year national average (of 59.7 ± 4 kg DM/ha/day) on the plots where AD digestate was applied, either alone or in combination with chemical fertilisers.

With a high calcium oxide content of 37–77% and notably high alkalinity, CKD undergoes intricate carbonation reactions, resulting in the formation of stable carbonates. The overview delves into various carbonation pathways, providing a robust framework for assessing CO2 uptake in CKD. Metrics such as carbonation rate and degree prove crucial in quantifying CO2 uptake, with moisture availability emerging as a pivotal factor. The reported carbonation rate ranges from a CO2 uptake of 1.5%–27% by mass of dry CKD. Carbonation degrees above 60% have been widely reported, while some researchers reportedly achieved higher degrees, including full attainment of theoretical CO2 uptake. Beyond environmental impact reduction, carbonated CKD shows promise in construction materials and toxic component immobilization. Research priorities were identified, emphasizing scalable carbonation techniques and diverse applications for carbonated CKD.

The Chinese Bohai Sea performs generally as a weak carbon source while carbon fluxes (fCO2), pH, and aragonite saturation states (Ωarag) vary in time and space under intensive land-sea interaction. However, there are still 1) insufficient spatiotemporal resolution in existing remotely sensed retrieval of carbon flux, 2) inadequate analytic mechanism for existing empirical models, which are not suitable for case II waters in Bohai Sea, and 3) limited research on remotely sensed retrieval of acidification risk expressed as pH and Ωarag. Thus, we proposed a semi-analytical mechanism algorithm (MeSAA) to gain seawater partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2 sw) with hour-level GOCI imagery and seawater carbonate equilibrium equation (CO2SYS). With the assistance of ERA5 reanalysis data, the gained pCO2 sw was then used to obtain fCO2 by using the sea-air CO2 partial pressure difference (ΔpCO2) method. Similarly, with the assistance of remotely sensed retrieval, two indices, pH and Ωarag were also gained from CO2SYS to identify the acidification risk. The results showed that Bohai Sea was a weak carbon source with the positive values of fCO2 (0.5–6 mmol C·m−2·day−1) and total emission (0.956 Tg C·yr−1). It suffered from a high acidification risk, especially in three bays with low values of Ωarag (1.15–1.3) from May to September 2011. Although photosynthetic carbon sequestration was intensive near shore, it could not consume the large amount of the rich carbon input, and resulting a monthly increase for pCO2 sw and fCO2 and a monthly decrease for pH and Ωarag from May to September.

We propose a command-controlled DEA model and an energy quota trading DEA model through non-parametric linear programming based on two policy strategies of energy consumption control. We then assess total factor productivity and its growth sources for 35 two-digit industrial sector in China, as well as examine economic potential and optimal path forecasts for carbon peaking. The results show that total factor productivity and economic potential for energy quota trading are higher than those for command-controlled energy policy. Energy-saving effect can be achieved for energy quota trading because the total energy input is lower. Additionally, the sources of productivity growth differ in timing. The average economic potential and total factor productivity of different industries differ due to the heterogeneity of the production conditions and scale of development of individual market players.

Still, it is not clear whether corporate resource misallocation will reinforce the effect. Therefore, using the data of A-share listed companies in 2011–2021, this paper investigates the impact of climate change on corporate environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance. According to empirical results, climate change significantly inhibits corporate ESG performance. It also found that continuously eliminating internal and external resource misallocation helps alleviate the adverse effects of climate change on ESG performance. Furthermore, compared with enterprises in non-resource-based cities, climate change will significantly improve corporate ESG performance in resource-based cities, indicating that the adaptive behavior caused by climate change has partially broken the resource curse phenomenon. Additionally, mature and large-scale enterprises mitigate the negative effects better, and external pressure from the public environmental and analysts' attention can motivate companies to improve their ESG performance. The research enriches the research on the impact of climate change on corporate ESG performance and provides a reference basis for enterprises to cope with climate risks.

However, the expansion of agricultural activities poses a threat to this potential. Notably, eucalyptus forests could enhance carbon sequestration and reduce GHG emissions. This study focused on Três Lagoas, known as Brazil's cellulose capital, and aimed to evaluate carbon stock and sequestration for 2030 under business as usual (BAU) and protected forest (PF) scenarios. Combining Cellular Automata (CA) and Random Forest models implemented in Patch-Generating Land Use Simulation (PLUS) and the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model, we simulated land use scenarios and assessed ecosystem services generated by carbon sequestration. The results showed that the PF scenario indicated a higher total carbon stock than the BAU scenario, with a difference of 2.48 Tg. Carbon sequestration varied by period and scenario. Between 2010 and 2020, 3.88 Tg of carbon were sequestered. However, in the next period (2020–2030), the BAU scenario estimated 2.45 Tg in total carbon sequestration. In contrast, the PF scenario predicted 4.93 Tg of carbon sequestration for 2020–2030, surpassing the previous decade. Monetarily, carbon sequestration in 2010–2020 amounted to $92.48 million, decreasing to $58.49 million for 2020–2030 in the BAU scenario. In the PF scenario, sequestration for 2020–2030 increased to $ 117.43 million, nearly double that of the BAU scenario. In conclusion, combining the Ca-Markov/Random Forest and InVEST models revealed the spatiotemporal dynamics of carbon stock and sequestration in the municipality with the largest eucalyptus-planted area in Brazil. The results underscore the significant variability in carbon stocks and sequestration based on classes, periods, and scenarios analyzed. This study contributes valuable insights into the potential for carbon mitigation in this critical region.

The quantification of P M 2 . 5 is a pressing global issue. These little particles can swiftly enter the respiratory system and penetrate the lungs profoundly, resulting in a range of health problems such as respiratory disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and early mortality. Research indicates hybrid deep learning (DL) models outperform individual DL models such as CNN, RNN, GRU, LSTM, and BiLSTM in predicting the P M 2 . 5 pollutant in time series data. However, these hybrid models still need to attain effective performance. This study has proposed a hybrid stacked CNN Bi-LSTM model architecture that incorporates many data perspectives related explicitly to seasonal repeats to generate numerous models. This approach is called Multi-view Stacked CNN Bidirectional-LSTM (MvS CNN-BiLSTM). The suggested approach has been deployed on seventeen individual time series data sets of P M 2 . 5 levels in highly polluted cities in India, using stand-alone deep learning models. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been evaluated by comparing its performance using the RMSE and MAPE metrics. The suggested model has obtained an average enhancement compared to stand-alone DL models on all datasets as follows: RMSE: 7.11% (CNN), 5.08% (RNN), 3.80% (GRU), 5.57% (LSTM), and 4.05% (BiLSTM). Additionally, the MAPE values are 27.16% (CNN), 28.52% (RNN), 26.22% (GRU), 27.22% (LSTM), and 23.11% (BiLSTM). In addition, a non-parametric statistical analysis (Friedman and Holm’s) was conducted, demonstrating that the proposed MvS CNN-BiLSTM outperforms both performance metrics significantly.

However, the role of agri-environmental regulations in promoting green agriculture is understudied. Using Chinese data (1999–2020) and a nonlinear panel threshold model, this paper explores their relationship. We measure the intensity of agri-environmental regulation by the difference in the real and theoretical polluting input consumption and compute agri-green growth by adjusting agricultural output using the cost of agricultural carbon emissions. Results reveal a two-stage impact of regulations on green growth in agriculture. At lower intensity, negative effects are observed, but beyond the threshold, positive impacts emerge. Evidence suggests the mechanism involves the nonlinear influence of agri-environmental regulations on agricultural production methods. We also find that negative impacts reverse faster, and positive impacts are more significant in major grain-producing regions and areas with high state-owned arable land. This study therefore suggests that the government subsidizes farmers at the initial stage of regulation to reduce the environmental costs borne by farmers to motivate them to adopt environmentally friendly production methods for agricultural sustainable green development.

The composite flame retardant (CFR) containing four environmentally-friendly components was prepared and then loaded on porous warm mix agent (WMA) to prepare flame-retarded WMA (FWA). To reveal synergistic suppression mechanisms on the combustion behaviors of asphalt pavement between CFR and WMA, and among the four flame retardant components in CFR, the effects of FWA and CFR on combustion properties of asphalt mixtures were characterized. Results indicate that WMA has abundant well-developed mesopores or interstitial pores to load small CFR particles, facilitating CFR to play a better flame retarded role. Also, CFR shows obvious suppression effects on asphalt mixture combustion in both gas and condensed phases. FWA efficiently retards asphalt mixture combustion because of synergistic effect between CFR and WMA. Further, FWA has a stronger suppression effect on the combustion intensity of asphalt mixture than CFR. CFR and FWA promote asphalt mixtures to inflate, and catalyze the carbonization reaction of asphalt, increasing residual mass fraction and reducing mass loss rate of asphalt mixture. Finally, CFR and FWA reduce gaseous products, showing obvious fume suppression actions. WMA and CFR synergistically reduce the generation of toxic fume.

To this aim, three scenarios have been developed regarding the evolution of the road vehicle fleet composition in terms of the degree of electrification of powertrains, and technical measures such as vehicle efficiency improvements, transport flow, and transport volumes have been considered. The fleet scenarios are further combined with four scenarios deploying different mixes of alternative fuels in 2050, including electricity, e-fuels, liquid/gaseous advanced biofuels and remaining fossil fuel components. Two different electricity production pathways are considered, as well, one of them assuming fully renewable electricity production, and an alternative one including residual shares of nuclear and natural gas power plants plus carbon capture and storage. The Joint Research Centre's DIONE model was used for the scenario calculations. From a tank-to-wheel (TtW) perspective, each scenario reduces energy consumption, mainly due to powertrain electrification, with EU27 TtW road vehicle energy consumption in 2050 ranging from roughly 650 to 1650 TWh, which is 20%–53% of that of 2019. For the most strongly electrified fleet scenario with optimistic assumptions on measures to improve vehicle efficiency, transport flow and transport volumes and renewable electricity production, well-to-tank (WtT) energy consumption is around 110–160 TWh, depending on the fuel scenario. If a moderately electrified fleet is propelled with e-fuels, even when assuming fully renewable electricity and optimistic measures, the WtT energy consumption increases ten times or more, to 1300 TWh (2150 TWh with pessimistic measures). The results show that fleet electrification is the strongest lever for WtW transport energy consumption reduction among the options considered. Other efficiency measures contribute significantly to energy savings, but their benefit decreases with increasing fleet electrification. The production pathways of fuels make a substantial difference for WtW fleet energy requirement if the fleet is moderately electrified, in which case e-fuels require significant amounts of additional renewable electricity. Nevertheless, fuel production pathways become irrelevant from an energetic point of view under very ambitious electrification scenarios since fuel volumes become marginal. The economic feasibility and the societal acceptability of different pathways towards WtW carbon-neutrality of road transport is out of scope of this paper and requires further investigation.";"2024-03-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624005316";"14";"Emissions Other"

However, traditional thermal catalytic CO2 reduction reactions have limited large-scale industrial applications because they typically require temperatures above 500 °C, with virtually no activity at 60 °C. Moreover, high temperatures can cause aggregation of active metal within the catalyst, thereby affecting the catalytic efficiency. In contrast, non-thermal plasma (NTP) can potentially enhance the catalytic system's performance even at 60 °C. Therefore, this study used NTP to enhance the catalytic conversion of CO2 to CO over Cu/CeO2–ZrO2 (Cu/CZO) in a plasma reactor. First, the effects of the catalyst loading and specific input energy of NTP on the CO2 conversion rate were examined. The results showed that at 60 °C, CO2 conversion over 7 wt% Cu/CZO reached a maximum of 37.76%. Subsequently, the gas-phase and surface reactions were decoupled to obtain much needed information about the mechanisms of plasma-enhanced catalytic reactions. The catalysts were characterized using H2-tempreature-programmed desorption (TPD), CO2-TPD, X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy techniques. In-situ spectroscopy was also employed to investigate the active species generated during NTP reactions. The characterization results confirmed that Cu0 serves as the active site for H2 adsorption, while oxygen vacancies act as the active site for CO2 adsorption. Furthermore, it was established that NTP can selectively enhance these two types of active sites, thereby improving the catalyst's adsorption capacity for reactants and exciting ground state CO2 in the gas phase, resulting in improved reaction performance. Finally, based on the obtained evidence, a mechanism is proposed for Cu/CZO catalytic CO2 conversion enhanced by NTP, providing valuable insights for NTP-enhanced catalytic processes.

A useful demonstration of this are the agroforestry grasslands in the Alentejo region of Portugal. This work introduces a simple approach to assess the sustainability of this production system, encompassing social, economic, and environmental dimensions. Based on data from 26 farms from Alentejo and official statistics, we first performed a socioeconomic characterization of the farms and used a regional environmental impact calculator to characterize their environmental performance. Then, six key indicators were computed: Nitrogen (N) self-sufficiency, input costs per hectare, operational net output per hectare, produced live weight (LW) per hectare, N input/output ratio, and greenhouse gas emissions per live weight produced. These metrics enable an evaluation in terms of resilience, economic viability, and environmental impacts. On average, pasture-based beef farms (PBBF) in Alentejo yield a meager operational output (without subsidies) of 3 €/ha while generating 35.6 kg of CO2e emissions per kg LW (not considering carbon sequestration). Results vary significantly across farms, particularly for environmental indicators. This suggests there is high potential for environmental improvements through the adoption of practices and solutions already used by the most efficient farms. From an economic perspective, low operational profitability is the main threat for the production system. Top-performing farms achieve a win-win relation between environmental and economic performance. At the same time a high resilience score does not mean proven benefits.

In this paper effect of methyl diethanolamine (MDEA) flow rate, MDEA temperature, acid gas flow rate, and AGE tower pressure on the outlet H2S and CO2 concentration and energy consumption have been studied. A novel procedure based on enthalpy of combustion in the reaction furnace and incinerator is conducted for energy consumption calculations. By changing MDEA and inlet acid gas flow rates, a maximum H2S concentration in the enriched stream could be attainable. Increasing MDEA temperature will decrease maximum H2S concentration and enriched acid flow rate; also, CO2 concentration in off-gas will be decreased. By increasing AGE pressure, maximum H2S concentration in the enriched stream will be diminished. At higher MDEA flow rates, lower AGE pressures will bring higher H2S concentration in enriched acid gas stream. According to flame temperature simulation in the reaction furnace, energy consumption is directly related to H2S concentration in the sulfur recovery unit (SRU) feed stream. Results show that maximum H2S concentration in the enriched acid gas stream has the best conditions from energy point of view. At optimum conditions, H2S concentration in enriched acid gas is 62.45 mol%, which has been increased by 24.8%, compared with existing plant conditions, and energy consumption has been decreased by 25.05 GJ/h, and CO2 concentration in off-gas is 94.94 mol%.

Due to Iran's dependence on fossil fuels, there are several challenges and concerns related to the reduction of fossil fuel reserves. Therefore, in order to transition from non-renewable to renewable energy sources, the maximum potential of the country should be utilized, which is one of the most promising areas of the islands. As a result, this study aims to provide approaches that reduce dependence on renewable energy sources in a short period of time and to create the conditions for the implementation of a 100 % renewable energy system. First of all, the basic energy supply system for the island in 2020 will be modeled in the EnergyPLAN software. As a next step, two different scenarios are presented for combining new renewable technologies with fossil fuels to meet the demands for electricity, heating, cooling, and transportation in 2030. As a result of this research, it was determined that by utilizing the potential of local renewable resources, the consumption of fossil fuels would be reduced by 36 %. Also, applying policies for the use of renewable resources can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 0.7 million tons per year.

(2) Reveal the spatial pattern laws of low-carbon innovation levels in different types of UAs in the YRB. The spatial pattern in regional level UAs is more complex and hierarchical than that in area level UAs; but there are still gaps in the hierarchy of spatial patterns of low-carbon innovation levels between UAs at the regional level, as well as between UAs at the area level. The spatial pattern of two regional-level UAs in the YRB is transitioning from a low-carbon innovation point-axis to a low-carbon innovation network structure, and the spatial pattern of one regional-level UAs is at the embryonic stage of the low-carbon innovation point-axis structure.

Decisions on which biomass should be targeted for different purposes are dependent on variables such as availability, chemical composition, and sustainability. Consumer perception often positions non-wood sources, such as bamboo, as environmentally preferable feedstocks for fiber-based product production. Yet, this perceived environmental benefit lacks robust scientific substantiation and standardized methodologies. This study addresses this gap by conducting a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) of twelve biomass production systems encompassing tree plantations, dedicated crops, and agricultural residues for energy and bioproducts manufacture. The evaluated feedstocks include southern softwood, wheat straw, rice straw, rice husk, hemp hurd, sugarcane bagasse, switchgrass, biomass sorghum (United States), eucalyptus (Brazil), bamboo (China), and northern softwood (Canada). Incorporating a critical yet often overlooked factor, this LCA integrates the potential soil organic carbon sequestration (SOC) via below-ground biomass for each biomass type. This consideration significantly alters the estimated carbon intensity per ton of feedstock, potentially reshaping sustainability perceptions as certain systems emerge as carbon sinks. From a cradle-to-farm gate perspective, the assessed global warming potential for biomass production spans 12–245 kg CO2eq per oven-dry ton (ODt), factoring only anthropogenic emissions. However, when accounting for SOC sequestration, the range shifts to −170 to 228 kg CO2eq per ODt, highlighting the potential role of biomass to act as carbon sink systems. By illuminating the dynamic influence of SOC sequestration, this study contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of biomass-related carbon emissions, shedding light on pathways to mitigate environmental impact.

Currently, the heat transfer characteristics of PCES walls and their influence mechanisms on the indoor building environment are the key issues to be solved in this field. Based on gypsum-based phase-change materials (PCMs), outdoor, indoor and central PCES walls are designed in this study. Unsteady heat transfer experiments, finite element numerical simulations and energy consumption analyses were used to study the thermal behaviour of PCES walls, and the thermal insulation performance of the buildings utilizing these wall structures were assessed. The results show that the maximum temperature of inner surface of wall with PCMs applying at the interior side is reduced by 0.6 °C, and the maximum temperature lag is reduced by 0.8 h.

In this study, we identified and grouped these factors using a classical geographical dividing line, the Hu-line, which divides China into East and West regions characterized by obvious differences in natural conditions and vegetation distribution. We assessed the possible effects of forest species diversity, climatic conditions, and soil environment on the magnitude of forest biomass and carbon sequestration potential by integrating China's 2009–2018 forest inventory data with environmental information.

Existing literature has explored electric vehicles extensively, but there needs to be more research on electric motorcycles, especially in the Ecuadorian context. This study aims to fill this gap by investigating how environmentalism, a second-order construct formed by awareness, concern, and ecological value, influences the intention to buy electric motorcycles. Using the diffusion of innovation model, mediating variables like observability, complexity, relative advantage, compatibility, and attitude towards electric motorcycles are studied. A survey of 634 e-motorbikes is used to conduct the research, and the PLS-SEM technique is employed to analyse the results. The findings reveal that environmentalism significantly influences attitudes and purchase intention, indicating environmental concern's pivotal role in shaping electric motorcycles' attitudes and purchase intentions. Additionally, compatibility and observability have relevant impacts on attitude and purchase intention. In contrast, complexity and relative advantage do not significantly affect the endogenous variables, suggesting that observability effectively covers considerations of electric motorcycle advantages. The study's robust predictive capacity highlights the connections between environmentalism, innovation diffusion variables, attitude, and purchase intentions for electric motorcycles.

The material footprint is directly linked to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)-8 and 12. The main reason for the material footprint is the usage of fossil fuels, and the dependence of OECD countries on fossil fuels continues to this day. By expanding renewable energy utilization due to rising energy security risk, a community can take steps to improve ecological quality and reduce its material footprint. In this context, the paper focuses to examine the impact of energy security, green innovation, economic policy stringency and income on the fossil fuel material footprint for 24 OECD countries over the period 1995–2018. To this end, the paper uses the Augmented Mean Group (AMG) method and novel Half Panel Jackknife (HPJ) causality and estimation approach. The study adds value to existing knowledge by empirically testing the determinants of fossil fuel material footprint for OECD countries for the first time using the novel HPJ approach. The results of the AMG show that increasing energy security risk index reduces the material footprint, while green innovation and economic policy stringency have no impact on environmental degradation. The environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) in the form of an inverted U and an inverted N are valid for OECD countries. The HPJ approach also illustrates that there is a causality from green innovation and energy security risk to material footprint, and innovation and risk are support footprint reduction. Based on these results, the study recommends that OECD policymakers pay attention to ensuring energy security to reduce the material footprint by expanding renewable resources and allocate more economic resources to green innovations with higher returns, considering the validity of the EKC.

It aims to engage more social actors in forest ecosystem conservation, while pursuing both regional carbon neutrality and poverty alleviation. To explore the dynamics of FCNS, this study examines the roles of local governments, companies, and forest farmers, and develops an evolutionary game model to identify the key determinants of FCNS adoption and the interplay and equilibrium among different stakeholders. The main findings of this study are: (1) The FCNS can reach three stable equilibrium strategies under certain conditions, namely (01,0), (0,1,1), and (1,1,1). (2) The local governments' motivation to promote the FCN depends on factors such as political performance, administrative costs, and transaction subsidies. (3) The companies' participation is influenced by factors such as mandatory and voluntary carbon offset amounts, branding benefits from joining the FCNS, and government penalties for exceeding carbon emission limits. (4) The forest farmers' participation is affected by the development costs of FCN projects and government subsidies. (5) The FCN price should be reasonable, covering the forest farmers' costs of developing and trading the FCN, while keeping the companies' interest, enabling the forest farmers to increase their income, and the companies to reduce their carbon emissions at a fair cost. (6) A higher social awareness of green development will lead to more involvement from the government, companies, and forest farmers. This study fills the research gap on the experiential synthesis and institutional analysis of FCN, and offers policy recommendations for improving the FCNS.

Previous studies have revealed the impact of environmental regulation on enterprises' relocation, but the relationship between urban environmental regulation and its position in the inter-urban pollution transfer network has not been revealed. This paper studies how environmental regulations imposed by local governments have influenced the inter-urban pollution transfer network within a country. Based on theoretical analysis, we apply the econometric models to a unique dataset on firm-level relocation activities of listing polluting enterprises in China from 2010 through 2019. We find that the inter-urban pollution transfer network with hierarchical structures evolves rapidly, and there is increasing nationwide pollution transfer between cities in China. Environmental regulation positively affects urban net out-degree centrality in the pollution transfer network by increasing polluting enterprises’ compliance costs. There is a spillover effect of environmental regulations, and environmental regulations in neighboring cities impact more on local net out-degree centrality in the pollution transfer network.

Yet, their timely uptake in different sectors and distribution across countries are affected by supply options of renewable and fossil energy sources. Here, we analyse the decarbonization of the European energy system towards 2060, covering the power, heat, and industry sectors, and the change in use of hydrogen and carbon capture and storage in these sectors upon Europe’s decoupling from Russian gas. The results indicate that the use of gas is significantly reduced in the power sector, instead being replaced by coal with carbon capture and storage, and with a further expansion of renewable generators. Coal coupled with carbon capture and storage is also used in the steel sector as an intermediary step when Russian gas is neglected, before being fully decarbonized with hydrogen. Hydrogen production mostly relies on natural gas with carbon capture and storage until natural gas is scarce and costly at which time green hydrogen production increases sharply. The disruption of Russian gas imports has significant consequences on the decarbonization pathways for Europe, with local energy sources and carbon capture and storage becoming even more important. Given the highlighted importance of carbon capture and storage in reaching the climate targets, it is essential that policymakers ameliorate regulatory challenges related to these value chains.";"2024-01-05";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623046310";"13";"Emissions Other"

However, the ecosystems carbon stock dynamic, carbon sequestration potential and main driving factors in the economically developed regions of China, Jiangsu Province in recent 40 years are still unclear. Existential quantification scale and interactive human-land coupling relationship pose a great challenge to identify the carbon dynamics pattern in economically developed regions in China. In this study, we used scenarios simulation and main control factor analysis method to identify the spatiotemporal pattern of carbon dynamics in the developed Jiangsu region from 1979 to 2018, and defined and evaluated the sensitivity of different ecosystems to different environmental factors. Furthermore, we separated and quantified the individual and interactive response characteristics of carbon stocks to different environmental factors, and the results showed that Jiangsu has experienced rapid climate change (warming rate +0.5 °C/10a), and warming is a key climate factor leading to a decrease in soil organic carbon (SOC), and decreased by −30.7 g C/m2 during the study period is greater than the promotion effect of precipitation (18.7 g C/m2).Vegetation carbon (VEGC) has no significant response to temperature and precipitation. The pattern of carbon dynamic shows significant spatial heterogeneity. On the whole, there is a trend of increasing carbon storage in coastal areas and decreasing carbon storage in urban agglomeration in southern Jiangsu. The factor analysis results indicate that the CO2 enrichment effect promotes the increase of carbon storage in different carbon reservoirs; The impact of climate change on different carbon pools mainly manifests as negative effects; The interactive effect is manifested as a positive effect, and the sensitivity of carbon stocks to the positive CO2 fertilization effect is greater than that to climate change. In the future, attention should be paid to the impact of double superposition of temperature increase and urban heat island effect on the carbon stocks of coastal wetlands and urban forest ecosystem in southern Jiangsu.

We develop a general model to represent infrastructures that allows for a unique decomposition into ‘elementary infrastructure components’ based on heterogeneous user requirements. Notably, it incorporates a cost function with a very generic and adaptable structure, for which we can still explicitly determine the costs of each individual component. As a direct consequence an intuitive cost allocation rule is obtained: equal component cost sharing. This allocation rule is in line with existing game-theoretic concepts and satisfies the desirable properties of advantageous scaling and coalitional rationality. Advantageous scaling guarantees that the costs allocated to each existing user do not increase if the number of users grows larger and coalitional rationality ensures that there is no subgroup of infrastructure users that would have a financial reason to object to the cost allocation. Additionally, we examine the application of our model to a prospective CO2 transport infrastructure for CCUS in the port of Rotterdam and the adjoining industry area.";"2024-01-05";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623044293";"1";"Emissions Other"

However, the combustion and emissions limitations of ammonia fuel have impeded the development of ammonia engine. As a combustion enhancement technology, the ignition chamber (pre-chamber) jet ignition system has emerged as an effective solution to address the challenges associated with ammonia combustion. This study utilized a high-speed camera to capture the evolution of jet and the combustion processes of ammonia. The combustion method entailed the injection of gasoline into the ignition chamber, while ammonia was injected into the main chamber. The experimental results demonstrated that ignition chamber jet ignition system significantly enhanced ammonia combustion and shortened the combustion duration as compared to spark plug ignition system. The study involved evaluating the ammonia combustion performance under different equivalence ratios (1.0 and 0.8) while comparing it to various gasoline energy percentages (2.5%, 2.0%, 1.5%, and 1.0%). The results revealed that the combustion performance at 1.5% was superior to other gasoline energy percentages. Additionally, in comparison to ignition chamber outlet diameter of 4.5 mm and 6.0 mm, it was found that the 3.0 mm diameter exhibited weak ignition capability, resulting in a 107.1% and 40.3% increase in ignition delay at the equivalence ratio of 0.8, and ignition failure at the equivalence ratio of 0.6. However, its high jet velocity induced a more homogeneous mixing of radicals with ammonia/air, leading to a 30.6% reduction in rapid combustion and a 43.1% decrease in combustion duration at the equivalence ratio of 0.8. Additionally, the investigation of equivalence ratios (0.8, 1.0, and 1.1) demonstrated that the fastest initial combustion of ammonia occurred at the equivalence ratio of 0.8, with an ignition delay of only 4.7ms. Therefore, an appropriate reduction in the equivalence ratio could enhance the ammonia combustion efficiency to some extent. The findings of this study provide a fundamental ignition technique for future applications of zero carbon ammonia engines.

The revitalization of the rural villages is confronted with the shortage of clean and low carbon energy supply. This work proposes a multi-energy complementary distributed energy system (DES) tailored for daily energy consumption in a typical scattered village on the basis of the field survey results. The geothermal heat pump, photovoltaic system (PV), biomass gasification equipment, and other energy conversion devices are integrated in the DES model. The state grid is used as a fundamental ensuring resource to improve the robustness of the system. The improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed to determine the optimal unit capacity configuration by examining investment cost, payback period, system self-sufficiency, accommodation rate, and annual CO2 emissions. The main available renewable energy resources are biomass and solar energy with the annual amount of 1608.9 tons and 1679 kW h/m2. The heat, gas, and electricity load account for 76.84%, 3.14%, and 20.02%, respectively. Based on the daily peak-to-valley price differentials in Beijing of over $0.15/kWh, DES optimization was carried out with PSO module in MATLAB software. The cost of the energy supply with DES, Scenario 3, was compared with that of the mere grid and renewable systems, Scenario 1 and Scenario 2. The direct DES cost is $0.52 million with the internal rate of return of 8.46%, resulting in a payback period of 6.15 years. The overall system self-sufficiency index except for grid achieved a value of 0.42. The application of the DES lead to energy costs of residents and annual carbon emission reduction by 32.5% and more than 3800 tons, respectively, compared to grid-only energy consumption, showcasing the feasibility of grid-aided combined heat and electricity production in rural areas.

Considering the drive for climate-neutral economy among the Nordic states, the current study examines the role of climate change technological development within the countries and technological spillovers across countries in the pursuit for green economy. By using a combination of pooled mean group approach of autoregressive distributed lag (for coefficient estimation) and the recently developed Granger non-causality approach by Juodis et al. (2021) for the panel dataset analysis over the period 1990–2018, the results reveal that both domestic technological development and spillovers from abroad promote long-run green productivity growth in the panel and country-specific estimations. In both estimations, the impact of international diffusion of climate change technologies on green productivity is found to be larger. Additionally, the influence of these two dynamics of climate change-related technologies on attaining greening economy is the most impactful in Sweden. In the remaining Nordic economies, climate change technology spillovers in Denmark are more impactful than in Finland and least in Norway, while climate change technological development in Norway drives green productivity more than in Finland and least in Denmark. As a robust insight, the Granger causality techniques revealed causality from climate change technologies within the countries, climate change technology spillovers, and population to green productivity.

Hence, the active participation of SOEs in green renovation is crucial. The literature mainly focuses on private enterprises and considers stakeholders' benefits from the perspective of economic incentives while neglecting SOEs, which are heterogeneous from private enterprises. To fill this gap in the literature, we propose a synergy mechanism underlying how the parent company and the operations and construction subsidiaries of a typical SOE cooperate and compete with each other to promote the completion of green renovation projects. We use an evolutionary game model to describe the synergy mechanism by analyzing political, economic, and reputational factors. We make the following conclusions: (1) Under the conditions of asymmetric game power, three equilibrium stable strategies are identified. The behavior of the parent company, which is notably influenced by political factors, is critical for the success of green renovation. (2) Political penalties are the fundamental factor breaking the dilemma of low implementation efficiency in green renovation. This event occurs when political penalties for non-incentive management exceeds the cost of incentive management. (3) Each factor exerts varying impacts on the synergy mechanism, with the impact of political, economic, and reputational factors decreasing sequentially. The government can rely on environmental benefit preference and reputational incentives to drive SOEs to actively participate in green renovation.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140242";"China's economic restructuring reduced emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the post-global financial crisis era ";" Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) emissions driven by transboundary supply-chain activities across Chinese provinces are largely unknown. In this study, we comprehensively assessed the dynamics of production-, consumption-, and income-based PAHs emissions from individual Chinese provinces in China from 2007 to 2017. We also examined the critical supply-chain paths and socioeconomic drivers behind the changes in PAHs emissions and explored their correlations with China's economic restructuring during this period. We found that production-, consumption-, and income-based PAHs emissions have decreased to lower levels in 2017 (45.6, 36.2, and 40.1 kt, respectively) than those (52.8, 37.5, and 43.6 kt, respectively) in 2007. The dominant contributors of trade-driven PAHs emissions were located in the northern inland provinces with rich coal resources and the southeastern coastal provinces with dense populations and developed economies. China's economic restructuring reduced PAHs emissions in these provinces in the post-global financial crisis era, benefiting from improvements in emission intensity and trade structure. Concurrently, migrating energy- and emission-intensive industries into less affluent provinces (e.g., Xinjiang, Jiangxi, Henan, Anhui, and Yunnan) changed the roles of emission factors (from the demand side), primary input structure and energy mix (from the supply side) from driving down to driving up PAHs emissions. These changing drivers exerted a greater upward influence on PAHs emissions than the overall downward influence exerted by other drivers, thereby causing emissions outsourcing and leakage. This study explored the effects of economic structural transition on interprovincial trade-driven PAH emission transfer, offering valuable insights for policymakers to formulate policies for mitigating PAHs emissions.

However, sustainable operation of large-scale commercial biogas plants requires attention to numerous factors, including technical aspects (feedstock types, plant size, operational parameters, and biogas and fertilizer utilization strategies), costs (capital investment and operational), and affordability, as affected also by subsidies. This study conducts a case study of the sustainability of an existing operational large-scale biogas plant in Nepal, considering its operational condition, financial status, and environmental benefits under designed capacity and actual operating conditions. Design parameters related to biogas and digestate production, financial viability, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction potential were compared with the realized outcomes of the plant. Operational and financial data for the plant were obtained through visits to the plant supplemented by interviews of the plant manager. The analysis reveals that both the feedstock and digester efficiencies are much lower than the design expectations, by 55% and 62%, respectively. This has led to reductions in the production of biogas and biofertilizers by 72% and 90%, respectively. Moreover, while the internal rate of return (IRR) of the plant at design capacity was 23%, it is indeterminate for the actual operating condition, as the net present value is negative for all discount rates. The biogas plant does generate environmental benefits; the GHG emissions avoided are estimated to be around 274 tons of CO2 equivalent per year under the actual operating conditions. Given these results, it is clear that improving the operational performance of large-scale biogas plants in contexts such as this one should be a priority. Moreover, the findings can help policymakers, investors, and other stakeholders make better plans for future development of biogas facilities, insisting on more realistic and careful assessments of technical and financial viability.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140127";"A novel lightweight CF decision-making approach for highway reconstruction and operation ";" Road infrastructure is a major emitter of greenhouse gases (GHGs), contributing significantly to the overall carbon emissions of many countries. Due to their importance in the life-cycle carbon footprint (CF) assessment of highway projects, highway reconstruction, rehabilitation, and operation have garnered increased attention. Existing highway CF studies have relied heavily on on-site data. They were often limited by a handful of operation or reconstruction scenarios. Most existing highway CF studies focused solely on mitigating the infrastructure CF and ignored the potential savings of highway traffic CF resulting from different traffic behaviour and technology options. A comprehensive CF saving potential comparison between the highway infrastructure and traffic for the city- or nation-wide policy decision-making is needed. Moreover, the loss of design and operation information for many existing highway projects with long operational periods necessitates a new approach to assess and manage the CF of highway reconstruction, rehabilitation, and operation. As a result, this study has proposed a new lightweight CF decision-making approach to help highway reconstruction, rehabilitation, and traffic operation management with informative stage-based highway decision-making supporting framework and digital platform that enable the comparison between highway infrastructure and traffic CF's potential savings. With the help of the developed framework and platform, the project decision-maker and government policymaker can leverage better information support and dynamically compare CF decision-making scenarios regarding different highway infrastructure and traffic options. This study contributes to knowledge in three ways: (1) evaluating and validating an informative highway CF decision-making framework for highway infrastructure and traffic assessment and management, (2) proving the applicability of using a lightweight data collection and model building method for highway infrastructure CF assessment and management practice, and (3) providing an applicable way of building a highway CF digital twins (DT) platform for visualisation, decision-making, and management of the highway infrastructure and traffic.

As per the numerical simulation results, the air purifiers alone significantly reduced the PM2.5 concentration of the bus terminal. The effect of mechanical ventilation units on the PM2.5 reduction is positive without air purifiers but negative with air purifiers. To understand the role of ventilation on the PM2.5 reduction, a simple theoretical model was derived based on the mass conservation of the PM2.5. This model considered the effects of traffic-related PM2.5 emission, air purifiers, and ventilation. The PM2.5 concentrations predicted by the proposed model showed good correlation with those from the CFD simulations. Using the model, we suggested that the ratio of the mass emission rate of PM2.5 to the clean air delivery rate of air purifiers is an important value in determining the effect of ventilation. Moreover, when the background PM2.5 concentration is higher than this value, the ventilation should be limited to reduce the PM2.5 concentration of the bus terminal. An additional CFD simulation showed that limiting the ventilation using walls can reduce the PM2.5 concentration of the bus terminal by 28.6% on average and up to a maximum of 44.2%. The present approach may be useful in improving the health of many commuters by designing openings of bus terminal and efficiently operating mechanical ventilation units.";"2024-01-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623040611";"7";"Emissions Other"

Leveraging data spanning from 2000 to 2020, encompassing fossil energy consumption and economic development, this paper developed a second-order classification model as a new measure of energy elasticity. Comparing regional variations in fossil energy resilience, an in-depth analysis was conducted on four representative provinces to understand the evolution of their fossil energy consumption structures over time. Correlation analysis was employed to reveal the impact of industrial structures on the reduction of fossil energy dependence. The results indicate distinct spatial variations in the energy transition effect, with the southwest inland region retaining a pronounced reliance on fossil energy sources. However, approximately 80% of the provinces have made substantial progress in reducing fossil energy dependence from 2000 to 2020. Notably, the financial sector and the accommodation and catering industry contribute positively to mitigating fossil energy dependence, while the industrial sector exhibits the opposite effect.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140216";"Unlocking sustainable success: Strategic approaches to carbon neutrality ";" This study aims to fill a significant research gap by examining the relationship between resource bricolage, dynamic capabilities (DC), stakeholder engagement, and carbon neutrality (CN) commitment in organizations facing resource constraints. While previous studies have explored various factors influencing CN commitment, limited attention has been given to the role of bricolage and the mediating role of DC in this relationship. Additionally, the boundary conditions of environmental justice orientation (EJO) and stakeholder responsiveness toward environmental uncertainty (SREU) in achieving CN commitments have yet to be extensively investigated. We developed a comprehensive conceptual model based on the resource-based view (RBV), DC theory, and stakeholder theory to address these gaps. Collecting data from 342 Chinese small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) firms using a time-lag approach, we empirically tested the proposed associations using structural equation modeling (SEM). Our findings reveal several noteworthy insights. First, contrary to expectations and prior studies, we found no direct association between bricolage and CN commitment. However, DC mediates the indirect effect of bricolage on firm CN commitment. Second, we identified a significant interaction effect, indicating that a proactive EJO enhances a firm's ability to navigate a changing environment and strengthens its CN commitment. Third, we discovered that SREU negatively moderates the relationship between DC and CN commitment. Overall, this study contributes to the existing literature by shedding light on the multifaceted nature of achieving CN commitments and the importance of DC, stakeholder engagement, and EJO. The practical implications of our findings highlight the need for organizations operating under resource constraints to integrate bricolage and DC while considering stakeholder concerns and fostering environmental justice principles.

The reforming reaction is controlled by the physicochemical characteristics of the catalyst and the initial conditions. Ni-based catalysts have been extensively studied for methane reforming at medium-high temperatures. However, there is limited research on the complex multiphase reforming process using Ni-based catalysts at low temperatures, variable gas flow velocity, multi-component, and high dilution exhaust conditions. Therefore, this study aimed to examine and evaluate the reforming characteristics of modified La–Ni/Ca–Al catalysts, as well as the differences in catalytic physicochemical properties before and after the reforming reaction under the simulated exhaust gas conditions. Characterization results of the catalyst samples demonstrated that the modified catalyst exhibited ideal activity in the low-temperature reforming process, along with good resistance to thermal sintering and carbon deposition. The relative content of CH4 to O2 (M/O ratio) and the temperature of feedstock were identified as critical parameters controlling the reforming reactions. To achieve efficient hydrogen production, the optimum M/O ratio should be within 1.5–2.5, which could guide the efficient operation of our developed reformer. The study determined the critical feedstock temperatures for methane oxidation, steam reforming, and dry reforming reactions activated in the reforming system to be approximately 300 °C, 400 °C, and 500 °C, respectively.

This paper uses real data of China carbon market to simulate the model, it is found that strategies such as relaxation of carbon quotas and carbon subsidies dynamization are needed during the initial development of the market. In the mature stage of the carbon market, strategies are needed to increase the proportion of government carbon revenue and reduce its regulatory cost. The higher the initial willingness of government-enterprise, the better the effect of strategies and the constraints of public willingness. The model and results have theoretical implications for enterprises' energy transformation and government regulation, and provide a reference for the development of China's carbon market.

Despite the global drive towards renewable energy, the limited uptake of solar PV particularly in developing nations, such as Indonesia, poses significant challenges for transition to sustainable energy. This study analyses public discourse to comprehend the obstacles for widespread adoption of solar PV technologies. This study employs topic modelling and sentiment analysis of mainstream and social media data to comprehensively capture public discourse and perceptions concerning PV and residential PV adoption in Indonesia. The findings reveal shared thematic areas in both mainstream and social media. Nonetheless, the two media types diverge significantly in their focal points. Our findings support previous survey-based research while introducing three new topics found in both media channels. These topics are: (1) knowledge, misconceptions, and skepticism, (2) economically viable alternative PV technologies; and (3) government regulations and policies. Social and visual impressions such as aesthetics, hedonic motivation, and social influence are notably absent. Public perception varies, with mainstream media portraying PV technology more positively than social media. From both media, the public generally holds favorable views of PV, particularly in terms of its practicality, installation, safety, and information accessibility.

As a major driver of urbanization, urban transportation sector emits tremendous heat, which intensifies the UHI and further increases the health risks. Meanwhile, under the impact of UHI, emissions of nitrogen oxides and other gases react to generate tropospheric ozone and other harmful pollutants, further degrading urban air quality and posing immense health threats. Therefore, real-time assessment of urban traffic related heat and pollution coupled health risks are imperative, further providing reasonable suggestions of mitigation measures. This study aims to develop a coupled hazard-vulnerability-exposure framework to obtain the hourly spatiotemporal patterns and real-time zoning of health risks from urban traffic. Four districts in Suzhou city are selected as study area, including Wu Zhong, Hu Qiu, Gu Su, and Xiang Cheng districts. Targeted risk alleviation strategies are proposed by reducing vulnerabilities based on blue and green infrastructures, medical infrastructures, and real time shade. Results showed that two peak risk hours were 11:00 and 15:00, with high risks of 49.1% across the study area. Peak risks in central zones were 1.8 times of those in peripheral regions. Medical infrastructure had the largest influence on vulnerability mitigation, followed by green infrastructure. The impact of real-time shading on reducing health hazards substantially increased during sunrise and sunset periods, thus the shading structures or tall trees within traffic zones can be augmented. This work can provide insights into developing urban health risk management and regulation strategies.

The questionnaire presents pairwise comparisons of 12 sustainability sub-criteria organised into economic, social, and environmental categories. The results are analysed using the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in combination with kernel methods to identify consensus regions in the experts’ assessments. The responses showed that a large majority of experts belong to two distinct priority groups: an environmental oriented group (N = 78) and an economic oriented group (N = 21).

The results show that the ESEG in the EU shows an N-shaped growth trend and the spatial pattern of “Western Europe > Eastern Europe > Central Europe > Northern Europe > Southern Europe” from 2001 to 2019. The impact of ERI on the ESEG in the EU presents a “U"" shape, indicating that increasing ERI first reduces ESGE, and after reaching the turning point of ESGE, continuing to increase ERI will promote ESGE. Further analysis shows the ERI have spatial spillover effect on the ESEG, while the spatial spillover effect in the eastern and western regions of the EU is different. Improving the ERI in the western region is not only conducive to the ESEG of the country but also has a positive spillover effect on neighboring countries. However, the spatial agglomeration effect in the eastern region is not significant. In addition to environmental regulation, labor & capital structure, research and development (R&D) expenditure, GDP per capita and trade value have a significant impact on the ESGE of a country and neighboring countries.

To date, no stock-flow consistent study has assessed globally accumulated stocks of mobility infrastructures, associated material flows and emissions, and their spatial patterns. We present global findings on material stocks for all roads, rail-based infrastructures, incl. tunnels and bridges, and model associated material flows and their embodied emissions for the year 2021. The stock-flow consistent model combines crowd-sourced Open Street Maps data with archetypical infrastructure designs, material compositions, assumptions on lifetimes and network growth rates, incl. uncertainty ranges. We derive spatially explicit, national-level stock estimates for 180 countries, map them at a resolution of 5 arcminutes, and derive material flows and their embodied emissions at the country-level. We find that 314 [218–403] Gt of materials (41 [28–53] tons/cap) have accumulated in global mobility infrastructure, the majority in roads as aggregates and asphalt. Stocks are unequally distributed between countries, from averages of 23 [16–30] tons/cap in low income countries, to 130 [89–164] tons/cap in high income countries. Spatial inequality of per capita stocks per area differs by orders of magnitude, from 101-104 between rural, suburban, and dense urban areas. We find that 8 [4–16] Gt/year of material flows are due to expansion and maintenance, amounting to 6 [3–10] % of global resource extraction. These translate into 0.36 [0.19–0.69] Gt CO2eq/year, or 1 [0.5–1.9] % of global GHG emissions in 2021. Approximately two-thirds of these flows result from maintenance and replacement of stocks, indicating an important lock-in of resource use due to already existing infrastructure stocks.

To do so, we use the China Health and Nutrition Survey, which contains detailed longitudinal socioeconomic information from 1989 to 2015, and matches them to weather data. We find that climate change negatively impacts household development resilience. This negative impact stems from both a decline in upward mobility of households and an increase in downside risks. In other words, the rise in temperatures not only reduces the pace of household economic growth but also amplifies economic volatility, elevating consumption risk for households. The effects are driven by the decrease in agricultural production output and the risk of off-farm income. However, longer-run adaptation has offset 22.09% of the short-run effects of climate change on household development resilience.

Using various analytical methods, including context analysis, remote sensing, SPSS correlation and the Sankey analysis, the research examines both weekday and weekend data of Manchester Piccadilly and East Didsbury TODs. Remote sensing analysis reveals Manchester Piccadilly TOD as a UHI hotspot due to concentrated human activities and low Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). East Didsbury TOD, on the other hand, experiences lower UHI intensity because of its lower building and population density. The findings highlight the significant impact of land use and urban morphology on UHI intensity. The paper highlights how TOD-generated commercial and entertainment activities contribute to UHI levels in different locations in Manchester. Factors such as high population density and a higher percentage of workers exacerbate the UHI effect in TODs. The relationship between building heights and UHI challenges the conventional assumption of a positive correlation between floor area ratio (FAR) and UHI. These insights are crucial for TOD planning, emphasising the need to carefully consider land use, population density, and building characteristics in shaping the TOD locations. Implementing measures such as reducing heat emissions from commercial and entertainment activities can lessen the UHI intensity. Providing effective shading in TOD streets and shortening the distance to transit stations can encourage sustainable transportation modes like walking and cycling.

From the perspective of ecosystem services, this study conducted in-depth analysis on the spatial mismatch and drivers of carbon storage demand and supply in the Yangtze River Economic Belt. The hot spot analysis results visually showed a distinct spatial mismatch characteristic between carbon storage service demand and supply both in 2000 and 2017. This characteristic was further quantified by a spatial mismatch index, suggesting an increasing spatial heterogeneity in the mismatch patterns. Additionally, the factor detection result from Geodetector model indicated that land use and socio-economic factors were the dominant drivers affecting the spatial mismatch patterns of carbon storage demand and supply. To determine the specific contribution of the drivers, K-means++ algorithm was used for zoning and a spatial decomposition analysis was further applied. The results suggested the county-level differences of spatial mismatch were mostly due to the between-group differences, which were primarily promoted by urban expansion and partly restrained by population agglomeration.

The plug-in of a large number of DCs to the distribution network (DN) presents both opportunities and challenges for the secure, stable, and sustainable operation of the system. In order to address the planning issues arising from the integration of DCs into the DN, this paper proposes a two-stage (planning stage and operation stage) collaborative planning method for DCs and the DN while considering the source-demand uncertainty. Firstly, spatial-temporal demand response characteristic of DCs is explicitly elaborated, and based on the energy consumption model, a two-stage stochastic planning model considering conditional value at risk (CVaR) for DCs and the DN is constructed using probabilistic stochastic simulation, which obeys low-carbon and security, and satisfies the source-network-load constraints of the system. The siting and sizing for DCs and renewable generation, feeder expansion for the DN are determined to minimize the investment cost during the planning stage, while the power output for the devices considering uncertainties from load and renewable energy are optimized to minimize the operation cost during the operation stage. Secondly, the L-shaped decomposition algorithm is proposed to solve the two-stage stochastic optimization problem by reconstructing the problem into a master problem and subproblems, where the dual multiplies are calculated to generate feasibility cuts and optimality cuts to achieve iterative solving. Finally, numerical case studies on a 33-bus distribution system demonstrate that the participation of DCs in demand response can achieve a significant reduction in the investment and operation cost of the DN, and further promote the consumption of distributed renewable energy sources.

This paper proposes solid particles based on steel slag for highly efficient and durable selective sunlight absorptance and thermal storage. Raw pellets are obtained via a simple extrusion and rolling process, and sinter them to derive solid particles. These particles exhibit excellent selective solar absorption characteristics and have good potential for efficient heat storage. The average solar absorption of the solid particles sintered at 1310 °C reaches 93.20%, and the emissivity at 700 °C is 80.25%. Furthermore, the specific heat and the thermal conductivity of wafer-like materials are 1.09 J/(g·K) and 2.92 W/(m·K), respectively.

Solid particles constitute the key medium for solar photothermal conversion and storage. However, drawbacks such as high thermal radiation loss and poor high-temperature stability limit their application. This paper proposes solid particles based on steel slag for highly efficient and durable selective sunlight absorptance and thermal storage. Raw pellets are obtained via a simple extrusion and rolling process, and sinter them to derive solid particles. These particles exhibit excellent selective solar absorption characteristics and have good potential for efficient heat storage. The average solar absorption of the solid particles sintered at 1310 °C reaches 93.20%, and the emissivity at 700 °C is 80.25%. Furthermore, the specific heat and the thermal conductivity of wafer-like materials are 1.09 J/(g·K) and 2.92 W/(m·K), respectively. In addition, the solid particles are arranged for exhaustive and harsh high-temperature durability tests, and they exhibit an ultra-stable solar weighted absorptance of 93.25 ± 0.09% (mean ± standard deviation), excellent resistance to thermal shock, and superior abrasion resistance. Moreover, the low cost and simplicity of the process greatly enhance the scalability of steel-slag-based solid particles. In summary, by innovatively addressing the challenges faced by solid particles, such as high radiative heat loss, poor heat storage capacity, and high-temperature instability, this study accumulates an advantage in the competition with phase-change and thermochemical materials, and greatly improves the feasibility of using solid particles in large-scale applications.

Solar-driven photocatalysis with near-zero carbon emissions can activate and transform CH4 at ambient temperatures, whereas the reported methanol productivities of traditional solid-liquid photocatalysis are still far from satisfactory. Herein, amorphous CuO x decorated defective WO3 nanocomposites (CuO x /D-WO3) were first synthesized and used as full-spectrum responsive photocatalysts for selective oxidation of LC-CBM to methanol. Introducing oxygen vacancies endows CuO x /D-WO3 with near-infrared (NIR) response. Loading CuO x boosts the separation of photogenerated charge carriers and the generation of ·OH via H2O2 reduction by photoelectrons on CuO x sites, confirmed by photoelectrochemical characterizations and in-situ XPS. Under simulated solar light irradiation, CuO x /D-WO3 exhibited significantly promoted activity of CH4 oxidation compared with the counterpart D-WO3. Even under NIR illumination, the optimal 3.0 % CuO x /D-WO3 showed a methanol production of 1.57 mmol·gcat −1 with selectivity of 79.8 %. Furthermore, a gas-solid-liquid triphase interface was constructed by immobilizing hydrophilic 3.0 % CuO x /D-WO3 on superhydrophobic carbon fiber paper (CFP) to promote methanol generation through strengthening CH4 mass transfer. This triphase photocatalysis exhibited a methanol production of 25.42 mmol·gcat −1, which was ∼4 times higher than solid-liquid diphase catalysis. Methanol selectivity of CuO x /D-WO3/CFP triphase photocatalysis was up to 95.3 %. It was mainly due to enhanced mass transfer of CH4 from gas phase to photocatalysts layer through hydrophobic-hydrophilic wettability abrupt interface of CuO x /D-WO3/CFP, which could be evidenced by significantly increased ·CH3 radicals from in-situ EPR spectra. This work broadens the avenue toward cleaner and efficient utilization of LC-CBM in a sustainable way.

The mechanism aims to balance government and consumer burdens with investor benefits. By factoring in additional income from green certificate sales, the study calculates the internal rate of return (IRR) to fall between 8 and 16% and uses a Monte Carlo simulation to determine optimal FITs for 30 Chinese provinces. These optimal FITs are then compared with current FITs, which are categorized by three types of solar resource regions, revealing that many current FITs are set within an inappropriate range and require adjustment. Additionally, the study observes minor differences in provincial FITs within six regional power grids, suggesting that setting FIT guide prices at the regional grid level is more practical than by solar resource regions. A sensitivity analysis examines the impact of green certificate prices, carbon prices, and technological advancements on the FIT for solar PV, comparing scenarios in a realistic environment versus a more favorable one. The results indicate that in a better environment—with higher TGC and carbon prices and encouraged corporate innovation—the FIT for solar PV is closer to the cost of coal-fired electricity, thus promoting grid parity. The study advocates for adjustments to the FIT mechanism, higher TGC and carbon prices, and the encouragement of innovation to enhance the competitiveness of solar PV energy in China’s energy market.

In this study, the waste heat from a data center is utilized to reduce fossil energy consumption in the tobacco drying process. A heat pump system is designed to address the issue of the waste heat temperature from the data center not meeting the required temperature for tobacco drying. Multi-objective optimization is performed with the goal of maximizing the specific moisture extraction rate and minimizing the specific investment cost, and seven hydrofluoroolefins are selected as the circulating working fluids. Coal-fired tobacco drying and Air Source Heat Pump Tobacco Drying (ASHPTD) are selected as comparison benchmarks to evaluate the energy efficiency and environmental benefits of the Data Center Waste Heat Tobacco Drying (DCWHTD) method in this study.

The specific moisture extraction rate of DCWHTD is improved by 36.69% and 20.21% compared to the coal-fired tobacco drying and ASHPTD, respectively, demonstrating enhanced energy efficiency. Although the specific investment cost of DCWHTD is higher compared with the coal-fired tobacco drying, it is 21.00% lower than that of ASHPTD. DCWHTD produces fewer emissions, the life-cycle carbon emissions are 26.93% and 16.80% lower than that of the coal-fired tobacco drying and ASHPTD, respectively.

Previous research focused on the direct effects of energy and water policies (i.e., an energy policy's effects on energy conservation, and a water policy's effects on water resource conservation) and on the indirect effects (i.e., an energy policy's effects on water resource conservation, and a water policy's effects on energy conservation). However, they neglected the cumulative effects (i.e., the effects under simultaneous implementation of the two policies, which differs from the sum of the effects under separate implementation of the two policies). This is an important omission given that both economic policies are implemented simultaneously, and exhibit interactions that produce cumulative effects. In the present study, we developed a framework to analyze the cumulative effects of water and energy policies. In this framework, we developed a computable general equilibrium model and a model to assess their cumulative effect. The cumulative effects were analyzed from both the environment and macroeconomy perspectives. China was adopted as a case study. We found that the cumulative effects on energy conservation, water conservation, and carbon emission reduction were greater than the effects of only one kind of policy, but that antagonistic effects also occurred, with their strength increasing with increasing intensity of the policy.

A field experiment was conducted over a period of 4 months to evaluate the effects of different treatments during the natural decomposition of bamboo shoot shells.The treatment groups consisted of the boiled experimental group (EG) and the control group (CG). Results showed that in EG, the methane emission increased by 8.6% (P < 0.05), the carbon dioxide emission increased significantly by 19.7% (P < 0.01), and the nitrous oxide emission decreased by 37.9% (P < 0.01) relative to those in CG. Regression analysis was employed to establish a relationship model between CH4, CO2, and N2O emission fluxes and temperature and humidity in the EG and CG groups. A specific functional relationship was identified between CH4 and CO2 emission fluxes and temperature and humidity, but N2O emission was present. No significant correlation was found between flux and ambient temperature and humidity (R2 < 0.3). We also estimated that the carbon dioxide emissions and water consumption of producing 1 kg of canned bamboo shoots were 2.8669 kg and 86.8 L, covering the processes in the life cycle of bamboo shoot products.

This work compared the costs and environmental impacts of algal biofuels across different pond failure scenarios. Pond failure was simulated by a reliability model based on pond mean-time-to-failure (MTTF). The reliability model was integrated with a process model to analyze the impacts of pond failure on the operations of algal farms and biorefineries. Process model outputs were used for techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment to determine the minimum fuel selling price (MFSP), global warming potential (GWP), and freshwater consumption impacts of algal biofuels for five MTTF scenarios of 20, 54, 80,120, and 350 days, assuming an average mean-time-to-reset of 7 days. Results show that higher MTTFs reduce the cost and environmental impact of algal biofuels, but with diminishing returns. The average MFSPs for the 20-day, 54-day, and 350-day MTTF scenarios were $3.52, $2.54, and $2.10 per liter of gasoline equivalent, respectively. The GWP for the same scenarios were131, 96, and 83 g CO2eq MJ−1, respectively. This study highlights the significant impact of larger seed trains, required under low MTTFs, on the costs and greenhouse gas emissions of algal biofuels.

The study employs the Box-Behnken experimental design approach implemented through the Design Expert software to investigate and optimize the performance of electrochemical hydrogen extraction from Ocean water from an integrated reactor. The integrated electrochemical continuous-type electrodeionization reactor comprises two cation-permeable membranes that operate as boundaries between three compartments: a central compartment and electrode compartments that house the cathode and anode, each of which may reverse polarity. These membranes are made of gel polystyrene cross-linked with divinylbenzene, which has acidic properties that allow cation transport while inhibiting anions. The integrated reactor's electrode chambers are enclosed in plexiglass end plates and contain distinct Plexiglass electrode compartments. These compartments have mesh and solid steel anode and cathode electrodes, with an electrode active area of 176.71 cm2. The influence of various factors, such as voltage and electrolyte amount, on the production of hydrogen synthesis is examined. The study results demonstrate a maximum hydrogen production rate of 2.2 mg/min and a hydrogen production efficiency of 7.82%.

Despite their ecological importance, the state of environmental quality in fragmented mangrove patches, especially emerging contaminants, remains largely uncharted. Our research presented an in-depth analysis of the distribution of perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) across porewater, suspended particles, and sediment in these small, fragmented mangroves, revealing the mechanisms behind their distribution. The findings indicated that PFAA concentrations in sediments were generally lower than in suspended particles, except for C12–C14 perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and C4–C6 perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs). A comparison of contamination levels in different mangrove patches concurred with conventional water quality assessments and crab burrow surveys, showing that large artificially planted patches were less contaminated, while areas with intense human activity were more polluted. Notably, no significant differences were observed in the concentrations of long-chain PFAAs and PFCAs between patches (p > 0.1). Elevated crab burrowing activity and higher concentrations of perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS) in suspended particles in low intertidal zones suggested that seafood, particularly crabs and shellfish, might be at risk of PFAA pollution. Rainfall-runoff was identified as the primary source of PFAA pollution in porewater and suspended particle systems in these areas.

Nevertheless, water coning/cresting in these reservoirs leads to high water cuts, substantial oil production reductions, and major water-handling issues for surface facilities. The Gas-Downhole Water-Sink-Assisted Gravity Drainage (GDWS-AGD) process can enhance oil recovery (EOR) in such reservoirs and mitigate the influx of aquifer water into the oil zone. This study compares the performance of GDWS-AGD and GAGD processes based on reservoir-simulation results for two heterogeneous reservoirs: the PUNQ-S3 reservoir and the giant South Rumaila (SR) oil field (Iraq). The PUNQ-S3 simulation exclusively employs carbon dioxide (CO2) as the injected gas. In contrast, the SR simulation evaluates the CO2 injection in comparison to petroleum-associated gas (PAG). The GDWS-AGD process performance was assessed based on oil recovery factor, water cut, gas-to-oil ratio (GOR) in oil producers, cumulative volumes of gas injected, and oil/gas saturations. The PUNQ-S3 simulation employs six wells: two vertical CO2 injectors with perforations at the top of the reservoir to form a gas-cap zone. Additionally, there are two horizontal oil-production wells and two horizontal water-production wells positioned below the oil-water contact (OWC). The GDWS-AGD process was assessed in the SR simulation, using CO2 and PAG, in several configurations to compare it with the basic GAGD. In the SR design, twenty-two vertical gas-injection wells, ten horizontal oil-production wells, and six horizontal water-production wells were placed in the gas-, oil-, and water-bearing zones, respectively. A vertical well was dual-completed with two lateral sections originating from separate kick-off points above and underneath the OWC with 2–3/8-inch tubing for oil and water production, respectively. Hydraulic packers in the vertical wellbore separate oil and water production tubing in the dual-completion configuration, and electric-submersible pumps are then employed for water production. The downhole-water-sink configuration effectively reduces oil-reservoir pressure and minimizes water cut/cresting tendencies. CO2 remains immiscible due to reduced gas-injection pressure and decreased solubility. The CO2-based simulation of the SR field yielded oil-recovery factors of 71.67%, 75.25%, and 76.162% for the GAGD, basic, and advanced GDWS-AGD setups, respectively. The oil-recovery factor of GDWS-AGD was further increased to 82.64% by implementing PAG injection, resulting in a decrease in water cut to 5% in all oil producers. Although PAG gas injection outperforms CO2 in oil recovery, water cut, and gas injectivity in the SR field simulation, the GDWS-AGD approach with CO2 remains a feasible option. This technology has the capability to effectively capture and store significant amounts of CO2 in the flooded reservoir for many years, thereby mitigating carbon emissions associated with fossil fuel usage.

Issues such as liquid water flooding and membrane drying significantly reduce their performance and durability during higher current density operations. Although many simplified 1-D and 2-D models have been proposed, they do not aid in understanding water dynamics and membrane water content for different flow configurations and operating temperatures. This work focuses on the development of a 3-D, multiphase, non-isothermal, physics-based model of the LT-PEMFC to address the above-mentioned issues. The model is validated with experiments performed on a 32 cm2 LT-PEMFC at 40 °C with a hybrid flow configuration. The results suggest that the hybrid configuration provides a power density enhancement of 12 % compared to the parallel configuration at 70 °C. Due to this performance improvement, ΔT of the hybrid configuration has reached 7 °C, which is slightly higher than the parallel configuration's ΔT of 5.7 °C. With an increase in operating temperature from 40 °C to 70 °C, the hybrid configuration experiences a 50% enhancement in the power density. For both temperatures, the hybrid configuration shows a consistent increment in the saturation from inlet to outlet, which creates a favorable pathway for water removal from the cell. The findings from this work suggest that the hybrid configuration is superior to the parallel configuration in terms of power density output, water removal capacity and membrane water content.

Looking at the whole microbial community, the competitive and cooperative relationships were more complex in the sediment samples. The N2O flux was positively correlated with the plastic degradation function in sediment (p < 0.05), implying the plastisphere was a significant contributor. Microplastics in lakes, i.e., the plastisphere, may be a novel microbial colonization site that could be vital to ecosystem N2O emissions.

CO2 has been demonstrated as a comparable alternative for water in developing an Enhanced geothermal system (EGS), which simultaneously unlocks the potential to sequester CO2 against climate concerns. However, an earlier thermal breakthrough is always observed owing to higher mobility in geothermal reservoirs for CO2-EGS, and an expensive cost of CO2 consumption makes CO2-EGS challenging to achieve economic profitability. In this study, a novel CO2-water-EGS is proposed to investigate the feasibility of solving the obstacles in conventional EGSs. An integrated analysis for multiple EGS scenarios is carried out from both the technical and economic perspectives. The effects of a CO2-water ratio, an injection rate and a flow scheme are comprehended. Followed by the determination of an optimal operating strategy. In the results, by reasonably selecting a CO2 mass ratio and an injection rate, CO2-water-EGS can recover more geothermal energy and earn more profits than water-EGS and CO2-EGS. The injection rate shows positive correlations to heat mining, carbon storage, and economic performance, while the impact of a flow scheme is negligible when the total volume of injected fluids remains consistent. From the optimization study, the CO2-water-EGS with the 110 kg/s injection rate and 20%wt CO2 ratio shows the highest Net Present Value (NPV) of 42.4 M$. This study proposes theoretical guidance to operators in their decision-making processes on the development of CO2-water-EGS.

The study on dynamic response of the ORC-EERC combined system plays a particularly important role in optimizing the control strategy for the system, given the instability of the low-temperature heat source. In this paper, the ORC-EERC dynamic models with single and dual condensers are proposed. The simulation results show that the proposed improved model of EERC subsystem presents more accurate results relevant to the experiment system. The impact of the ORC subsystem on the refrigeration subsystem is more pronounced in the ORC-EERC system with a single condenser than in the system with dual condensers. In addition, the phenomenon of chocking in the ejector throat leads to the degradation of system performance when the heat source is disturbed.

The effective management of the WEF nexus has emerged as a pivotal component of sustainable development strategies. Based on the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework, this research establishes a comprehensive WEF nexus assessment indicator system to scrutinize the interrelationships and coordination mechanisms among these three essential systems. This study investigates the spatio-temporal characteristics and obstacle factors within the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) from 2012 to 2022 using the coupling coordination degree (CCD) model and obstacle factor diagnosis (OFD) model.

Therefore, assessing and reducing the environmental impacts of livestock production under different farming systems has become an important area of solution-oriented research in sustainability sciences. A case study in northern China on beef cattle, pig, broiler, layer and dairy farm systems was used to analyze the water footprint (WF) and N emissions in producing units of products from cradle-to-farm-gate based on the life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Possible ways to change feed components and manure management to reduce environmental impacts were assessed. The results showed that 98.1%–99.4% of the water consumption in beef, pork, chicken, egg and milk production was from feed production. The N losses in livestock products were mainly caused by ammonia (NH3) emission by 53.8–83.5%, nitrous oxide emission by 6.4–17.3%, and N leaching by 6.1–16.8%. Life cycle assessment indicated that the green, blue, grey and total WFs of livestock products could be reduced by 9.9–31.4%, 21.6–70.6%, (−9.8)-38.0%, and 14.7–32.4%, respectively, by optimizing the feed composition. Changing feed composition, improving housing facilities (such as by using padded floor for beef cattle, pig, and dairy farm systems), using household biogas facilities to treat manure or coupling all of the above strategies could reduce the nitrogen footprint (NF) by an average of 29.4%, 4.6%, 16.2% and 43.2%, respectively, for all farming systems. Changing feed composition, using a padded floor and using household biogas treatment on manure were effective practices in reducing water consumption and nitrogen emissions from livestock farming systems, with an overall positive influence on reducing the overall WF and NF for livestock systems in northern China.

However, since conventional wet scrubbing techniques mostly rely on mechanically generated water droplets, they have intrinsically limited in collection efficiencies of a single droplet. In addition, PM capturing strategies for removal of fine PM need to be established to enhance PM removal performance based on flow dynamics. Here, we propose a steam flow of water droplets generated by a photothermal membrane for air purification.

The core of regulation accuracy is the high-fidelity modeling of pumped storage. This paper improves the insufficiency of the conventional pumped storage model (CPSM) in exaggerating the flexibility of pumped storage units by setting up non-operable operating condition regions, and incorporates the condition switching loss into the model consideration, on the basis of which a high fidelity pumped storage model (HFPSM) is established. Secondly, a multi-objective function of the operation model is set from the consideration of economy, environmental protection and stability, and a engineering application level optimal operation model of wind power-photovoltaic-thermal power-pumped storage multi-energy co-generation system based on HFPSM is proposed. Thirdly, two research indicators, the thermal power volatility indicator and the pumped storage unit utilization rate, are proposed. Fourthly, combined with examples, the effects of CPSM and HFPSM on the optimized operation of the system are investigated. It is found that adding four 50MW pumped storage units to the system can reduce the total operating cost by 10.34% and the environmental cost by 83.61%. The optimization of the high fidelity model is better under the premise of ensuring safe, stable and efficient operation of the system. Optimizing the number of unit startups and shutdowns for the high fidelity model to 25.8% of the conventional model. Finally, by exploring the optimal operation of a multi-energy co-generation system with different pumped storage installed capacities, it is found that the proposed high fidelity model makes the optimization results more in line with the actual operation. The flexibility of the pumped storage units no longer increases with the increase of installed capacity, which provides a reference for the planning of the storage capacity in the multi-energy co-generation system.

This study developed methodological approaches for life cycle assessment (cradle to gate) of structural glued laminated bamboo (SGLB) produced from moso bamboo (Phyllostachys edulis), including measuring and calculating biogenic carbon storage and emissions during the manufacturing process. Primary data was collected through experiments and field investigation resulting in development of world's first life cycle inventory (LCI) of SGLB; background data from Ecoinvent 3.10 was used, and the analysis was performed using OpenLCA 2.1: IPCC 2021 method AR6. Uncertainty analysis was conducted using Monte Carlo Simulation. The results illustrate that SGLB can store 1140 kgCO2e/m3, which is more than twice biogenic CO2 emitted (467 ± 9.1 kgCO2e/m3) during its production. Electricity, adhesive, and transportation are the top three emission sources, among which electricity contributed to 71% of the final emission and was mainly consumed at the fine-planed bamboo strip processing factories. The production process generates around 60% of bamboo co-products, which can be effectively used for heat and power co-generation that can drastically reduce the carbon emissions to 156 kgCO2e/m3. In addition, maximal use of sea transportation between factory gate and consumer can further mitigate carbon emission.

Long-term monitoring of extreme high temperatures in cities can provide a foundational framework for mitigating the urban heat environment and enhancing the livability of residents. Utilizing long-term MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data, this study examined the fluctuations of extreme high temperatures, as well as the distribution of urban populations exposed to heat extremes and the associated health risks for urban residents across 289 prefecture-level and above cities in China from 2002 to 2020, considering natural, population and economic regional scales. The results indicated that: (1) Variations in extreme high temperatures. Extreme LST thresholds exhibited an upward trend, with the nighttime growth rate being 0.24 °C/decade higher than the day. Regions characterized by higher extreme LST thresholds during the day were concentrated in Northwest and North China, while nighttime were primarily found in South Central and East China. Furthermore, regions showing higher extreme LST thresholds during the day and night were situated in well-developed cities. (2) Changes in cities exposed to heat extremes. Over the past 19 years, the majority of cities have been exposed to compound extreme high temperatures, and the number of such cities increased from 230 to 256. Notably, nearly 42% of cities have been exposed to extreme high temperatures for 15 consecutive years or longer, particularly concentrated in East China and South Central China. Developed cities were more likely to endure persistent heat extremes, especially those with a population of over 5 million and a per capita GDP of over 20,000, which have almost continuously experienced heat extreme exposure for the past 19 years.

Among its reasons, we can mention climate changes and global warming, population growth and increasing demand for energy, the limitation of fossil resources and their price increase, and issues such as energy security. Renewable energy has different types such as solar energy, biofuel energy, wind energy, geothermal energy, etc. Reports show that most of the pollution is related to the transportation sector. Since bioenergy can be used for heat, electricity, and fuel purposes, some countries use it as an alternative or hybrid fuel. Using biofuels has economic, social, and environmental advantages and helps sustainable development. In the current research, the interaction between the farmer, the biorefinery, and the government has been investigated under six scenarios. The farmer determines the amount of land allocated to second-generation biomass cultivation. Biorefinery specifies the technology level and process of biofuel production. Since biofuel production processes are regularly being investigated in laboratories and have a growing trend, The concept of technology level is also considered to examine different states of low-level technology to high-level technology.

This study considers air quality information, refines ecological remote sensing indices, and employs the Random Forest-Multiscale Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression (RF-MGTWR) analytical framework to reveal the nonlinear effects and spatiotemporal heterogeneity between landscape patterns and ecological environmental quality across the dimensions of aggregation, connectivity, and diversity. The results indicate:(1) ARSEI (Advanced Remote Sensing Ecological Index) is more suitable for assessing ecological environment quality in areas with air pollution compared to RSEI (Remote Sensing Ecological Index). (2) Ecological environmental quality is most strongly influenced by landscape connectivity, followed by diversity and aggregation. The driving effects of landscape aggregation, diversity, and connectivity will change around the values of 91, 0.64, and 80, respectively, all exhibiting complex nonlinear relationships.(3) Landscape patterns exhibit opposing trends in ecological benefits between urban centers and rural areas: In urban centers, landscape aggregation is negatively correlated with ecological environmental quality, while increased connectivity and diversity have positive effects; this is reversed in areas with good ecological conditions. As urbanization progresses, the positive impacts of landscape connectivity and diversity are enhanced, although the positive effects of diversity gradually diminish.

This study investigates the impact of female officials on urban environmental pollution in China over the period from 2003 to 2018. Utilizing data from the China Urban Statistical Yearbook combined with individual profiles of officials at the prefecture level, the analysis reveals a notable decrease in urban environmental pollution associated with female leadership. Notably, the effect is more pronounced among younger female officials compared to their older counterparts, and those with higher education levels are particularly effective in curbing pollution emissions. The pollution abatement effect of female officials is found to be stronger in the central regions compared to the eastern and western regions. The robustness of these findings is confirmed through checks against alternative explanatory variables, permutation tests, and treatment effect analyses. Overall, this research contributes new perspectives on management strategies that can sisgnificantly improve urban environmental quality in China.

Land-use and land-cover changes (LUCCs) are the major factors in terrestrial ecosystem carbon storage (TECS) change. However, they are not yet sure how future LUCCs would affect the TECS in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) to meet China's carbon-neutral goal. We simulated eight land-use change scenarios and used these to estimate the YREB's TECS and its 2020–2060 variation by coupling the spatially explicit projections of LUCCs under the latest IPCC, combining shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) and representative concentration pathways (RCPs) with datasets on terrestrial ecosystem carbon density dataset. Results show that: 1) the total TECS of the YREB in 2020 is ∼28.07 Gt. Spatially, TECS in the YREB focused on Sichuan and Yunnan (∼13.35 Gt), which plays a crucial role in balancing the regional carbon cycle; its losses are in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Hunan provinces; Yunnan is the potential region with future carbon sink enhancement in the YREB. 2) Compared to the TECS change under eight land-use scenarios, the low-carbon and sustainable development pathways are the priority chosen by humans. 3) The replacement of vast forest land with cropland and urban expansion are the key factor of TECS change in the YREB. 4) Land management policies (i.e., Cultivated land requisition-compensation balance) should balance the conflicts between food self-sufficiency and the carbon sink rather than only the dynamic balance in quantity. Our study aims to provide data support for the government in planning future development pathways and refining carbon emission reduction strategies to assist in carbon trading and compensation and achieve the YREB's dual-carbon goal.

Within built environment, the intricate interplay of human and greenspace primarily influences outdoor air quality. Therefore, to facilitate effective urban planning, the study investigates their complex interactions during the wet (May to October) and dry (November to April) seasons. This research employs landscape metrics to assess greenspace configurations within various buffers around 73 in-situ air quality moniroting stations accross Taiwan. These landscape metrics, anthorpogenic variables were utilized to construct the dimension of greenspace (GS) and anthoropogenic component (AC), respectively. Recorded air quality data were used to define the dimensions of outdoor air (OADs), encompassing air temperature (TEMP), wind speed (WS), relative humidity (RH), particle pollutant (PP), gaseous pollutant (GP), and OZONE. Subsequently, Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modeling was employed to explore the hypothesized relationships among these eight dimensions for each buffer and season. Results show that the AC exerts a more pronounced influence on the OADs compared to the GS. The GS shows greater effectiveness in mitigating the PP than the GP, while the AC substantially amplifies the GP during the two seasons. The GS and AC exhibit contrasting effects on the TEMP, RH, and GP. The GS exclusively affects the PP, while its effects on the OZONE and WS are insignificant during both seasons. Conversely, the AC has a negligible effect on the PP, but significantly impacts the OZONE, and WS. Through the GS, the AC indirectly influences the RH, PP, and GP during the two seasons, along with the TEMP during the wet season. Notably, the seven landscape metrics are identified for the GS, providing potential indicators for urban green planning to maximize its ecosystem services.

However, there is currently a lack of explicit research that identifies the energy-saving effects of AI methods as compared to the conventional practices employed in factories, which involve the replacement of equipment with high energy efficiency (non-AI method), with respect to variance in the effectiveness. Thus, this ignited the motivation for this study, wherein the research team developed a “Universal AI workflow for energy saving” which adopted a standard workflow of “learning, Modeling, and Prediction.” Additionally, a three-year research project was launched to conduct empirical tests in ten factories, comparing the efficacy differences between AI and Non-AI methods. In 2021, research team established the energy consumption baselines for each factory through data collection; the entirety of 2022 was dedicated to AI integrations; and energy-saving benefits were evaluated in 2023. During the research period, each factory also implemented other non-AI energy-saving methods which were juxtaposed with AI approaches for comparison. Our study results showed that average AI-enabled energy savings across the ten factories amounted to 106,124 kWh/yr, while average energy savings from non-AI methods amounted to 1,231,625 kWh/yr. Despite the inferior energy-saving results, the AI methods had an average return on investment (ROI) of 0.46 years while non-AI methods had an average ROI of 6.22 years, indicating that AI methods could recover the investment costs through energy savings in less than one year. It is also worth noting that the ten factories produced a diverse range of products encompassing wafers, steel, and foods, but the AI methods used for energy saving employed the same workflow. By contrast, the non-AI methods necessitated distinct workflows and detailed engineering adjustments. It can be inferred from these empirical findings that AI techniques for achieving energy-saving control in factories can be integrated using standardized processes. In summary, AI methods can facilitate standardized workflows in factories and offer substantial energy-saving benefits that can typically cover investments within a year. AI represents a highly viable energy conservation option for factories seeking to maintain uniformity in product processes and realize efficient ROIs.

This study will also look at the effect of using GIoT applications on energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction, which in turn, contributes to the sustainable green performance. Therefore, value-belief-norm theory (VBN) was chosen as the theoretical basis for this study's conceptual model. Two constructs derived from VBN (i.e. biospheric value and ecological worldview) are suggested as key predictors for the use of GIoT applications. The conceptual model is extended by considering the role of green marketing orientation (GMO); green energy awareness; and energy knowledge/technical capabilities. The current model also suggests that the utilization of GIoT applications would impact both energy efficiency and carbon footprint reduction. Online questionnaires are used to gather data from a purposive sample (n = 500) of managers and employees at different levels in different service organizations. Statistical results show strong evidence demonstrating the significant effect of biospheric value; ecological worldview; green marketing orientation (GMO); and energy knowledge/technical capabilities with GIoT.

Mathematical modeling tools facilitate sustainability assessment in support of integrated policymaking. This study examines the interlinkages between the SDGs with commonly used and broadly applicable energy system models (ESMs) using the 248 indicators defined by the United Nations. The SDGs are classified under the environment (SDGs 6, 7, 12, 13, 14, 15), economy (SDGs 8, 9, 10, 11, 17), and society (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 16) domains governing the sustainability framework. The results ascertain that current ESMs are conceived to prioritize energy-related environmental indicators related to SDG7 (Affordable and Clean Energy), SDG12 (Responsible Consumption and Production) and SDG13 (Climate Action) with limited focus on non-energy indicators of the environmental domain, along with little to no coverage of SDGs-indicators allocated within the economic and social domains, respectively. The findings call for expanding the frontiers of ESMs to incorporate emerging systemic interdependencies that extend beyond the traditional “energy-environmental” nexus considering the multi-dimensional facets of sustainable development. For this purpose, a conceptual integrated framework was developed underscoring procedural protocols and technical directives to advance the ESMs-SDGs modeling paradigm through the application of methodological improvement opportunities. Theoretical and practical implications driven by policy and managerial perspectives were also discussed. In closure, this study can inform stakeholders about the gaps (sustainability issues and corresponding targets-indicators) that are imperative to address in modeling the SDGs and how to leverage existing ESMs into integrating a broader range of SDGs beyond traditional considerations. The improved outcomes are expected to facilitate integrated sustainable policy planning and formulation in pursuit of operationalizing the SDGs for the timely attainment of the 2030 agenda.

The use of charcoal in self-reducing iron ore briquettes can be an alternative to reduce fossil fuel consumption and reduce carbon emissions in the primary steelmaking industry, however, the particle size can affect the reduction process. This study aims to analyze the reduction kinetics of charcoal briquettes in three particle size ranges. To this end, the charcoal was characterized using thermogravimetric analysis to determine the contents of fixed carbon, ash and volatiles, analysis of sulphur in the charcoal by combustion in a tube furnace, determination of particle size by laser granulometer, elemental chemical analysis of the charcoal ash by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry. The briquettes were reduced in a thermogravimetric balance to 1100 °C with heating rates between 10 and 40 °C/min. They were characterized by X-ray diffraction. Finally, a kinetic study was carried out using the Coats-Redfern method. In all the briquettes, the controlling mechanism was diffusion.

Following the 2018 European directive RED II, these projects have rapidly increased across the continent, showcasing their potential for creating sustainable local energy systems. While studies highlight economic, environmental, and social benefits, barriers such as regulatory challenges, finance access, and low public awareness remain. This paper presents the results of a systematic literature review that explores the state-of-the-art of the academic research on energy communities. The study adopts a systematic approach to examine the body of literature on the topic to provide a comprehensive analysis of the phenomenon on the basis of rigorous and replicable research criteria. The reviewed material consists of 140 articles collected through the Scopus database, evaluated using specific structural dimensions to group the literature into analytical categories. The analysis of scientific papers published between 2018 and 2022 shows a growing attention towards Renewable Energy Communities, particularly those based on solar energy for electricity production, often combined with storage systems and heat pumps, whereas attention towards energy communities based on thermal energy production is still limited. Furthermore, most scholars focused on analysing specific territorial contexts; comparisons between different regions allows to highlight common features and elements characterizing each model. It emerged that the development of energy communities depends mainly on regulatory, financial, and managerial barriers that require an adequate institutional and legal framework capable of promoting their diffusion. Most studies address the topic from an economic perspective, often in association with incentivizing community models. However, a social perspective should be included by introducing the concept of energy sharing and methodologies for its distribution among all members of the community. The scientific community is called upon to continue investigating and supporting the development of community energy initiatives by providing evidence-based recommendations to policymakers, industry stakeholders, and local communities. This can help to overcome existing barriers and facilitate the diffusion of energy communities models, contributing to the achievement of sustainable and inclusive energy transition goals.

While recent research has focused on the performance of biochar-cement materials, limited attention is given to the durability of biochar in cementitious materials. This study investigated the alterations in the structural, chemical, and mechanical properties of biochar in the cementitious system and marine environment. The results showed an increased pore size in the biochar and a potential collapse of its structure after long-term exposure of biochar to an alkaline cement environment. The decline of the aromaticity, 23.8% increase in matrix defectiveness, and formation of organometallic complexes between Ca2+ and oxygen-containing functional groups of biochar indicated that its interactions with hydrated cement would lead to the changes in its chemical properties. The exposure of biochar to the simulated cement solution reduced its Young’s modulus from 3.81 GPa to 1.55 GPa and hardness from 0.70 GPa to 0.13 GPa possibly due to the collapse of the pore structure. The saponification reaction might disrupt the cross-linking network structure constructed by COOC and C–O–C in the biochar and release the fulvic-acid organics, causing a decrease in the short- and long-term rebound ratios by 5.6–25.6% and 5–17%, respectively. Biochar exposed to the simulated harsh environment (seawater) exhibited an increase in Young’s modulus and hardness by ∼40% compared to virgin biochar. The long-term rebound ratio reached 96.6–99.2% due to brucite, NaCl, and KCl deposition and filling, implying the potential advantage of biochar-cement composites for long-term durability in the marine environment.

Unlike the research on energy transition pathways under carbon reduction targets or the simulation of carbon reduction effects under ""portfolio"" policies, the study takes China as an example, incorporates the reduction of fossil energy use into the theoretical framework of sustainable development, and adopts computable general equilibrium (CGE) theory to construct a closed macroeconomic system to describe China's existing economic structure. The main objective of the study is to discuss the impacts of fossil energy use reduction on China's existing economic structure under the carbon neutrality goal, and to develop new research ideas for countries around the world to achieve carbon neutrality with high quality. We find that the reduction in fossil energy use has a large impact on the current structure of China's economy. Both MM and related manufacturing sectors have maximum output declines of more than 11.3%. The Ser sector has the smallest impact, with a maximum output decline of 9.1%. Because sectors such as Electricity and Hot Water Combustion mainly rely on fossil energy sources such as coal to generate electricity, their output is the most affected compared to other sectors, with a maximum output decline of 22.69%. In addition, the dynamic simulation relies on the reduction of fossil energy use to drive China's existing economic structure to seek a new equilibrium.

We found that: (1) except for low-elevation farmland, the interannual relationship of vegetation NPP with CO2 (R NPP-CO2 ), precipitation accumulation (R NPP-PA ), soil moisture (R NPP-SM ), downward surface shortwave radiation (R NPP-SR ) and minimum temperature (R NPP-TMN ) is mainly positive, while the relationship with maximum temperature (TMAX, R NPP-TMX ) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD, R NPP-VPD ) is mainly negative, indicating that most hydrothermal factors can increase NPP except TMAX and VPD. Most of the interannual relationship is strengthening, especially for thermal factor, indicating the strengthened impacts of hydrothermal factors and CO2, while the weakening relationship with hydrological factors accounted for large areas, which cannot be ignored. (2) With increasing elevation, the positive R NPP-CO2 diminished, while the positive R NPP-SM and the negative R NPP-VPD amplified, indicating the positive impacts from CO2 decreased, while those from SM and VPD increased.

Higher biogas yield with higher CH4 production and accumulation of acetic acid was observed more in the NZVI system followed by AP, CC, GAC, and Control operation. NZVI supplemented significantly added to biogas upgradation (7.6 L) with a concurrent CO2 decrease (87%) as compared to the GAC (3.868 L, 43%) and EM (AP, 4.89 L, 52%; CC, 4.73 L, 49%) but its sacrificial and oxidation nature offsets its translation potential.

Therefore, this paper simulates participants' behavior using evolutionary game theory, conducts stability analysis of equilibrium points of the replicator dynamic system using the Lyapunov first method, derives evolutionarily stable strategy combinations under different conditions, and finally performs simulation analysis using Matlab. The simulation results indicate: (1) By implementing reasonable incentive mechanisms, Local governments can encourage citizens to adopt low-carbon travel and community transformation.

This work illustrates the business of a livestock farm operated under environmental regulations, including cap-and-price, cap-and-trade, cap-and-offset, and carbon tax policies. Under a quantity-based all-units and prepayment scheme, the company buys a single kind of newborn-growing items from a supplier and sells them after slaughter when they have gained the desired weight via feeding. The whole targeted live weight is not consumable after slaughtering due to instant weight loss during bleeding and the removal of various non-edible components from the growing items. Incorporating this attribute, the current work derives sustainable inventory and pricing decisions for a livestock farm for the first time. Furthermore, the consumption rate of the edible components of growing items is adopted as a power form of both selling price per weight unit and storage duration. To determine whether a single or a series of prepayment installment strategies is more cost-effective for the company, important criteria are defined. Finally, several salient recommendations for the farm are extracted to not only gain economically but also preserve the environment by lowering its carbon footprint. When the carbon tariff rate is higher than the reward rate, the cap-and-trade policy outperforms the cap-and-price, cap-and-offset, and carbon tax mechanisms in terms of profit. However, both cap-and-trade and carbon tax regulations perform equally better than the cap-and-price and cap-and-offset regulations in terms of released emissions.

This research shows impact of renewable energy, government policy and incentives, forest area, green technological innovations, and renewable energy investment on ecological footprints in the Asia Pacific, with a specific focus on how various aspects of the shift towards a sustainable economy. The elasticity coefficient of environmental performance and public support was negative, a 1% increase in the EPI caused 0.166% drop in the ecological footprint. The ecological footprint shrinks by 0.019% for 1% rise in investment in renewable energy infrastructure. The ecological footprint shrinks by 0.795% for 1% rise in government policy and incentives. The ecological footprint shrinks by 0.518% for 1% increase in green technological innovation. The ecological footprint shrinks by 0.734% for 1% rise in renewable energy use. An increase in forest area of 1% is linked to a decrease in the ecological footprint of 0.016%. It is suggested to adopt a comprehensive and coordinated approach that involves multiple actors and factors at different levels to improve environmental sustainability. Policy should monitor and evaluate the impacts and outcomes of the interventions to improve environmental sustainability. These countries must first carry out substantial structural reforms in an environmentally responsible manner, need to implement measures aimed at decreasing emissions into their plans for economic growth to ensure the long-term sustainability of the environment and the economy. Furthermore, and most they must drastically move away from its main reliance on non-renewable energy sources and raise the percentage in its place of renewable energy. As a result, the nation must greatly boost its energy sector investments, especially in the expansion of the renewable energy. The government should instead reallocate funds to the construction of renewable energy-powered power facilities. These nations must offer financial rewards to encourage the development of new technology. So, this study highlights the importance of fostering environmental awareness, enhancing government policies and incentives, and investing in energy storage capacity to accelerate the transition to a green economy in the region.

BCLG is based on the lattice oxygen transference between a solid oxygen carrier and the biofuel to energetically support the biomass gasification. This process produces low tar and nitrogen-free syngas under autothermal conditions, and at the same time includes an intrinsic separation of carbon compounds from nitrogen in air, avoiding future carbon capture costs. This work evaluates the syngas production from pine forest residue (PFR) through the BCLG process with ilmenite as the oxygen carrier. The effects of several key operating variables, including temperature, oxygen-to-biomass ratio and mean residence time of solids, on the performance of the BCLG process were analyzed at 20 kWth scale. The syngas yield depended on the oxygen-to-biomass ratio and improved with the char conversion in the fuel reactor. Temperature and mean residence time of solids in the fuel reactor were identified as the primary factors affecting char conversion. A dedicated study was performed to assess the impact of the biomass size on char conversion, as well as the relevance of a carbon stripper unit on the improvement on char gasification due to its role either as a secondary gasifier or as a char-oxygen carrier separator. Higher char conversion values were achieved with the lowest biomass particle size (1–2 mm vs. pellets 6 mm Ø) due to lower restrictions to gas diffusion inside the particles. The carbon stripper may act as a secondary gasifier, thus improving the char conversion, but it was not able to take away the unconverted char particles from ilmenite in any case due to it was designed for powdered fuels. Besides, the generation of light hydrocarbons was hardly affected by any operating variables. The tar content remained below 4.5 g/kg dry biomass. The ilmenite showed a good performance during the continuous operation without signs of defluidization.";"2024-01-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623045924";"10";"Emissions Other

Not only the storage capacity is limited, but also the use of the ecological environment causes great damage, a serious threat to human life safety. Microalgae biodiesel receives extensive attention due to its biodegradable and carbon-neutral green energy characteristics, which is used to reduce or replace the use of these fossil fuels. Because of the slow growth of microalgae, low lipid content and low biodiesel production, people begin to study ways to improve the growth and lipid production of microalgae and catalytic conversion of biodiesel. In this paper, the research progress of the whole process from microalgae culture to microalgae oil production to microalgae catalytic conversion of biodiesel in recent years is reviewed. The efficient growth and oil production of microalgae, the catalytic conversion methods of microalgae biodiesel and the application prospects of microalgae biodiesel are discussed and summarized. Specifically, this review critically discusses: (i) The current development status of microalgae culture and microalgae biodiesel; (ii) Cultivation methods for efficient growth and oil production of microalgae under different stress conditions; (iii) The effects of different types of catalysts and catalytic methods on the yield of biodiesel; (iv) Environmental problems and economic value of the whole process of microalgae biodiesel production; (v) Current limitations and future research directions in the field of microalgae biodiesel. Studies show that regulating light, temperature, pH, nutrients, etc. can improve the growth and oil production of microalgae, in which the addition of anions and cations can change the physiological, biochemical and metabolic mechanisms of microalgae. At present, a large number of genetic modification and metabolic regulation engineering technologies are applied to microalgae oil production. They have precise control of the targeting mechanism in cells to induce increased lipid accumulation. The two-stage culture model can simultaneously increase biomass and lipid content. The addition of homogeneous, heterogeneous, biological enzymes and nano-catalysts accelerates the conversion efficiency and improves the yield of biodiesel. The catalytic yield of several magnetic nano-catalysts studied is as high as > 98 %. The supercritical method and ionic liquid method are favored by everyone because they do not use catalysts to reduce environmental pollution. In situ transesterification replaces the traditional two-step transesterification method to reduce energy consumption and cumbersome steps. Hydrothermal liquefaction method can directly convert wet algae biomass into biofuels without drying at high temperatures and pressure and in the presence of water. However, the current high-cost economic problems in the production of microalgae biodiesel and the environmental problems caused by the addition of catalysts need to further study the efficient and low-cost microalgae culture methods and new environmentally friendly catalysts and catalytic methods to improve the yield of microalgae biodiesel, to realize the commercial production of microalgae biodiesel as soon as possible.

In the PCC mode, hydrogen was introduced into the pre-chamber (PC) to generate distributed reacting jets, with a small energy fraction of 0.5%. The case featuring a slightly narrower PC throat (diameter of 5.4 mm) yielded the highest indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) of 50.4%, owing to the rapid distribution of reacting jets and advanced combustion phasing. Further increase in hydrogen energy fraction and reduction in throat diameter resulted in a lower ITE because of the enhanced wall heat transfer loss. The DF−CI mode also exhibited significant potential for achieving high efficiency. Through a systemic optimization of parameters such as diesel injection timing, spray included angle, injection pressure, swirl ratio, and piston shape, a significantly enhanced ITE of 50.3% was attained, 7.2% higher than the baseline scenario. The improvement was primarily attributed to the promoted mixing of diesel with air. Among the design parameters, the swirl ratio and spray included angle exhibited the most significant impact on the engine performance. Overall, both the PCC and DF−CI modes were found to yield high ITE and low ammonia emissions. However, because 20% of the diesel energy fraction was utilized to mitigate ammonia slip in the DF−CI mode, notably higher greenhouse gas emissions (carbon dioxide of 96 g/kW-h) were generated than in the PCC mode. In this regard, the ammonia-hydrogen PCC mode should be a more promising solution to achieve zero-carbon emissions for future ammonia engines.

Energy management, especially for critical infrastructure buildings and public buildings, often serves as an example of sustainable practices since it tries to increase energy resilience through backup power systems. These structures were dealing with more difficulties, such as tight budgets, complicated regulations, behavioral issues, and others. Managing energy consumption in buildings is a multifaceted undertaking that entails grappling with non-uniform energy usage and a lack of established design guidelines for implementing energy-efficient and sustainable solutions. Consequently, analyzing energy utilization trends in public buildings and projecting future energy requirements is of paramount importance. This comprehension is indispensable to the identification and acknowledgment of energy consumption patterns in commercial and institutional buildings. Our research is highly significant for optimizing energy usage, reducing environmental impact, and making informed decisions in building management. We emphasize the importance of our predictive capabilities, sustainability, and life cycle assessment (LCA) techniques in achieving these objectives. Our hybrid model improves energy efficiency while also making a significant contribution to the larger objective of meeting sustainability standards in the built environment through thorough analyses of real-world data. The goal of this study is to determine the most sensible classification and forecasting scheme for the energy usage rates of public structures. The goal of this study is to determine the most sensible classification and forecasting scheme for the energy usage rates of public structures. In order to determine the number of energy consumption pattern clusters, a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) model was utilized in conjunction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The determination of clustering levels for each structure was executed by utilizing K-means in conjunction with a Genetic algorithm (GA). This approach enabled the identification of optimal clustering levels for the given structures, thereby facilitating effective analysis and interpretation of the data. The GA was specifically employed to determine the optimal centroid points for each cluster, thus optimizing the performance of the fitting model. Cluster analysis pattern extraction has made determining which buildings consume the most energy easier. As intelligent models for predicting energy usage, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and CNNs paired with a GA have also been used. The application of a GA to modify multiple settings of a CNN was conducted at this stage. The CNN model using a GA shows the method that was used provides higher accuracy and standard error compared to the conventional approach. It achieves a 94.01% accuracy on the training dataset and a 93.74% accuracy on the validation dataset with an error rate of 0.24 and 0.26 respectively. On the training dataset, the accuracy is 89.03% with a standard error of 0.3, whereas on the validation dataset, the accuracy is 88.91% with a 0.33 standard error.

As a reference, PDI-IS with isopropylamine (IS) terminal alkyl substitution was synthesized simultaneously. Their photocatalytic performance to decompose phenol and tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) were investigated. PDI-SE could degrade 79.3% of phenol or 68.4% of TBBPA within 4 h under visible light. The degradation products of TBBPA were tracked using high-resolution mass spectrometry. The morphology, composition, structure, and optoelectronic properties of two photocatalysts, particularly their transient absorption spectra and fluorescence lifetime were studied. We also conducted theoretical calculations on their binding energy with phenol or TBBPA, distribution and separation of electron and hole of excited state PDI-SE and PDI-IS supramolecules. Due to the formation of hydrogen bonds the binding energy of PDI-SE with phenol or TBBPA is 1.24 eV or 1.99 eV, which is stronger than that of PDI-IS (0.85 eV or 1.66 eV). Although both PDI-SE and PDI-IS can form free radical cations in excited states, the high separation of electrons and holes of PDI-SE leads to a longer lifetime of free radical cations, so caused its excellent photocatalytic activity compared to PDI-IS. This article proposes a new strategy based on molecular design to promote efficient separation of photogenerated electrons and holes, thereby forming stronger oxidizing PDI cationic radicals in situ to enhance the photocatalytic performance of PDI supramolecules.

The enhanced thermolyses of CF and ECF were further realized in the presence of CO2. Catalytic pyrolyses over Co/SiO2 were also done to further promote their thermal decomposition. The enhanced mechanistic functionality of CO2 imparted by the catalytic capability of Co/SiO2 directly led to additional syngas formation (up to 50 %).

However, higher quality diets are not inherently of lower environmental impact. This paper examines the association between diet quality, defined using the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, Mediterranean (MED) diet and Healthy Eating Index 2015 (HEI-2015) , and environmental impacts among middle- to older-aged adults. The cross-sectional analysis used a random sample of 1862 males and females aged 46–73 years. Diet quality scores (DQS) were derived from a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). The impact of food production was estimated using greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) and blue water use (BWU) environmental impact indicators from secondary data sources. Relationships between food groups, DQS and environmental impacts were evaluated via correlation and regression analyses. The food group red meat & offal was found to be the largest contributor to dietary GHGE and caffeinated beverages to BWU for all DQS and across all quartiles of adherence. The cumulative contribution of discretionary foods and beverages requires attention given they are superfluous to human health. In fully adjusted regression analyses, higher diet quality was associated with lower GHGE for all DQS. Conversely, higher diet quality was positively associated with water use (DASH and MED only). Encompassing principles of the DASH and MED diets in future dietary recommendations may reduce diet-related disease in later life and dietary GHGE. However, the increase of BWU as diets become healthier is a concern. Advocating for plant-based diets must be coordinated with sustainable production and supply. National solutions to increase self-sufficiency and reduce impacts and reliance on climate vulnerable countries is warranted.

These emissions eventually result in dry and wet acid depositions due to atmospheric circulation. This infiltration of acidic elements alters the chemical properties of water systems, thereby deteriorating ground stability. The economically developed soft clay areas face considerable threats from these acid environmental attacks. This study focused on employing a ''one-part'' geopolymer (OPG) comprising ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS), fly ash (FA), and solid sodium hydroxide (NH) to stabilize the soft clay. Simultaneously, the deterioration behavior of OPG stabilized soft clay under two different acids (HNO3 and H2SO4) with various pH values (pH of 2, 4, and 6) and varied immersion periods up to 240 days was evaluated including the mass loss, neutralization depth (ND), pH value, and unconfined compressive strength (UCS). Additionally, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray energy spectrometry (EDS) characterized the evolution of microstructure and hydrate composition of OPG-stabilized soft clay post varied acid immersion. The results highlighted the superior acid resistance of the stabilized soft clay with an 80:20 GGBFS/FA ratio compared to other ratios. The presence of significant hydration products, such as calcium silicate hydrates (C–S–H), calcium aluminate (aluminosilicate) hydrates (C-A-(S)–H), and sodium aluminosilicate hydrates (N-A-S-H), was observed in the OPG stabilized soft clay. In addition, the contents of Si in the OPG played a significant role in enhancing the acid resistance of the OPG stabilized soft clay.

However, the NGH production also faces several significant environmental challenges that need to be addressed such as seawater intrusion, methane leakage, and submarine landslides. Therefore, an environmental-benign method to enhance hydrate production in clayey silty reservoir via splitting grouting was introduced. As a novel method for achieving the two goals of both reservoir skeleton reinforcement and permeability enhancement, is proposed to stimulate NGH reservoir. Herein, the formulation based on foamed ultrafine cement-based grout was established. The results showed that the grout has good fluidity with initial viscosity ∼500 mPa·s and consolidation time in the range of 28–50 min. Meanwhile, the consolidation performance evaluation was studied, and it showed that the consolidation is with porosity in the range of 9.41%–46.59%, permeability in the range of 51.23 mD-789.07 mD, and compressive strength in the range of 3.31 MPa–3.88 MPa.

However, single-factor assessments and traditional ecological footprint models limit the ability to compare ecological security across prefectures, and existing studies neglected renewable resources in the ecological security regulation strategies. This study constructed TRB's ecological footprint accounts, analyzed the status of the sustainable development of the watershed in combination with the landscape ecological risk index, and explored the strategies and feasibility of watershed ecological security regulation based on multi-objective planning and multi-scenario simulation. The results are as follows: 1) the ecological deficit of the basin has expanded by approximately 1.79 times since the beginning of 21st century, with the eastern part of the basin being at higher ecological risk. Overall, the annual decrease in per capita ecological carrying capacity was 0.85%, while the annual increase in per capita ecological footprint was 32.35%. 2) Fossil energy dominates the inter-annual variation in the ecological footprint of the watershed; its contributions to the total ecological footprint significantly increased from 9.55% to 71%. 3) On the basis of increasing crop yields and optimizing cropping structure, fully utilizing solar energy resources, increasing cultivated land by 15% or reducing fossil energy by 50% will improve the ecological security of the watershed. This study represents an important supplement to ecological security assessments of inland river basins in extreme arid regions, such as the TRB, and provides insights into ecological security regulation and sustainable socioeconomic development in such regions.

However, due to the binder's viscoelastic nature, the fatigue life varies with temperature, leading to a challenge in determining the LAS testing temperature. This research primarily addressed inaccurate assumptions of a linear relationship between the logarithms of the storage modulus ( log G ′ ( ω ) ) and angular frequency (log ( ω ) ), as well as intermediate testing temperature. Then, by performing the LAS test at four different temperatures on rejuvenated RAP binders, a method for determining the rejuvenated RAP binder's fatigue behavior was introduced. The results demonstrated that LAS parameters, including A and B, correlated linearly at various temperatures with the rejuvenated RAP binder's complex modulus (|G*|) calculated at corresponding temperatures. Therefore, a fatigue life model, considering strain level and temperature effects, was developed using a power function of |G*|. It was found that the residual analysis exhibited a lack of fit, indicating that the linear model was inadequate throughout the whole range of experimental frequencies at multiple temperatures. Moreover, the newly introduced model predicted fatigue life more accurately at various temperatures utilizing the maximum stress failure criterion and the 35% damage level. This model will allow the LAS procedure to be used in a wider range of temperatures and strain levels for which rejuvenated RAP binders are used in the flexible pavement.

This paper explores a novel supply chain network design problem considering capacity sharing with third-party manufacturers. Specifically, the problem involves location choices for owned manufacturing plants and distribution centers and the selection of third-party manufacturers. Third-party manufactured products can only be shipped to distribution centers, whereas products from plants can be shipped directly or through distribution centers to customer zones. In this network, customer demand and the product prices of third-party manufacturers are assumed to be uncertain. To address uncertainties, we formulate a distributionally robust chance-constrained model for the problem. The probability distributions of the uncertainties are characterized using Wasserstein ambiguity sets. The incorporation of chance constraints serves to enhance the level of satisfactory customer demand. To ensure tractability, we reformulate the distributionally robust model as a solvable model employing duality theory.

Waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs), which contain abundant metal elements such as Au, Ag, Cu, Al, Fe, and rare earth metals, have garnered widespread attention regarding the recycling challenges. In the absence of policy guidance and feasible technological advancements, WPCBs are typically disposed of through landfilling or incineration. However, WPCBs not only encompass economically valuable metals that can be extracted and processed but also harbor significant amounts of heavy metals and harmful substances that pose severe threats to both human health and environment. Therefore, the clean recycling of WPCBs is pivotal for fostering sustainable development in our society. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the treatment methods for WPCBs. Firstly, the resource and environmental threat posed by WPCBs is introduced to illustrate the urgency of WPCBs recovery. Subsequently, the approaches for pre-treatment and pre-concentration of WPCBs recovery are described, along with an elaboration on their potential for development. The pre-treatment methods primarily involve crushing and grinding, while pre-concentration mainly utilizes physical techniques such as gravity separation and flotation based on particle density and surface properties.

To recover these resources simultaneously and efficiently, a resource-saving process for co-smelting SACs and WPCBs was proposed using Cu from WPCBs to collect PGMs, Au, and Ag. Mechanical activation was found to enhance PGMs recovery by 5-10% by disrupting the cordierite encapsulation structure, thus exposing the PGMs. Additionally, gases generated during co-smelting efficiently reduced PGMs oxides and sulfides.

A multiple distributed activation energy model (M-DAEM) was applied to illustrate the potential multiple reactions over the thermal decomposition process. The introduction of copper species into WPCBs reduced the initial activation energies, resulting in lower decomposition temperatures.

While metal-based semiconductors are widely considered as promising photocatalysts to remove pollutants through AOP systems, their low light absorption efficiency and poor processibility remain major issues to be utilized for a sustainable AOP system with low energy consumption. However, the organic dye, erythrosine, which can generate singlet oxygens by absorbing visible light, is considered an excellent substitute for metal-based photocatalysts for cheap renewable AOP systems. Accordingly, we here demonstrate a new hybrid membrane, wherein erythrosine molecules are embedded into films of polydimethylsiloxane. The polymeric networks therefore play an important role in enhancing the thermal stability and light absorption efficiency of dye molecules upon hybridization. In addition, the foamed structures of films to enhance their porosity and oxygen permeability are introduced via the fast evaporation of ethanol. As a result, the photocatalytic performance of dyes is significantly reinforced as the porosity of the membrane increases, which is proven by analyzing the degradation efficiency of 1,3–diphenylisobenzofuran with the presence of foamed and hybridized films. The photocatalytic ability of the formed hybrid films was well regenerated in three repeated recycles. Moreover, an optical parametric oscillator (OPO) laser system was used to successfully demonstrate that the singlet oxygen generated from the optimized hybrid film was well diffused into the surface of polymer matrix. Accordingly, the film could effectively sterilize S. aureus and E. coli in an aqueous solution. Therefore, this study suggests that the hybridization of polymer and dye without chemical modification can be an effective strategy to fabricate cheap and reusable porous membranes for a practical environment purification system.

However, as a typical phosphorus containing material, InP scrap recycling is difficult and dangerous because phosphorus is flammable and releasing toxic and irritating smoke during combustion. In this study, a safe, clean, and sustainable “controlled-pressure pyrolysis–spray condensation” process is proposed. Firstly, InP is decomposed into phosphorus and indium under high-temperature conditions; phosphorus then evaporates into the vapor phase and is sprayed with warm water for condensation in water, whereas indium is enriched in the liquid phase. The feasibility of this process is proven by performing thermodynamic calculations and scaled-up experiments (hundred grams to kilograms) by using a self-designed equipment. At a decomposition temperature of 1323 K, micro-negative pressure, and holding time of 5 h, an indium ingot with a purity of 99.59 wt.% was obtained and the direct yield reached 98.2%. Industrial α-yellow phosphorus with a purity of >98 wt.% was obtained and safely stored in water, and the comprehensive recovery rate is >90%. The overall process produces zero waste gas, liquid, or residue. The new process is easy to implement in industrial applications when the equipment is fitted with a continuous feeding and discharging system.

Herein, we propose an electrochemical polishing method (SDEP) that employs solid dielectrics consisting of macroreticular ion exchange resin (MIER) solid particles and phosphoric acid electrolyte as an alternative to traditional liquid conductive media. Maintaining a polishing current of 0.4–0.5 A requires only an electrolyte consumption of 10–20 mL/h, leading to a more than 65% reduction in electrolyte usage compared to liquid electrochemical polishing. Meanwhile, this method can be applied to polish additively manufactured metal parts with an initial roughness Ra>10 μm. The achievable surface finish features Ra = 0.778 ± 0.078 μm, Rq = 0.960 ± 0.121 μm, and Rz = 4.175 ± 1.111 μm after 1-h polishing, with a material removal rate of 0.15–0.19 mm3/min.

Herein, we synthesized manganese zinc ferrite (MnxZFO) photocatalysts with spin polarization effect by doping Mn cation into ferromagnetic semiconductor ZnFe2O4 (ZFO). X-ray diffraction (XRD) characterization confirmed the successful preparation of ZFO and gradient Mn doping MnxZFO samples. In addition, the vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) results of Mn0.6ZFO displayed a stronger magnetization property than ZFO, which was beneficial for the modulation via a magnet. In photodegradation experiments, Mn0.6ZFO exhibited a remarkable enhancement of about 30% for tetracycline (TC) removal with an external magnet. The improvement of TC photodegradation efficiency by Mn0.6ZFO and a magnetic field could be attributed to the spin polarization of materials.

Additionally, the generated findings can be fine-tuned through consideration of the specified system size of the grid, thereby improving the identification of geographically suitable sites more effectively. The proposed methodology lies in the incorporation of five distinct approaches. The primary approach employs the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm to ascertain the most suitable bus bars and sizes for three Photovoltaic Distributed Generation (PV-DG), with a focus on minimizing power loss within Aden's electric grid. The second approach involves utilizing the Analytic Hierarchy Process-Weighted Linear Combination (AHP-WLC) method in conjunction with Geographic information systems (GIS) to accurately select appropriate PV sites. The third approach is an initial design to eliminate small geolocations that do not align with the PV system's size. Fourthly, the Least Costly Path Model (LCPM) is harnessed to choose a single geolocation. The final approach is dedicated to performing techno-economic analysis. The key findings reveal that the optimal bus bars are located at 30, 46, and 64 in the grid, with a total injected active power of 26 MW. Simultaneously, the identified optimal geolocations cover areas of 0.88, 0.48, and 1.37 km^2 for each bus bar, respectively. In the comparative analysis, the utilization of the proposed criterion involving optimal bus bars results in a larger geographical coverage (97.99 km 2 ) compared to the traditional criterion (76.28 km 2 ). Furthermore, the techno-economic evaluation indicates the viability of implementing PV systems in Aden. The authors have a strong conviction that the framework and outcomes of this study will garner significant attention and prove valuable in assisting decision-makers to improve the planning of grid-connected solar photovoltaic systems.

Under this framework, replacing certain components in the facility to extend the service life of the power plant is viewed, in some cases, as a feasible strategy. However, despite its enormous strategic interest for the solar PV industry, we find that revamping PV installations has been the focus of very few scientific publications, and even less so when it comes to analyzing real facilities. Thus, this paper performs a techno-economic analysis of three revamping strategies at a real PV power plant located in the south-east of Spain. The strategies consist of substituting, in each case, the PV modules, the inverter, and both components. The simulated results show that the highest production value by installed power is obtained when both the modules and the inverter are replaced. In the same vein, the economic analysis reveals this scenario as the most favorable in terms of profitability. Based on the results obtained, an interesting future line of research would be focused on the extension of the analysis at country level to study the joint impact of numerous revamping actions.";"2024-03-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624008874";"2";"Semiconductors"

However, the complexity of synthesis methods and the high costs of photocatalysts remain major challenges for the industrial application of this technology. The high content of α-Fe2O3 metal semiconductors in red mud (RM) presents an opportunity for the effective preparation of RM-based α-Fe2O3 composites for catalytic degradation. Graphitic-phase carbon nitride features a similar energy band structure to α-Fe2O3 and demonstrates excellent photocatalytic properties. Herein, we directly prepared a novel Z-scheme-heterojunction g-C3N4/RM composites via a one-step calcination method by reconstructing the interface between RM and melamine. Comprehensive characterisations revealed the formation of a Z-scheme heterojunction between g-C3N4 and α-Fe2O3. This significantly improved the spatial separation of photogenerated carriers, enabling the efficient degradation of formaldehyde. The degradation efficiency reached 63.04% after 2 h of light exposure, and the composites exhibited excellent recyclability. The optical adsorption and photocatalytic properties of this newly developed composite material were significantly enhanced compared with pristine RM, which degraded 26.96% of formaldehyde under similar conditions.

Using social network analysis methods and dependence indicators, this study constructs a Polycrystalline Silicon Trade Dependency Network (PSTDN) from 1995 to 2019, and performs descriptive statistical analysis and trade community divisions on the network. The Temporal Exponential Random Graph Model (TERGM) is used to explore the factors influencing the formation of trade dependencies. Based on the cascading failure model, a Photovoltaic Multilayer Network Supply Risk Propagation Model (PMNSRPM) is constructed to study the risk propagation process of polycrystalline silicon supply interruption as a raw material in the photovoltaic industry. Finally, using the risk propagation range and dependency degree, the study measures the importance of nations comparatively. The results show that (1) the PSTDN exhibits reciprocity, geographical clustering, and weak network convergence; (2) the evolution of the PSTDN's community has gone through three stages: the rising expansion phase from 1995 to 2007, the crisis recession phase from 2008 to 2010, and the competitive contraction phase from 2010 to 2019; (3) the evolution of the PSTDN shows strong reciprocity effects, transitive effects, stabilization effects, and lag effects as endogenous mechanisms; (4) the average risk propagation range is continuously increasing along the supply chain, while there is no significant difference in the risk propagation rate along the supply chain. The risk propagation rate of different risk sources shows a long-tail effect, with the risk propagation rate of leading countries like the United States and China growing rapidly over time. The United States can infect China, but China cannot infect the United States and Western Europe; (5) The risk propagation range and the dependency degree present a positive correlation ranging between 0.5 and 0.7, which is not as highly positive as initially anticipated, and the correlation between them shows a downward trend. This study explores the statistical characteristics of the PSTDN, community evolution, and evolutionary factors, demonstrates the importance of polycrystalline silicon supply security for the production of the photovoltaic industry, quantifies the risk propagation capabilities of different countries, and identifies a group of countries that actually have a high risk propagation range but tend to be underestimated due to their low dependency degree in normal trade network.

Photocatalytic water splitting (PWS) employing powdered semiconductors has enormous opportunity for sustainable fuel, since this crossroad connecting biological, material science, and physical sciences depicts a field with exciting multidisciplinary issues. Development in PWS has been accomplished in past decades, encompassing from basic science investigation to innovative extensible technologies. Semiconductor-based photocatalysis is regarded as a potential sustainable solution. In this regard, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is classed as a metal-free photocatalyst to overcome this energy demand and ecological challenges, because of its superior electronic structure with band energy of around 2.7 eV, strong photochemical stabilization, and higher light efficiency. The photocatalytic activity of g-C3N4 is inadequate, because of its small surface area (SA) and high rate of charge recombination. Various chemical alteration techniques have been developed to address such problems, broaden the functionality ranges, and improve the characteristics of g-C3N4. The present review provides an in-depth evaluation of the chemical modification techniques for g-C3N4, comprising covalently and non-covalently techniques. Covalent techniques demonstrate the formation of chemical bonding among the g-C3N4 configuration and the chemical activator via oxidation/carboxylation, amidation, composite inoculation, etc., even though non-covalent techniques entail the formation of physiological bonds and interfacial properties via van der Waals connections, hydrophobic forces, etc. After these fabrication approaches, the photocatalytic performance increased due to the generation of photoinduced electrons and holes, improved light absorption ability, and boosted SA, which provides more space for photocatalytic reaction. In this review, various metals, non-metals, metals oxide, sulfides, and ferrites have been integrated with g-C3N4 to form mono, bimetallic, heterojunction, Z-scheme, and S-scheme-based materials for boosting the photocatalytic performance. Also, different varieties of g–C3N4–based materials have been utilized for different aspects of photocatalytic applications such as water reduction (HER), water oxidation (OER), and overall water splitting (OWS). Therefore, we have assembled a summary of the latest modern g-C3N4 nanocomposites, as well as their uses in solar energy adaptation and environmental management.

The variation in required food intake was highly province-specific; however, in general, there was a need to reduce the intake of meat, grains, and edible oils and increase the intake of vegetables, fruits, legumes, tubers, and dairy products. Our findings highlight the importance of province-specific diet optimization, which can greatly improve acceptance and feasibility of sustainable dietary transition, guide individuals to change their food consumption behavior, and inform policymakers towards regionally tailored food policies.

Among these, the construction industry sector certainly requires special attention to promote sustainable and more circular actions. Moreover, the so-called green transition is considered the same as an additional European goal, namely that of the digital transition. The research presented in this article falls precisely within these two fields of study. It illustrates the process and methodological approach developed to produce a new panel for use in construction. This panel is made with Hemp-Pla, where hemp comes from the residues of threshing leaves, and is printed with additive technology. The achievement of the final result has required the elaboration of six prototypes, differentiated from each other according to the geometry of the section, the thickness, and the infill. The development of several prototypes made it possible to identify the main printing difficulties and the time and amount of material required. Based on the knowledge gained during the printing process of these prototypes and the analyses aimed at knowing their main thermal performance, it was possible to design and create a commercial-scale panel. Its energy performance values are comparable to panels already made from traditional materials. In addition, the Life Cycle Assessment showed that the results obtained are auspicious for bringing the printed panels made from Hemp-Pla to the construction industry market.";"2024-08-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624023175";"4";"Waste Other"

Framing the current debate on sustainability and digitalisation";"A significant weight on the environment is created by the agricultural processes starting from the exploitation of the soil and production to the physical distribution of goods, the retailers' operations and consumption. Agriculture and particularly agri-food is imperative to contribute to solving such global challenges as climate change and food security through cleaner and greener supply chains, where the implementation of smart technologies is one of the major ways to create an impact. The pairing between the potential of digital technologies and sustainability inputs, called twin transition, is currently one of the EU policy's priorities. This research focuses on linking digitalisation and sustainability in the agri-food sector through applications of various digital technologies and the associated contributions to sustainability through the three – environmental, economic, and social - dimensions. To analyse the current debate on sustainability and digitalisation, we have utilised a systematic literature review and qualitative analysis of (policy) documents. The discussion presents a conceptual framework, which follows the process of the integration of a digital technology from its reasoning to the associated sustainability outcomes. The research identifies uneven representation of digital technologies and the structural imbalance of applications towards farming as the agri-food supply chain node and farmers as the major actors' group. The scale of these applications frame the associated contributions to the sustainability dimensions. The analysis of the sustainability outcomes brought by digitalisation through classification of their aspects can advise not only a choice of technology but also managerial and policy directions leading to the transformation. One of the ways to manage twin transition and support competitiveness on both firm and sector levels is development of a strategy, which can be supported by policy making.";"2024-05-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624015117";"20";"Waste Other"

Success in these efforts depends on robust policy frameworks, effective stakeholder participation, and the availability of agricultural products to customers. This study introduces a conceptual and operational structure for the incorporation and management of an agricultural supply chain with a low-carbon scheme through the establishment of a collaborative market environment involving farmers, agricultural enterprises, and consumers. Within this framework, agricultural enterprises and farmers engage in a cooperative Nash game to determine the extent to which they are willing to employ low-carbon practices in response to collaborative market prices and government policies, including subsidies and carbon taxes. The Nash game yields a unique Nash equilibrium, suggesting the possibility of cooperative negotiations among the parties with the goal of improving their financial gains. The proposed model is applied in two Brazilian sugarcane supply chain case studies, integrating with traditional biorefinery mills to produce and market ethanol as a gasoline alternative. Our results suggest that (1) successfully allocating government subsidies and taxes motivates low-carbon adoption; (2) the government taxation policy stabilizes the low-carbon supply chain, improving stakeholder market pricing and consumer affordability; and (3) reduced cost gaps between low-carbon and non-low-carbon alternatives increase low-carbon adoption. As a result, this study provides fresh insights on the Nash collaboration of stakeholders in accordance with government policies to create a cleaner and more affordable agricultural supply chain market.

These fires pose economic, environmental, and social threats to the country. A primary cause of rural fires is the burning of biomass to clear agroforestry residues. Thus, combating rural fires requires more effective forest management, particularly the removal of forest residues that serve as fuel. These residues, also known as biomass, have significant potential for energy production and biofuel use. This paper proposes a model that integrates the PROMETHEE decision-making method with the roadmapping. This proposed model includes 7 steps, including the planning of the roadmap, the definition of the decision problem, gathering information and building the roadmap. The proposed model was applied to develop a roadmap proposal for the recovery of surplus agroforestry biomass in Portugal, identifying the most emerging conversion technologies in the national context. With the roadmap developed, it was possible to understand that the recovery of surplus agroforestry biomass in Portugal involves several sectors. The energy sector is one of those that can benefit from the recovery of leftover agroforestry biomass, both from the point of view of carbon neutrality and energy independence. Forestry management is another of the great advantages of recovering leftover forestry biomass and, consequently, reducing the number of fires. In the context of recovery, combustion is the most widely used technology for producing energy or heat. The technology identified as most emerging in the upcoming years is gasification. Investment in scientific research is essential for the success of this sector, as is the development of public incentive policies and more engagement from all stakeholders. This paper conclude that valorizing agroforestry residues can reduce rural fire risks while promoting energy independence, sustainable regional development, and innovation in Portugal.";"2024-03-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624007546";"8";"Waste Other"

In contrast, the framework of sufficiency explicitly calls to reduce and slow the cycle of production and consumption by ‘making do with less’. The fashion industry's manifestation of sufficiency is slow fashion, which embodies products that are made to last, and can be serviced to extend lifespan. While there is growing knowledge on slow fashion, there is a lack of empirical research on sustaining profitability in slow fashion. This study investigates the following: What are the profit contributors of UK slow fashion SME brands? We use semi-structured interviews with UK slow fashion SME brands to investigate novel practices that drive profitability. Findings include profit drivers related to product construction and design, collection size, rate of newness and lifespan, production and supply chain practices to suppress costs, product services to diversify and drive revenue, and consumers' values and behaviours.

Governments have incentivized companies to remanufacture discarded T&A products and subsidize them by enacting diverse policies, but these subsidies often lag behind upfront investments, and several TPRs in this industry often confront financial constraints and need to seek financing. Along this line, we have established a T&A remanufacturing supply chain that includes a well-funded Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), which manufactures and sells new T&A products, and a capital-constrained TPR, which is licensed by the OEM to remanufactures end-of-use T&A products. OEM financing and subsidy-based confirmation financing, are considered on top of the benchmark model without financing to the TPR. The results of the research show that initial operating capital level and unit remanufacturing cost are two key factors influencing the choice of TPR financing. When the initial operating capital shortfall is small, it is more advantageous for the TPR to cut down production accordingly by maxing out her in-house capital rather than to obtain loan from a well-funded OEM or bank. When TPR's unit remanufacturing cost is low, it is advisable for TPR to secure a loan from the bank (OEM) under moderate (low) capital shortfall. When the unit remanufacturing cost of TPR is moderate, OEM financing becomes a preferable option for the TPR if its capital shortfall is relatively large.

However, existing methods often involve multi-step processes, excessive material waste, or the use of environmentally harmful chemicals. This study introduces a novel cleaner method for fabricating hierarchical multi-scale surface textures via integrated ball-end and vibration-assisted milling. The proposed technique synergistically combines millimeter-scale texturing through ball-end milling with micrometer-scale texturing via vibration assistance, enabling the creation of complex, multi-scale surface structures in a one-step process. A custom-designed 2-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) flexible stage with a repeatability of ±0.1 μm was developed to precisely control two-direction vibrations during milling. Comprehensive modeling and experimental validation were conducted across various machining conditions and surface configurations. The results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves a 50% reduction in energy consumption and a great decrease in material waste compared to traditional texturing processes. Surfaces machined with two-direction vibration assistance exhibited the highest degree of precision, with chip adhesion reduced from 8.98% to 0.49% compared to non-vibration conditions. Contact angle measurements revealed that finer textures promoted increased hydrophilicity, with contact angles decreasing from 86.5° to 65.2° as groove pitch reduced from 400 μm to 200 μm under two-direction vibration. This innovative approach offers significant advancements in sustainable manufacturing techniques for functional surfaces, providing a cleaner, more efficient alternative to conventional multi-step texturing methods.

The collaborative execution of tasks through the sharing of production resources such as facilities and labor can effectively augment the utilization rate of end-of-life products. However, existing studies on scheduling problem in remanufacturing systems does not take into this issue. To fill this gap, this study considers an integrated scheduling problem in remanufacturing systems with parallel disassembly workstations, a flexible-shop-type reprocessing shop and a reassembly workstation, where the components obtained by disassembling can be outsourced within the time window given by the outsourcer. To address this issue, a mathematical model aiming at minimizing the completion time and total cost is established. Then, a knowledge guided artificial bee colony algorithm (KGABC) with a five-layer encoding scheme is proposed to solve it. In the KGABC, a two-step heuristic initialization approach is invented based on the characteristics of the disassembly and reprocessing stage. According to the problem-specific knowledge, a reprocessing advance scheduling approach is proposed to reduce idle time; an outsourcing assessment method is presented for determining the feasibility of outsourcing operation; a reassembly priority management strategy is put forward to determine the reassembly sequence of products. In addition, a knowledge guided search strategy is proposed in the onlooker bee phase to enhance the local search ability of the algorithm. Finally, the KGABC is subjected to comparative testing against the state-of-the-art algorithms on numerical benchmark instances with different scales.

The current study brings together two modern recycling techniques solvolysis and oxidative liquefaction to recycle five types of composite waste materials including wind turbine blades (WTBs), composite pipes, personal protective equipment (PPEs) used in the medical sector, photovoltaic (PV) panels and municipal solid waste (MSW). Following a well-structured experimental design for each type of waste the solvolysis was performed at a temperature range of 100–190 °C, process time within the range of 1–3 h, and catalyst (TBD) concentration within the range of 0.015–0.025 mol, end with ethylene glycol and 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone in a 1:1 M ratio, while depending on the material evaluated, the oxidative liquefaction process was conducted at temperatures between 250 and 350 °C for WTB and between 200 and 300 °C for PPE, MSW, and PV. Oxidant concentrations, reaction time and pressure (15–45%, 30–90 min, 20–40 bar for WTBs, 30–60%, 45 min, 30 bar for remaining waste types) were studied in addition to highly variant waste-to-liquid ratio from 5 to 25% for WTB, 3–7% for PPE and MSW, and 12.5–37.5 for PV. Prior to experimental investigation, surface morphologies and chemical studies of the waste material were performed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared FT-IR spectroscopy, while after experimentation total polymer degradation (TPD) was calculated and liquid products were analysed through gas chromatography with flame ionisation detection (GC-FID). Following the solvolysis, 50–60% TPD was obtained, allowing for the recovery of glass fibres (GF) with average lengths of 50–60 mm and a maximum length of 650 mm.

This study employs game-theoretic models to examine the impact of government intervention and various contractual arrangements on the strategic decision-making of electronics manufacturers regarding recycling. Our findings reveal that: 1) the manufacturers' recycling intentions increase when tax rate is within certain range, as their recycling effort, under such a circumstance, contributes to improvements in their profitability; 2) when collaborating with a third-party collector (3 PR), the 3 PR may exhibit passive resistance by reducing recycling efforts upon detecting manufacturers' insufficient incentives for recycling. Intriguingly, the 3 PR will increase the price offered to consumers for recycled materials in order to stimulate greater quantities of recycling; (3) the different designs of recycling contracts can incentivize manufacturers to engage in recycling activities in various ways.

Consequently, Fe/AC is the material with the highest adsorption capacity for DBP in transformer oils up to now. Furthermore, the desorption activation energy of DBP on Fe/AC was 46.623 kJ/mol, 1.73 times higher than original AC. Ultimately, the adsorption mechanism was explained using the Hard-Soft-Acid-Base (HSAB) principle, which demonstrated a stronger interaction between hard base DBP and Fe/AC due to the hard acidic nature of Fe3+ and therefore a higher capture capacity of DBP by Fe/AC. The simplified preparation method and enhanced adsorption capacity of the modified Fe/AC make it an efficient and cost-effective approach to ensure reliable and sustained transformer operation, while also minimizing the generation of waste transformer oils.

The lack of appropriate and industrially established solutions for handling and reuse of PVDF after fulfilling its first purpose aggravates this environmental issue. The presented work outlines a novel approach for the upcycling of PVDF waste material by supercritical fluid decontamination of used PVDF and subsequent conversion into a value-added, highly porous PVDF-based material with an open-cell structure, a so-called aerogel, containing a well-defined pore morphology on the microscale. The work further shows that the synthesis of an aerogel from used PVDF tolerates impurities to a certain extent, for which the previous treatment does not necessarily have to render a material 100 % free of contaminations. As a result, a proof-of-concept is given for an industrially feasible process that is capable of upcycling a valuable high-performance polymer into a sophisticated porous material, thereby avoiding the release of potentially toxic fluorine compounds and opening a path towards a circular economy for contaminated PVDF.

However, it also contains valuable graphite resources that can be recycled and used as raw materials in industry. In this work, we aimed to enhance the efficient recovery of graphite by introducing ultrasonic waves into the flotation process. Particle size test, inductively coupled plasma (ICP), BET surface area, and other analytical techniques confirmed that ultrasound could promote particle dispersion, clean the surface of minerals, increase the porosity of the graphite surface, and thus strengthen the flotation performance. The results showed that after ultrasonic treatment for 30 min, the recovery rate of graphite increased from 86.22% to 96.24%, the fixed carbon content of tailings decreased from 26.99% to 9.68%, and the fixed carbon content (84.95%) was close to that of conventional flotation (85.32%). Compared with the traditional purification method, this strategy reduces the follow-up cleaning steps of tailings, simplifies the process, reduces the use of chemicals, and features strong market competitiveness and green environmental protection advantages. Additionally, the process is simple and low-cost and can be applied to the recycling of other waste graphite, with potential industrial application prospects.

The hydrothermal carbonization (HTC) is a promising technology for recovering valuable resources from wastes. However, there is a paucity of efficient approaches to predict and comprehend the agricultural waste HTC process. Machine learning modeling approaches have emerged as an important tool for simulating thermochemical reaction processes such as HTC. However, previous studies all limit to predicting products properties of single-component HTC, which are contrary to the complex composition of raw materials, and demonstrate poor generalization performance. Herein, the homogeneity graph data is employed to represent the HTC data with variable components. Then, based on graph encoder-decoder transformer method, a bi-directional prediction model is established to model the HTC process of agroforestry and livestock wastes. In the case of the forward prediction, the model can predict the composition and yield of hydrochar according to the given HTC conditions. The comparisons with the experimental data other than the training and validation datasets show that the prediction accuracy (R2) of ash, carbon and nitrogen contents of the hydrochar are 0.895, 0.908 and 0.840, respectively, which proves the good generalizability of the model. Moreover, owing to the embedding vector, which connects the reactant data with the product data in HTC, the model can also achieve backward prediction of HTC reaction conditions such as raw material composition and reaction temperature. Furthermore, by dimensionality reduction analysis of the embedding vector in the model, the similarity of any two HTC reactions can be quantified. The established HTC-graph neural network (GNN) model shows both high accuracy and good generalization ability in bi-directional prediction of HTC process. Based on the effectiveness of the proposed model and the given evaluation indexes, the corresponding HTC parameters can be determined, which greatly benefits to the resources saving and energy consumption reduction.

This study examines microplastic (MPS) presence and distribution in Bosten Lake and their interaction with microorganisms. We employed a Confocal Raman spectrometer to identify MPS types and 16S rRNA high-throughput sequencing to analyze microbial diversity and composition. In May, the lake's average microplastic concentration was 108.20 particles per liter (PCS/L), decreasing to 21.67 PCS/L by October. Transparent and yellow fibrous microplastics, predominantly 0.2–0.5 mm in size, were most common. Key microplastics in May included PEEK (27%), PMMA (25%), and PET (9%), while October saw a prevalence of PET (35%), PS (13%), and PA (9%). Higher microplastic concentrations correlated with reduced microbial diversity. In May, the high microplastic concentration group (MH) showed increased Planctomycetota, while in October, Patescibacteria and Bacteroidota rose significantly in the high plastic group (OH), known for microplastic degradation. MH also had a higher abundance of Cryptomycota compared to OH. Functional analysis indicated that MH had more genes related to bisphenol, benzene, and chlorine compounds, whereas OH had genes linked to methane, nitrogen, and organic matter degradation. Microplastic concentrations peaked near the lake inlet and tourist areas, affecting microbial quantity, diversity, structure, and function.

Waterborne epoxy resin modified emulsified asphalt (WEREA) was then prepared for the application of a tack coat material. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) test was conducted to explore the possible reactions between the compositions. A rheology test, direct tension test, pull-off bonding test, and oblique shear test were also conducted. Results indicated that in the FTIR test, a new peak around 1732 cm−1 was formed due to the reaction between the carboxyl functional group in WER and the amino group in curing agent to form an ester bond. The incorporation of WER led to an elevation in the complex modulus and a simultaneous reduction in the phase angle of WEREA. When the temperature was larger than 60 °C, the phase angle showed a decreased trend, indicating the material became less viscous due to the increased temperature, illustrating thermosetting characteristics of epoxy resin. As the content of waterborne epoxy resin (WER) increased, there was an observed decrease in the direct tensile rate, coupled with a concurrent increase in direct tensile strength. When the ratio of emulsified asphalt and WER was 1:0.6, the tensile strength of WEREA increased by 811% in contrast to the specimen without the inclusion of WER. There existed different optimal WER contents for the pull-off strength tests conducted on different substrates. For asphalt concrete substrate and steel slab substrate, the optimum ratio of emulsified asphalt to WER + curing agent was 1:0.4, and 1:0.8 was the optimum ratio for the cement concrete substrate. When the ratio between emulsified asphalt and the combination of WER along with the curing agent was 1:0.4 (WEREA-4), the oblique shear strength obtained the maximum value, which was increased by 18.7% in contrast to WEREA-0.

Therefore, alongside restrictions on the use of highly soluble agrochemicals and enhanced application guidelines, there is a significant demand for low-impact and cost-effective solutions aimed at reducing the mobility of agrochemicals in the soils. This study evaluates the potential of soil amendments—commonly used to enhance soil structural properties, water holding capacity, and fertility—to also absorb highly soluble pesticides, thereby controlling their leaching into the subsoil. Specifically, zeolite, biochar, and milled corncob were examined in laboratory tests under static (batch tests) and dynamic (column leaching tests) conditions to assess their effectiveness in adsorbing two widely used pesticides, copper sulphate and dicamba. Batch adsorption tests were performed using the amendments as pure materials and in mixtures with sand at various application rates (1–20% by weight). The highest affinity to copper sulphate was recorded for biochar, while dicamba exhibited a higher affinity to corncob, thanks to its higher content of organic carbon. Column leaching tests, performed at an amendment application rate of 5%, confirmed the different affinity observed in batch tests among pesticides and amended soil. Less than 2% of copper sulphate leached out from biochar- and zeolite-sand columns, while a recovery of 10% and 56% was observed for the corncob-sand mixture and for pure sand, respectively. Dicamba leaching from biochar- and corncob-sand columns was halved compared to pure sand. In conclusion, the tested soil amendments resulted highly effective in reducing pesticide leaching, opening the way for their possible applications in agriculture to reduce or prevent both diffuse and punctual contamination.

To align with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 6: Clean Water and Sanitation and 13: Climate Action by mitigating the massive water and climate impacts induced by the common practice of fertilizer crops using direct land application of poultry manure, the framework minimizes freshwater eutrophication (FE) impact and climate change impact (GWP). To account for the circular economy, the net present value (NPV) is maximized to measure the economic feasibility of implementing alternative management pathways. A multi-objective mixed-integer non-linear programming framework accounts for the selection of direct land application, and waste to energy technologies, spatial variation in manure supply, facility sizing, and the products’ consumption and end-of-life. This optimization framework is evaluated for a case study in New York state. Under an attributional life cycle optimization, anaerobic digestion minimizes FE with an impact of 0.002 kg P-eq/ton manure, while using a consequential life cycle optimization, hydrothermal carbonization minimizes FE with an impact of −0.96 kg P-eq/ton manure. For both life cycle methodologies, pyrolysis with land application of biochar minimizes GWP. At the attributional life cycle assessment tradeoff point for GWP and NPV, minimum carbon credits of US$33/ton CO2-eq are necessary for a pyrolysis plant to have a positive NPV, implying that harnessing economies of scale or robust carbon accounting is necessary for the widespread adoption of pyrolysis as a poultry manure management technology.

The scarcity of electron acceptors and the low activity of functional microbes are limiting factors which are overcome by the soil microbial electrochemical system (MES). Using the petroleum hydrocarbon polluted soils as substrates, soil MESs were constructed with four different water-sealed levels to optimize the system configuration. After 65 days of operation, the accumulated charge of the group with the lowest water level (MES0) was 1282 C, while that of the highest water level group (MES5) was only 151 C. Compared with the original soil (OS), the hydrocarbon removal near the anode and cathode in MES0 were 28%–30%, which were 4%–11% higher than those in MES5. Additionally, the co-occurrence networks analysis revealed dominance in positive than negative links among bacterial, fungal, and archaeal communities in MES0 compared to MES5 and OS. In MES0 bacteria were more densely populated and connected into more closely related groups with higher interactions than those in MES5 as well as in OS. Contrary to bacteria, MES5 favored the growth and connections of fungal and archaeal communities compared to those in MES0. The above changes were ascribed to the dissolved oxygen, redox potential, and reduction of resistance, which shifted the electron acceptors hence contributing to the process of electrons and substrates transfer in soil, suggesting that bacteria synergistically cooperated with fungi, and archaea in the removal mechanisms of hydrocarbons in the MES.

Molecular dynamics simulations were employed to construct various bitumen models, including bitumen–bitumen (without water), water-containing single bitumen, water-containing bitumen–bitumen, and bitumen–water–bitumen models. The primary research objectives were as follows: comparing the changes in the densities of bitumen models with and without water, analyzing the interlayer cohesive energies of bitumen models interacting with water, evaluating the hydrogen bonds in water-containing bitumen models, and characterizing the diffusion behaviors of bitumen components. The results indicated that when water interacted with the bitumen, it filled internal voids, leading to an overall increase in volume and reduction in density. The interaction energies between the rejuvenated bitumen models and water molecules decreased as the numbers of polar sites exposed to SBS molecules decreased. The numbers of hydrogen bonds between water molecules and rejuvenated bitumen models were similar to those in aged bitumen models. As the number of fractured SBS molecular chains gradually increased, the interlayer cohesive energy in the Methylene-bis(4-cyclohexylisocyanate) (HMDI)-rejuvenated bitumen model gradually increased. Water molecules significantly influenced the interactions at the rejuvenated bitumen–rejuvenated bitumen interface, weakening the cohesion characteristics between bitumen molecules.

Addressing the problems brought about by rapid urbanization to ensure urban safety and sustainable development has become particularly urgent and crucial, especially for regions with high ecological vulnerability and weak economic foundations. This study utilizes panel data spanning from 2013 to 2020 and applies the entropy weight-TOPSIS model to assess the urban resilience of 54 cities within the Yellow River Basin. It explores the temporal evolution, spatial distribution, and dynamics of urban resilience. Further, through the application of the Geographically and Temporally Weighted Regression model, the research investigates the drivers of urban resilience, considering temporal and spatial variations. Findings indicate a consistent increase in urban resilience across the Yellow River Basin, albeit with widening regional disparities. The spatial pattern of urban resilience exhibits a gradient decline from downstream to midstream and then upstream. The impact of various factors on urban resilience differs by region, with technological innovation emerging as the most influential. To foster a sustainable future, the Yellow River Basin should prioritize technological innovation, particularly in industrial cities, and advocate for the adoption of green technologies to diminish resource consumption and mitigate environmental pollution.

Firstly, the chemical characteristics, micro morphology and pore structure of aggregates were evaluated by XRF, SEM and MIP, respectively. The geometry characteristics of the connecting voids in the planting concrete were quantified based on CT data. Additionally, a mathematical model of water absorption and reversion was proposed. Finally, the plant growing environment of planting concrete with different aggregates was compared and the mechanisms were explained. The results suggested that the planting concrete with different types of aggregate reach similar pH value at 28d but differs in the geometry characteristics of the connecting voids. The porosity of aggregates influences the mechanical properties of the planting concrete and its water absorption and reversion ability. A higher porosity of pores above 100 nm in the aggregates results in greater initial water absorption rates, a higher saturation water absorption rates, and a stronger continuous water reversion ability. A higher porosity of pores below 100 nm in aggregates results in stronger continuous water absorption ability and higher residual water content.

To address this knowledge gap, the transport of non-flushable wipes with different densities was systematically studied in a circular pipe. The critical shear stress and flow velocity for the incipient motion of wipes were found to increase with increasing wipe density and with decreasing relative wipe size, starting from 0.02 Pa and 0.05 m/s, respectively. Non-dimensional equations were developed for characterizing the incipient motion using two parameters: the critical Shield number and particle Froude number. The mean wipe velocity, mean ambient flow velocity, and wipe density could be well described by a power relationship. The ratio of wipe velocity to local flow velocity increased with the increase of wipe vertical position in the pipe. Different movement modes of wipes were observed and classified by using the ambient cross-sectional average velocity U a : the sliding mode started first, followed by rolling/saltation at U a = 0.18 m/s and suspension at U a = 0.41 m/s. The threshold values for each mode were found to increase with increasing wipe density. Finally, the research results were applied in sewer management.

Improving natural ventilation is key for mitigating UHI effects. If policymakers lack foresight into the land-use changes, it may lead to uncontrolled expansion, threatening ventilation potential. Thus, focusing on land-use changes for urban planning goals, this study innovatively proposed the ventilation potential (VPT) simulation by 2030 under scenarios of business as usual (BAU), rapid urban sprawl (RUS), farmland preservation (FLP), and forest preservation (FTP). A model built on the random forest was used to simulate VPT under multiple scenarios. The results indicated that: (1) VPT was mainly influenced by roughness length and land surface temperature gradient, compared to forest canopy density, elevation variation coefficient, and slope. (2) The VPT in 2030 differed considerably between scenarios. Areas with high VPT exhibited a significant declining trend. Spatially, the Fen River and mountainous regions showed high VPT, while the VPT in the northern and southern plains was relatively low. (3) In the FLP scenario, the area with extremely low VPT increased by 476.83 km2 from 2020 to 2030, which was 2.7 times that of the 2010–2020 period. It has a high and extremely high VPT of 1063.82 km2, second to the FTP scenario. (4) In the FTP scenario, the area with high and extremely high VPT decreased by 70.43 km2 and 109.28 km2, from 2020 to 2030. It had the largest area of high and very high VPT among all scenarios, covering 1123.3 km2. The model supports data updating as well as provides scalability of the indicators. With the refinement of this model, the study is expected to offer spatial forecasting tools for urban planning, guiding the development of livable environments in rapidly urbanizing cities to cope with climate change.

Evidence from China ";" Over the past two decades, China has actively pursued a green, low-carbon economy in response to climate change. Amidst rapid economic development, China's green total factor productivity—a key metric reflecting the nation's green development—has notably risen. As a developing country with a population exceeding 1.4 billion, agriculture plays a key role in China. China has persistently strived to comprehensively promote the scale and scope of agricultural mechanization, recognizing it as a crucial gauge to enhance agricultural productivity, thereby facilitating agricultural modernization and ensuring food security. However, can elevating the agricultural mechanization level improve China's green development within the agricultural sector? Specifically, how does agricultural mechanization ( A M ) affect agricultural green total factor productivity ( A G T F P )? To address these questions, we assess the effects of agricultural mechanization on agricultural green total factor productivity and examine its channels using panel data from 30 provinces in China spanning from 2000 to 2021. Additionally, we investigate the heterogeneous effects under different levels of economic development, agricultural economic development, environmental regulation intensity, and agricultural technology. The results indicate that: First, the development of agricultural mechanization promotes the agricultural green total factor productivity. Second, channel analysis indicates that agricultural mechanization can bolster agricultural green total factor productivity through three channels: enhancing agricultural management level, improving agricultural factor efficiency, and fostering diversification of agricultural industrial structure. Third, heterogeneous analysis suggests that agricultural mechanization exerts a more pronounced impact on agricultural green total factor productivity in provinces characterized by lower levels of economic development, more backward agricultural economic development, higher environmental regulation intensity, and more advanced agricultural technology. This article is anticipated to furnish empirical evidence from China for developing nations seeking to foster agricultural green sustainable development through the widespread adoption of agricultural mechanization, thereby contributing significantly to global efforts to mitigate climate change.

Adopting the circular economy concept is essential to address this problem. This approach prioritizes reliability and re-manufacturability, aiming to simultaneously reduce waste and enhance sustainability and profitability. In this context, the proposed model introduces a sustainable closed-loop supply chain model wherein the manufacturer oversees the production process and delivers requested batches to the retailer under the single order and multi-shipment policy. The model incorporates the notion of circularity, quantified by a circularity index representing the degree to which the product's circularity level. The level of product circularity can be enhanced by material choice, supplier selection, and innovative design while manufacturing. The model being presented aims to maximize the total integrated profit of the closed-loop supply chain system by optimizing the number of shipments as well as the circularity index. It is evident from the analysis that the circularity index significantly influences profits and environmental sustainability by increasing product demand and extending product life cycles. Notably, the numerical example provided in the model illustrates that accounting for the effects of the circularity index results in an optimal profit up to 5% higher compared to scenarios where such effects are not considered.

Variations in location, type, and feedstock quality impose logistical and storage challenges. Such a dispersion and variety of biomass sources, as well as the dispersion of demand points, may undermine the economies of scale and increase the risk of supply shortage. By consolidating biomass preprocessing and distribution activities in bio-hub facilities, they can contribute to the overall resilience of biomass supply chains (BSCs) and ensure a more sustainable and cost-efficient approach to bioenergy production. As such, investigating the advantages and challenges associated with bio-hub implementation can offer invaluable insights on the efficiency and sustainability of BSCs. Despite its critical role, a major part of the literature on BSCs is confined to the decision-making processes related to biomass suppliers and bioconversion facilities. To bridge this research gap, the current study conducts a systematic literature review on bio-hub implementation within BSCs in the period of the last ten years. Shortlisted papers are classified and analyzed meticulously to extract possible improvements from BSC and modeling perspectives. From the BSC viewpoint, one notable gap is the little attention to mid-term and short-term decisions of bio-hub operations such as inventory control, resource management and production planning. Furthermore, the results revealed that environmental and social aspects of bio-hub implementation require considerable attention.

This urgency, coupled with the need for a holistic evaluation framework, sets the stage for this study. Motivated by the gaps in quantitatively assessing sustainability, the study aims to discern and quantify the sustainability efforts of leading automotive manufacturers. The objective is to establish a robust, quantifiable link between operational efficiency and sustainability criteria that informs both business strategy and environmental stewardship. To achieve this, an innovative methodology combining the Malmquist Data Envelopment Analysis (Malmquist DEA) framework and the Ordinal Priority Approach (OPA) is employed. The approach analyzes efficiency changes, technological progress, and the industry's adoption of sustainable practices over a five-year period, concluding in the pre-pandemic year of 2020. The findings reveal a notable emphasis on productivity and market exposure, identifying them as pivotal to sustainable manufacturing. The OPA provides a weighted analysis of sustainability criteria based on expert evaluations, emphasizing the integration of environmental initiatives with core business strategies. The study's contribution is twofold: it introduces a novel, quantifiable approach to evaluating sustainability in the automotive industry, and it offers strategic insights for companies seeking to elevate their sustainability profile effectively. However, the reliance on pre-pandemic data and expert opinions marks the limitations of the study, indicating the necessity for further research.

Industrial parks, as crucial economic hubs, require effective SCMPR strategies considering land, economy, and the environment, but present research seldom proposes methods that consider multiple factors and stakeholders together and fit for practical application. Given this, this study establishes a multi-factor industrial structural adjustment model for industrial parks incorporating scenario analysis to unveil optimal adjustment schemes and then develops an efficient spreadsheet tool based on the model. The model results convincingly fulfill SCMPR requirement after applying to a typical industrial park: After adjustments, 50 main industries in the park can achieve SCMPR targets, with carbon intensity and total phosphorous intensity predicted to achieve relative decoupling and other regular pollutant emissions anticipated to absolute decoupling by 2030. The proposed optimal scheme indicates that wastewater, waste gas, and solid waste volumes in the park will rise by 39%–54% by 2025 and 76%–113% from 2025 to 2030, and then translate into a 50% increase in waste treatment costs by 2025 and a subsequent 98% increase by 2030. The carbon intensity of the park will decrease from 154 tonnes of CO2 per million Chinese Yuan in 2020 to 94 in 2030. The results culminate in three strategic recommendations for industrial parks: (1) prioritize reducing total pollutant emissions and carbon intensity, (2) customize carbon mitigation and pollution reduction strategies for each industry, and (3) regulate material and energy flows at multiple levels.

By scrutinising cities’ mitigation actions in the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for the year 2019, the study encompasses data from over 800 local governments and over 3700 reported mitigation actions. Spanning a diverse range of cities with varying populations, global city status, and regional locations, the analysis aims to uncover cities’ sectoral focus and financial and implementation arrangements. It further explores whether there are significant differences between diverse cities and their reported actions. The analysis highlights the dominance of building and infrastructure among different cities’ reported mitigation actions and most cities having successful implementation and finance by largely relying on local sources. Notably, most cities demonstrate successful implementation and finance predominantly sourced locally. Surprisingly, no discernible variations were found in cities’ sectoral focus and financial and implementation arrangements based on their population and GDP per capita. However, cities with distinct global economic statuses exhibit notable differences in sectoral focus, even though no disparities exist in finance and implementation approaches. Global cities, in particular, show a higher percentage of actions related to building, energy, and transportation compared to non-global cities. Significant differences also emerge across regions, particularly in infrastructural sectors such as building, waste, and energy supply, as well as in the implementation and funding of actions. For instance, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and Oceania showcase the lowest percentage of actions in the building sector but the highest in waste, distinguishing them from other regions. These findings underscore the potential of smaller cities, with lower economic status and those lacking global city status in successfully funding and implementing their mitigation actions despite regional variations.

Despite its significance, the impact of tunnel construction, a commonly adopted human activity in railway development, on MNC and its underlying mechanisms remains underexplored. To address this gap, a field survey was conducted in shrubland ecosystems on the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Our study aimed to investigate the influence of tunnel construction on MNC and its contribution to SOC along an altitudinal gradient (3240 m, 3420 m, and 3600 m) and at two soil depths (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm). Results indicated that tunnel construction did not exert a significant impact on SOC and MNC. However, it led to a substantial decrease in the contribution of MNC to SOC (15.6%–19.9% in tunnel-affected areas) compared to the control areas (19.04%–30.97%). This outcome was likely attributed to the decreased bacterial necromass carbon (BNC) and the increased input of underground plant-derived carbon. MNC at 10–30 cm was significantly lower than that at 0–10 cm, and it exhibited a notable decrease at 3420 m compared to both 3240 m and 3600 m. These observations were closely related to reduced carbon input and microbial necromass stability. Principal component structural equation modeling revealed that soil microbial activities were the most important for MNC and SOC accumulation. Consequently, tunnel construction influenced SOC formation by altering the relative contributions from plant and microbial sources. This study provides valuable evidence for assessing the impacts of engineering construction on SOC and its sources in the context of climate change. Moreover, it offers scientific support for ecosystem conservation and sustainable development in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region during engineering construction.

Currently, waste ACs are mainly disposed of by landfill or incineration, which is not only a waste of potential resources but also a possible cause of secondary pollution to the environment. Thus, the regeneration of activated carbons seems a much better choice for waste ACs disposal. In this work, the deactivation mechanism of activated carbons during adsorption or catalysis (focusing on adsorption deactivation) was firstly interpreted then main regeneration methods, including thermal methods (thermal regeneration, microwave regeneration, etc) and non-thermal methods (chemical regeneration, electrochemical regeneration, ultrasonic regeneration, biological regeneration, etc). Subsequently, this paper introduces the regeneration devices used in some of the regeneration methods, and finally analyzes the application prospects and development trends of various regeneration methods at present and in the future.

A comprehensive understanding of the driving forces and their contributions to changes in cropland soil erosion provides solutions for effective mitigation strategies. The factors of embodied soil erosion changes have rarely been systematically described on the regional scale. We combined the Modified Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) with the multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model in the first step to analyze the flow of embodied cropland soil erosion in the trade network. The structural decomposition analysis (SDA) model was used to decompose the embodied cropland soil erosion into six driving factors: natural factor, human factor, and socio-economic activities. The SDA results reflect that the nature factor (8.0 % and 6.0 % in two periods from 2012 to 2017) and the final demand factor (17.3 % and 9.9 % in two periods from 2012 to 2017) facilitated the national cropland soil erosion increasing. The human factor and the economic production structure factor always reduced the growth of cropland soil erosion.

However, the understanding of how livestock production affects restoration effectiveness remains limited, impeding the advancement of sustainable grazing management. Taking the Loess Plateau as a case area, this study aims to examine the impacts of livestock production on key ecosystem services (ESs) under the Grain-to-Green Program (GTGP). Based on an improved estimation of available biomass for livestock, grazing intensity across the study area in 2015 was quantified. Then, by linking grazing intensity with associated livestock economies, a comprehensive framework reflecting livestock production was constructed to analyze its overall impacts on three ESs (water yield, erosion control, and forage provision). Finally, spatial effects of each component within livestock production on the ESs were discussed to inform grazing managements under the GTGP. The results indicated that the three ESs still suffered widespread negative impacts from grazing intensity, with 9.82% of the region experiencing high-level grazing in 2015. Although grazing had potential to mitigate water consumption due to vegetation growth, livestock density of most areas has exceeded its threshold (0.52 sheep or goat per ha, or 0.30 cattle per ha) for maintaining available water resource. Livestock economies demonstrated positive effects on the ESs to varying degrees. Nevertheless, as the positive externalities from ecological compensation are on the wane, challenges in livestock management have surfaced in both poverty-stricken and large livestock-intensive regions. This study offers insights into assessing regional grazing intensity, and enriches understanding of impacts of livestock production under vegetation restoration.

For alpine regions, safeguarding wetland carbon storage (WCS) has become an integral aspect of sustainable development. To explore the correlation between WCS and sustainable development, we predicted wetland patterns and WCS on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) for 2030 under four scenarios. Utilizing the spatial boundaries of protected areas (PAs), we evaluated current and future changes in the representation and effectiveness of WCS protection. Furthermore, a coupling coordination degree (CCD) model was used to identify the relationship between WCS protection and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The results showed that lakes and reservoirs/ponds were the largest and smallest wetland types on the QTP, respectively, and both displayed an increasing trend from 2000 to 2020, while other wetland types mostly exhibited an opposite trend. Scenario analysis revealed the largest increase in river area compared to 2020 under the comprehensive development scenario (CDS), reaching 6.88%. Across all scenarios, lakes would increase by approximately 6%, primarily due to distance to water and population density. The economic development scenario (EDS) experienced the greatest reduction in swamps. Under these four scenarios, compared to 2020, WCS hotspots displayed varying degrees of decline, with the ecological conservation scenario (ECS) experiencing the most significant reduction (4.2%) and the EDS experiencing the least reduction (0.14%). Only swamps and rivers conservation representation can be improved in 2030. For WCS outside PAs, the most significant enhancement was achieved under ECS for all wetlands except rivers. 6 classes of seriously, moderate, slight incoordination and barely, moderate, high coordination areas were detected based on the CCD analysis. Among the above zones, over 65% of prefecture-level municipalities on the QTP exhibited better than barely coordination levels in 2010, and by 2020, the figure had exceeded 69%. This study deepens understanding of the relationship between WCS and sustainable development in alpine plateaus, and provides decision-making support for coordinate regional development and wetland conservation.

However, the relationship between river DC and discharge during rainfall events in the vegetation restoration area remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate the evolving patterns of DC concentrations in rivers of small watersheds undergoing vegetation restoration on the Loess Plateau during rainfall events. It quantified the relationship between rainfall, floods, and river DC using high-frequency sampling, continuous hydrology, and climate monitoring, along with hysteresis analysis. Results indicated that disparities in carbon sources and previous hydrological conditions mainly influenced the trends and hysteresis patterns of river dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations. During intermittent rainfall, depletion of proximal DOC sources in preceding events led to scarcity in subsequent events, while activation of DIC sources replenished the river in subsequent events. Rainfall significantly affected river DC flux in the vegetation restoration watersheds. The output flux range for DOC and DIC was 0.37–9.12 kg/h and 2.21–39.95 kg/h, respectively. Thus, measures must be implemented to mitigate the additional carbon losses resulting from revegetation.

However, a knowledge gap remains in its evaluation from the perspective of systematic resource/element metabolic processes. To understand the urban resilience response mechanism better and depict metabolic processes systematically, an urban resilience assessment framework of “robustness-adaptability-restorability-coordination” based on the cross-media carbon metabolism network model was established. Principles of material flow analysis and ecological network analysis were applied to examine the urban resilience of Guangzhou, China, from 2010 to 2020. Results showed the urban resilience level decreased from a carbon metabolism perspective during the study period. This was reflected in an overall decline in system robustness and restorability, relatively unchanged adaptability, and a non-beneficial coordination relationship.

CdS@Gd-ZnO was able to degrade 99 % of rhodamine B (RhB) (10 mg/L, 75 min) and 95 % of methylene blue (MB) (10 mg/L, 60 min) under visible-light.

The pollutant source census in China serves as a fundamental undertaking in the study of pollution sources, providing crucial data for the analysis of pollution from domestic sources. This study employs pollution coefficients derived from China's two national pollution source surveys, integrating spatial autocorrelation and center-of-gravity shift analysis methods to investigate the national-scale spatial evolution characteristics of major urban domestic water pollutants, including BOD, TN, TP, and Oils. Furthermore, the impact of urbanization processes in population, economic, social, and spatial dimensions on urban domestic water pollution sources is explored using the multi-scale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) method. The results show that: (1) Urban domestic water pollution exhibits an east-high and west-low distribution pattern, with EHL being the primary region of pollution generation. Compared to 2007, the western region experienced a faster increase in BOD (30% increase), while the eastern region showed a sharper decline in TN (45% decrease) by 2017. (2) The results of spatial autocorrelation show that high-value clusters of urban domestic water pollution are located in the eastern China and around Chongqing, while low-value clusters are extensively distributed in the western region, indicating significant spatial heterogeneity in water pollution. (2) Based on center-of-gravity analysis, pollution displays a discernible migration trend from the northeast to the southwest, with the center located near the border of Henan and Hubei provinces, within the latitudinal and longitudinal range of 32°N–32.79°N and 113.09°E−113.85°E.

This study conducts a comprehensive analysis of water pollution complaints in Japan from 1989 to 2021, utilizing integrated datasets that include river networks, water quality monitoring stations, regional industrial demographics, and socioeconomic indicators. Our findings reveal a significant decline in complaints—over 45% from the peak in 2006—following the implementation of various environmental policies aimed at reducing industrial discharge and restoring natural ecosystem function. The shift in complaint targets from industries to individuals suggests that these policies have been effective in mitigating industrial pollution, while also highlighting the need to address individual behaviors that impact water quality. Despite long-term improvement in water quality indicators such as Suspended Solids (SS) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO), no significant correlation was observed between these indicators and the temporal or spatial patterns of water pollution complaints. Instead, a strong positive correlation was observed between complaints and reported water quality incidents, reflecting heightened public sensitivity to acute pollution events. Spatial analysis further identified a significant association between complaints and the manufacturing workforce, indicating that industrial activity continues to shape public perception of water pollution risks. Our findings underscore the complex interaction between public perception, environmental policies, and industrial activities, and suggest that effective water management requires a multifaceted approach. Policymakers should continue to enforce stringent industrial regulations, while also enhancing public education and communication strategies to improve awareness of individual responsibilities in water protection. This research provides a theoretical basis for developing more responsive and effective environmental policies and public education strategies.

To tackle this pressing issue, the Chinese government has issued a strategy of ""Basing four aspects on water resources"". The strategy aims to guide the scopes and scales of urban extension, land cultivation, population capacity, and economic production based on the constraints imposed by water availability, referred to as the Water-Urban-Land-Population-Production (WULPP) Nexus. While there is literature dealing with various water-related Nexus, few studies focus on WULPP Nexus. To understand the co-evolution and conflicts of WULPP Nexus between social development and water management, the study proposed a comprehensive framework and corresponding socio-hydrology model. The model integrates the WULPP Nexus with the macro-economic Input-Output model and a multi-objective optimization (MO) solution to comprehensively explore the dynamic interactions between water and social development from the perspective of water, land, labor, products, and capital. The proposed model was applied in Yinchuan (YC), a pilot city for Ecological Protection and High-quality Development in the Yellow River Basin, to examine its effectiveness and sensitiveness. The results reveal a strong positive correlation between population growth and socio-economic development, with urban expansion offering both benefits and trade-offs, while land cultivation presents the most significant trade-off with other objectives. Water availability, especially under consumption constraints, is crucial to improve outcomes in wet years and intensify trade-offs in dry ones. These findings underscore the importance of a balanced approach to social development and water management, offering valuable insights for sustainable development in water-scarce regions globally.

However, the impacts of drought and ecological water replenishment on water scarcity have been largely ignored, and there is a lack of systematic understanding of the linkages among water supply and demand, ecosystems and social systems. Using western Jilin Province, China, a typical semiarid area, as the study area, this study quantified water supply and demand and measured water scarcity under average, drought, and ecological water replenishment conditions from 2000 to 2020; built network structures among water supply–demand, ecosystems, and social systems; and predicted future changes in water scarcity risk from 2020 to 2040. The results revealed that drought decreased the water supply by approximately 27%, whereas ecological water replenishment increased the water supply by approximately 30%. Land use/land cover change had a small effect on the water supply (less than 3%) but a large effect on the water demand (approximately 16%–38%). Drought exacerbated water scarcity in 3.14%–10.93% of the region, whereas ecological water replenishment decreased water scarcity in 5.46%–6.31% of the region. Precipitation, population density, and gross domestic product were the important factors connecting water supply and demand, and the normalized difference vegetation index was always the key factor connecting water supply, demand, and supply–demand match. Droughts weakened, but ecological water replenishment strengthened the connections among water supply–demand, ecosystems and social systems. From 2020 to 2040, drought further exacerbated the scarcity risk, while water scarcity occurred under ecological water replenishment conditions. Ecological water replenishment needs to be strengthened, and it is necessary to consider the demands of different stakeholders to achieve win‒win results. This study can inform sustainable management strategies for agricultural production and water resources in arid areas.

This study coupled five high-resolution climate models from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) with the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT)-CERES-Maize model to quantify drought risk and the drivers affecting WUE in five major maize ecoregions of the Yellow River Basin (YRB) under three future scenarios (SSP126, SSP370, and SSP585) for both the historical baseline (1985–2014) and three future periods: 2021–2040 (2030s), 2041–2070 (2050s), and 2071–2100 (2080s). And a bias correction method was implemented for the crop model to analyze optimal WUE thresholds for maize across varying dry-wet gradients. The results indicated that future drought risk will likely persist in the YRB under all scenarios, but with regional differences in drought severity and frequency. The southwestern region (V) experienced the highest frequency of drought (62.50%-SSP126), while the northwestern region (III) exhibited the lowest frequency (33.00%-SSP585) in 2030s, and 83.30% of areas in the southwestern (V) showed significant wetting in the 2080s under SSP126. The bias-corrected CERES-Maize model effectively simulated crop yield and evapotranspiration (ET), resulting in an average reduction of 4.00% and 9.73% in normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) respectively. Distinct WUE thresholds ranging from 1.96 to 8.41 kg ha−1 mm−1 were observed across various scenarios-periods in the maize regions, mostly under slight and moderate dry/wet conditions. Notably, all SSP585 scenarios demonstrated a decrease in WUE thresholds compared to the baseline. Across all scenarios and periods, WUE was mainly driven by yield in the eastern regions (I and II) but by ET in the western regions (III, IV, and V). These findings suggest that regions experiencing varying degrees of drought severity should undergo differentiated management and optimization of agricultural practices to improve WUE under future climate scenarios.

This study selected Yanchi County as a typical area. First, the water footprint method is used to evaluate the water usage of food, cash, and feed crops in the region from 1990 to 2020. Then, the vector error correction model (VECM) is used to analyze the short-term effects and long-term effects of urbanization and planting structure on the water consumption of these three types of crops. The results show: 1) The total agricultural water footprint (WF) in Yanchi County, as well as the WFs of the predominantly grown food and feed crops, show an upward trend. Additionally, the proportion of blue WF is relatively high across all crop types. 2) Reducing the proportion of food crops will increase the WF of cash and feed crops, but it will not necessarily decrease the WF of food crops. 3) An increase in the level of urbanization may reduce the agricultural WF in the short term, but ultimately, it will lead to an increase in the WF. Overall, this study reveals the growing pressure on agricultural water use faced by the agro-pastoral ecotone during the processes of urbanization and planting structure transformation. It highlights the importance of developing rain-fed agriculture, seizing the technological development opportunities brought by urbanization, and reasonably adjusting the cropping structure for the sustainable use of water resources.

Traditional methods, such as agent-based models (ABM) and game theory (GT), have been applied separately to allocation problems but often fail to capture the dynamics of partial cooperation among stakeholders. This study addresses this gap by presenting a novel framework that integrates ABM and GT techniques—including the Shapley value (SV), least core (LC), weak least core (WLC), and proportional least core (PLC)—for conflict resolution and optimal water allocation. The integrated ABM-GT framework simulates real-world scenarios by modeling the dynamics of partial cooperation, where agents iteratively adjust their resource contributions over time based on outcomes. The ABM component captures the adaptive behaviors of agents, while the GT component provides mechanisms for the fair allocation of benefits. The framework is applied to a case study of the Roodbal basin in Fars province, Iran, which comprises four agricultural zones facing significant water management challenges due to droughts and legislative constraints. Results from a 15-year simulation demonstrate that the ABM-GT framework enhances stakeholder cooperation and responsiveness. Partial cooperation among farmer agents led to an increase in net benefits by up to 150% compared to non-cooperative scenarios during dry years, with the maximum net benefit reaching $211.53 million using the PLC method. Agents with higher economic potential were more responsive to incentives, while those with lower economic potential increased their cooperation in response to water shortages. Specifically, the overall average contribution to the coalition increased from 36% to 52% for zones 3 and 4 during periods of water scarcity.

However, achieving coordinated optimization of regulation stability and operational efficiency has been a long-standing challenge. This study proposes a new soft linking model to address the limitation that current scheduling methods fail to account for both efficiency and second-level stability simultaneously, aiming to improve the day-ahead scheduling strategies for PSP. Firstly, a Pumped-Storage Hydroelectric System (PSHS) model is developed to reflect the regulation stability of PSP, considering the transient characteristics of hydraulic, mechanical, and electrical subsystems. Then, by analyzing transient responses under various operating working conditions, the study integrates the transient variation laws of the power plant into a regulation stability dataset (RSD). Finally, using RSD as the coupling interface, with regulation stability and operational efficiency as the objective functions, a Pumped-Storage Power Day-ahead Scheduling (PSPDS) model is established. An actual PSP is used as a case study to evaluate the effects of four operational scenes with varying optimization objectives on operational efficiency and subsystem performance. The results indicate that controlling load change magnitude and increasing the load decrease working conditions effectively enhance the stability of PSP subsystems. In addition, although the proposed scheduling scheme increases water consumption by 0.0213% compared to traditional scheduling method, it improves regulation stability by at least 15.14%. The findings suggest that a minor compromise in operational efficiency can lead to a significant improvement in regulation stability.

Therefore, the Chinese central government launched the Environmental Comprehensive Administrative Enforcement Reform (ECAER) in 2018, characterized by the centralization of power and functions. However, the exact impact of ECAER on border water quality remains unclear. Utilizing the exogenous shock from ECAER and surface water quality data between July 2018 and December 2020, this study identifies the causal relationship between ECAER and border water quality. Using the staggered difference-in-differences approach, this study found that environmental centralization leads to a significant deterioration in border water quality. This influence is more prominent in regions with lower river classes and better historical water quality. Further analysis revealed that the deterioration in border water quality was mainly centered around the downstream stations, with no significant change in the upstream stations of the administrative boundary. This implies that local governments strategically respond to environmental centralization by polluting their neighbors. However, public attention to water pollution issues could mitigate the border water pollution effect of environmental centralization. This study provides valuable insight into the long-standing debate on the effectiveness of environmental (de)centralization and has policy implications for global water pollution control.

However, research remains lacking on the complex relationship between CW and UW from a water resources subdivision perspective. By constructing a heterogeneous trans-log stochastic frontier model, this study estimated the technical efficiency, output elasticity, and substitution elasticity; further, the study innovatively explored five development pathways for CW and UW. The results are as follows. First, China's overall technical efficiency demonstrated a fluctuating upward trend over the study period, which was significantly boosted by higher levels of research and development investment and an increased number of granted patents. Second, compared with UW, CW made a more substantial contribution to output. The output elasticity of CW demonstrated a “low in the center, high on the periphery” pattern, with the lowest elasticity areas clustered in the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River. Conversely, the output elasticity of UW followed a “high in the east and low in the west” pattern, which was similar to that of capital. Third, with 2012 as the turning point, CW and UW shifted from a substitution to a complementary relationship.

The grey water footprint (GWF) is a measure of the volume of freshwater required to assimilate the relative water pollutants resulted from N leaching-runoff processes. The responses of N cycling and associated regional GWF to crop production under different irrigation methods have not been investigated. In this study, the N leaching-runoff rate, N₂O, and NH₃ emissions in croplands and the associated GWF per unit crop yield (UGWF) and annual total GWF (TGWF) of winter wheat-summer maize crop rotations across the Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Region (HSHR) of China were simulated and evaluated at the prefecture level over the 2004–2020 period. Four irrigation scenarios were modelled: furrow, sprinkler, surface drip, and subsurface drip irrigation. The results showed significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in N leaching-runoff rates and emissions of N2O, and NH3. The N leaching-runoff rates for winter wheat and summer maize ranged from 3.9% to 10.9% and 15.0%–32.3%, respectively. With changing different irrigation methods, N leaching-runoff rates exhibited greater sensitivity than N₂O and NH₃ emissions; this sensitivity was more pronounced in winter wheat than in summer maize. Findings reveal that N pollution is influenced not only by irrigation methods but also by weather conditions, crop-specific rooting characteristics, sowing time, and soil texture. Winter wheat UGWF under the four irrigation methods mostly followed the order of furrow > sprinkler irrigation > surface drip irrigation > subsurface drip irrigation. Conversely, for summer maize, subsurface drip irrigation resulted in a higher UGWF compared to furrow irrigation, mainly due to increased water percolation thus higher N leaching-runoff rate in near-saturated soil with higher rainfall. This result reveals the potential conflict between water-saving irrigation and N pollution control.

Spectral monitoring data from 721 aquatic DOMs in inland China were collected to predict and quantify the spectral properties of aquatic DOMs and the coupled effects of human activities and environmental factors by complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN), random forest (RF) and structural equation modeling (SEM). Our results show that the dataset is relatively evenly distributed in terms of flow regimes, and the data are adequately representative of various types of water in China. Although the performance of CEEMDAN is affected by the skewed distribution of data sampling points (453 and 449 for eastern regions and eutrophic waters, respectively), CEEMDAN effectively processes the spatial sequences of aquatic DOM spectra, which significantly improves the reliability of the machine learning model (by 13%–68%) and reduces the error (by 63%–92%).

Compared with the business-as-usual scenario, the optimized schemes enhance agricultural benefits, saving 13.3 billion m3 of water over the entire planning period. Meanwhile, sustainable energy implementation would yield potential carbon emission reduction benefits of around 2.8 billion CNY. In summary, the proposed method would successfully provide a paradigm for the synergetic decision-making of WEFN systems.

As a significant hydrological phenomenon, flooding has been shown to influence algal physiology and ecology. However, its effects on the spatiotemporal dynamics of diatom communities in plateau floodplains remain poorly understood. This study explored diatom community assembly mechanisms and co-occurrence network complexity driven by flooding in the Tibetan Plateau floodplain. Planktonic and benthic diatom data from two hydrological periods (normal and high-water period) were analyzed. We observed that flooding altered diatom community composition, notable increase in transient planktonic diatom diversity and a decrease in benthic diatom diversity. Flooding also affected the deterministic–stochastic equilibrium in diatom community assembly, mainly by promoting diatom dispersal. Deterministic processes were present in the normal period (planktonic diatom community: NST = 36.4%; benthic diatom community: NST = 24.9%), whereas stochastic processes were enhanced during the high-water period (planktonic diatom community: NST = 80.5%; benthic diatom community: NST = 59.3%). Additionally, the co-occurrence network analysis reveals that under normal period, the network comprises 82 nodes and 226 edges. However, during high-water period, the number of nodes and edges decreases to 43 and 61, respectively. Flooding decreased species interactions among diatoms, resulting in lower network complexity and community structure stability. The present study reveals the role of flooding in diatom community assembly and ecology in a plateau floodplain.

This study proposes a coupled ecosystem service and multi-scenario land-use change simulation model designed to investigate the future dynamics of water-carbon-land coupled systems in the Hanjiang River Basin (HJRB), the primary objective is to provide valuable insights that can inform strategic spatial management decisions, aligning with the ambitious objectives outlined in COP 27. Specifically, this study utilized the PLUS model, InVEST model, and redundancy analysis to comprehensively analyze the interplay between ecosystem services and land-use changes, with a specific focus on water, carbon, and land dynamics. The results showed that regardless of the simulated scenarios, there was a consistent pattern observed in the changes of land use types within the HJRB, with a decrease in farmland and an increase in forest. However, the water area showed an increasing trend in all scenarios, especially in the ecological land protection (ELP) and sustainable development scenarios. Furthermore, the ELP scenario effectively suppressed the expansion of building land and the erosion of ecological land. Ecosystem services under different scenarios showed similar spatial distribution patterns but presented varying degrees of change related to the impact of future land use and urban development on ecosystem services. The water yield (WY), carbon storage, and soil conservation in the upstream areas increased to varying degrees, while those in the downstream areas decreased. In conclusion, precipitation, land use/land cover change, DEM (Digital Elevation Model), and NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were the main driving factors affecting ecosystem services, with precipitation having the most significant and enduring impact on WY. This study supports the adoption of targeted spatial management measures to promote sustainable development and enhance human well-being.

An empirical study of 31 provinces between 2011 and 2021 ";" The interaction between water resources and industrial development remains inadequately comprehended in China. This study aims to explore the influence of water resources on industrial structure and its underlying mechanisms. The study establishes a theoretical mechanism framework based on the resource curse and blessing theory, examines the influence of water endowment on industrial structure, and investigates its influencing mechanism by using panel data from 31 provinces in China between 2011 and 2021. The study finds that, between 2011 and 2021, the national water-industry coordination gradually increased and remained uncoordinated. Water endowment and industrial structure exhibit a U-shaped relationship with spatial spillover effects. Water endowment reverses the industrial structure in water-scarce regions, while it promotes it in water-abundant regions. Both the curse and blessing of water resources are identified in China, and 30 provinces are “cursed”. The water-industry coordination plays a moderating role in the influence of water endowment on industrial structure, mitigating the effects of both the water resource curse and blessing. It expands the range of influence of the reverse effect and can shift the water resource curse to the water resource blessing. It is therefore proposed to employ water resources as an effective instrument to facilitate regional industrial upgrading, reinforce advanced agglomeration industry system, promote industrial structure adaptation to water resources, and strengthen the implementation of “Determining Industry on Water”. The paper illustrates the different water-industry interactions in water-scarce and water-abundant regions and the role of water-industry coordination in transforming the resource curse into the resource blessing.

Numerous studies have been conducted to investigate the way to achieve a higher displacement efficiency. However, these studies often assumed that the pore space was initially saturated by oil only, ignoring the effect of initial oil distribution on the remediation, which led to incorrectly computed flow field and biased analysis. This work aimed to reveal the effect of initial oil distribution on flow physics during the remediation. Based on a pore-scale model and the phase-field method, the spilled oil invasion and remediation in a heterogeneous porous media were investigated, and the dynamic evolution of the phase interface was examined in particular. Four different distribution patterns of spilled oil were obtained through various velocities during the oil invasion stage, which were considered as initial states for the subsequent remediation stage. The results showed that ignoring the oil invasion process led to a more than 10% reduction in the ultimate remediation efficiency. However, the maximum interfacial area of fluids was larger and the obtained relative permeability curve was much smoother for the scenario considering the oil invasion. Besides, a higher initial water saturation led to a lower starting pressure. This work provided new pore-scale insights into the often-overlooked roles of initial phase distribution in fluid dynamics behind the remediation of oil-contaminated soil by water injection, which was of fundamental importance to the development of effective response strategy for soil contamination.

However, there has been limited research on the effect of climate change on future rainwater resources, particularly for large-scale water diversion projects. Based on global climate model data, future land use data and SCS-CN (soil conservation service curve number) model, this study proposed a calculation method of rainwater resources under different SSP scenarios in the future period, and carried out a case study on the cities in the receiving area of South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP).

However, according to future projections, the quantity of rainwater resources in the study area decreases from south to north. The spatial distribution of rainwater resources demonstrates a nearly normal distribution in the eastern and western routes and a bimodal distribution in the Central Route Project (CRP). In the context of global climate change, the increase in rainfall resources in the CRP may be beneficial for the establishment and implementation of the SNWDP. This study can provide a reference for analysing the uncertainty of rainwater resources in the future period under climate change.

In a context of tighter restrictions on the use of synthetic plant protection products at the regulatory level, wineries are looking for alternative methods to control diseases, making the application of ozonated water an option to consider. To determine the environmental sustainability of this alternative vineyard disease control treatment, an environmental impact assessment was conducted using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methodology. The assessment was carried out in a vineyard located in the D.O. Rías Baixas of Galicia, located in northwestern Spain. The analysis was conducted on the basis of two functional units: i) 1 kg of grapes and ii) 1 ha of land managed and using a cradle-to-gate boundary system. Ten impact categories were assessed using the ReCiPe method, except for the water scarcity indicator, which was quantified using AWARE. The environmental sustainability of the vineyard was further analyzed by measuring its carbon sequestration potential to obtain a more complete environmental profile. The RothC-26.3 model was chosen to estimate absolute carbon sequestration and annual sequestration rate from 2020 to 2040. Since the ozone-only scenarios lost all harvest, no environmental assessment was performed for such scenarios. For the remaining scenarios, the findings suggest that those using a combination of ozonated water and fungicides have the worst environmental performance due to notable reductions in grape yield and more frequent disease control interventions, particularly in certain scenarios. When evaluating environmental performance per hectare of land managed, the scenario using ozonated water with a limited number of disease control interventions exhibited the most favorable environmental profile, primarily due to reduced use of fungicides and disease control passes. In addition, the main contributors to the vineyard environmental profile identified were diesel fuel combustion during field operations, fertilizer use and production, and irrigation. In addition, the research indicates that the vineyard sequesters carbon annually, but this alone is insufficient to offset its greenhouse gas emissions. However, it is estimated that through the application of more appropriate soil management practices, the vineyard could achieve carbon neutrality and potentially increase soil carbon stocks over time.";"2024-11-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624034486";"3";"Water Other"

Liquid–liquid emulsion is a typical existence form of water and oil pollutants. The relative stable flow field is a necessary condition to separate the emulsion, while turbulence of the flow field is required for homogeneous mixing. For centuries, stirring-induced turbulent flow has been used for mixing, with a limited number of separation cases achieved by the stable part of the container at low Reynolds numbers (Re). In this study, the separation of liquid–liquid emulsions in a fully turbulent system for Reynolds number values above 10,000 was observed for the first time. Besides the turbulent flow influenced by the stirring speed, the additional dispersed phase, which was the same as the emulsified dispersed phase, played a critical role in the separation performance. The turbidity of oil-in-water emulsion could be decreased to less than 5 NTU (nephelometric turbidity unit) from 500 NTU under the optimal conditions in this study, with a separation efficiency of over 99%.

Traditional curing methods, such as water curing and plastic film curing, have significant limitations, including high water consumption and environmental pollution. This study introduces Microbial Induced Carbonate Precipitation (MICP) as an innovative, environmentally friendly curing method for ready-mixed concrete, addressing the urgent need for sustainable construction practices. The feasibility of MICP surface curing is investigated through comprehensive mechanical and durability tests, coupled with microscopic analyses to understand the underlying mechanisms. The results demonstrate that MICP curing substantially enhances concrete performance. Compared to traditional water curing, the samples cured using MICP have increased compressive strength and splitting tensile strength by up to 31.69% and 24.66%, respectively. Additionally, MICP surface curing significantly reduced capillary water absorption, electric flux, and chloride ion migration coefficient by 12.83%, 15.50%, and 17.36%, respectively. It is found that the optimal concentration of Ca2+ in the MICP solution initially improves concrete performance, which then diminishes at higher concentrations due to bacterial activity inhibition. Spraying the MICP solution at appropriate intervals and increasing the number of treatments further improved concrete properties by ensuring a more extensive and dense deposition of CaCO3. Microscopic analyses, including XRD, TG, and SEM-EDS, revealed that MICP surface curing leads to the formation of vaterite and calcite, which densely cover and fill microscopic cracks and pores, ensuring adequate hydration and simultaneously enhancing the concrete's mechanical and durability properties. This study concludes that MICP surface curing provides superior performance than traditional methods and offers a more sustainable and environmentally friendly curing method.

It assesses the social cost of environmental impacts compared to actual prices. This study also evaluates substitutability among water, labor, and capital in the three scenarios for developing relevant agricultural policies depending on distinct agricultural conditions. Social costs tend to be underestimated because they are not directly observed. Our society has faced an overproduction of agriculture in terms of CO2 emissions and the exploitation of water. This study employs a method of a directional technology distance function for global agricultural production based on Food and Agriculture Organization data on agricultural inputs and outputs. The following three critical findings were obtained: First, the average shadow price of water under the economic scenario was close to the current actual water prices, and water prices would increase if agricultural production accomplished the three SDGs (Goal 2, 6, and 13). Second, labor is substituted for water under the environmental scenario because water prices increase rapidly. In contrast, water is complementary to labor under the SDGs scenario, implying that labor becomes more important for increasing food production. Third, the current CO2 prices are lower than those in the economic scenario. These values are significantly lower than those under the SDGs and environmental scenarios. Based on these results, we conclude that agricultural products are often undervalued because the appropriate value of water is overlooked in real markets.

The trend of farmland expansion is to expand to surrounding areas on the basis of existing farmland. The overall center of gravity of cultivated land in the watershed is moving from northwest to southeast, mainly towards the water source area. The IWBEI index is more prominent in identifying cultivated land and wetlands in arid regions. According to IWBEI's calculations, the priority order of land types is: forest > cultivated land > wetland > water > snow > grassland > impermeable surface > bare land.

The paper extends previous research and understanding into this threefold phenomenon by exploring the integrated policy needs within the Australian setting. This is achieved through comparative case studies involving assessments of farm dam policies and their integration, and on-site audit-style surveys of dam management practices that are related to the policies in two state jurisdictions, South Australia and Tasmania. These case studies represent weak versus strong farm dam safety, equity and land-use regulatory policies and integration. Survey results in South Australia find most hazardous farm dams studied are not built or maintained to an adequate standard and spillways are blocked and/or under-designed. This results in potentially storing more water than entitled and creating unsafe dams and potential water sharing equity and land-use planning threats at both the individual and cumulative levels in catchments. Survey results in Tasmania are in contrast and hence this state serves as an exemplar of feasible 3-fold integrated policy that is performing effectively. Analysis of results against international regulatory benchmarks finds that in addition to Tasmania's model there are other regulatory options that may better suit different jurisdictions, and cost-effective tools to help integrated policy implementation are also available. Based on these findings policy recommendations for South Australia are made.

Existing impact assessments are limited by the duration and resolution of water quality data, while long-term impacts and contributions of climate and socioeconomic drivers have rarely been quantified. In this study, we utilized remote sensing imagery to obtain high spatiotemporal resolution data and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to reveal how the comprehensive impacts vary over time. We obtained Trophic State Index (TSI) data between 2000 and 2022 from remote sensing imagery. XAI was employed to elucidate the intricate connections between TSI and the multifaceted factors that encompass climate and socioeconomic dynamics. Six typical lakes in East China were selected for this study. Results showed that the TSI of these lakes had generally decreased over the past two decades, being typically higher in the littoral zones compared to the center. Moreover, higher temperatures increased lake TSI. Meanwhile, higher rainfall increased TSI through increased lake nutrient inputs from surrounding watersheds where agricultural and industrial activities are intensive. It was also found that economic development impacts on lake TSI shifted around 2013. Economic development caused severe negative effects on lake water quality before 2013, while this phenomenon decreased thereafter. This is attributed to the implementation of a series of green transformation policies in the region.

Among other things, the originality of such consists of the joint consideration of sustainability, operational, and reputational issues, forging the link between measuring the use of natural resources and preserving companies' intangible capital. More specifically, through two scenario-based behavioural experiments with a total sample of 252 consumers in the UK, we analyse how information regarding the use of water (i.e., water footprint) affects firms' reputation (i.e., trust, attitude towards the firm, word-of-mouth, brand avoidance). We also investigate consumers' perceptions when companies seek to (1) increase the transparency of their consumption of natural capital (i.e., a conceptual proxy for the adoption of natural capital accounting) and (2) rationalize this consumption (i.e., a goal aligned with the objectives of natural capital accounting). The method employed is adequate as it allows the detection and measurement of respondents' perceptions of specific issues presented in the different scenarios. The choice of the UK as the setting reflects the importance of the country in the fashion industry, as it has a solid consumer base and is home to several international fashion brands. The supply chain management scope refers to the link between water consumption (which often takes place in the production of raw materials (e.g., cotton) and in transformation processes (e.g., fabric dyeing, tanning) by suppliers), fashion brands' reputation, and consumers' perceptions, with the joint consideration of these four phases sustaining the delimitation. Building on the premises of the resource-based view and signalling theory, the study is contextualized in the fashion industry as its current production levels require a significant consumption of natural resources, particularly water. Results show that, while the publication of the water footprint may damage companies’ reputations, initiatives aimed at increasing transparency and reducing environmental impact can reverse these losses to a large extent.

However, the construction of reservoirs inevitably leads to ecological and environmental issues, especially the release of low-temperature water in summer and its detrimental effects on fish spawning and reproduction. These issues can be alleviated by optimizing the reservoir operation scheme, but the large amount of time required for predicting the reservoir outflow temperature emerges as the primary constraint. In this study, we considered Pubugou (PBG) Reservoir and proposed an efficient and high-precision prediction method for reservoir outflow temperature based on theory-guided machine learning (TGML) algorithms. This method was applied to the multi-objective optimization of the reservoir operations, and an optimization operation plan was proposed to improve the outflow temperature. The research results indicate that the LightGBM machine learning model shows good predictive performance, with a maximum deviation of no more than 1 °C in predicting the outflow temperature. There is a significant competitive relationship between reservoir power generation and the outflow temperature. Compared with the current operational scheme, the maximum power operation plan results in a 4.4% increase in total power generation but causes the average outflow temperature during the fish spawning period to decrease by 0.1 °C. The total power generation of the improved outflow temperature operation scheme was 0.8% lower than that of the actual scheme, but the average outflow temperature during fish spawning increased by 0.2 °C. Properly increasing the discharge flow from the reservoir and lowering the water level can thus help alleviate the issue of outflow temperature.

This study develops a factorial multi-region input-output CNN-LSTM (FMCL) model through integrating deep learning (convolutional neural network and long short-term memory, CNN-LSTM) and multivariate statistical analysis (factorial design, FD) into a multi-region input-output (MRIO) framework. The FMCL model not only unveils the socioeconomic drivers underlying water consumption patterns, but also quantitatively assess complicated interactions within the economy-water system under multiple scenarios. The FMCL model is then applied to a typical water-scarce region in the Yellow River Basin (three provinces of Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi and Ningxia, abbreviated as Inner-Shaan-Ning region). The main findings are: (i) direct water consumption intensity, industrial structure (agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and accommodation & catering), and per capita household consumption constitute the key socioeconomic drivers of water consumption; (ii) among different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and Ningxia would achieve relatively high levels of economy-water sustainability under SSP2, which represents a pathway of moderate socioeconomic development trends; (iii) the interaction between accommodation & catering and per capita household consumption would be significant; compared to the baseline SSP2, interactive policies that focus on key factors would achieve higher economy-water sustainability; (iv) from 2026 to 2050, the optimal interactive policy in Inner-Shaan-Ning region could reduce annual water consumption per unit of GDP by 1.22%, 3.82% and 3.34%, respectively. These findings cannot only reveal the key drivers and their multi-dimensional interactions within the economy-water system, but also facilitate the transformation of water use pattern into sustainable development.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.143673";"Life cycle assessment of an industrial-scale petrochemical wastewater treatment plant ";" Petrochemical industries produce a huge amount of wastewater during the production of various petrochemical products. The generated wastewater must be properly treated before being released into the environment because it contains harmful chemical compounds that affect human health, the aquatic ecosystem, and the environment. However, studies on the lifecycle assessment of petrochemical wastewater treatment processes on energy recovery are rare. This paper aims to evaluate the environmental impact of an industrial-scale petrochemical wastewater treatment plant (PWWTP) in the Malaysian state of Pahang using a life cycle assessment (LCA) method. The goal of this LCA study was to assess the environmental benefits and drawbacks of an existing treatment plant where greenhouse gas emissions are released directly into the air. In addition, the environmental impacts of the existing treatment plant were compared with those observed in an ideal case in which the methane gas is reused as an energy source. The 2001 version of the Center of Environmental Science-Leiden University (CML2001) impact assessment method was employed using GaBi 9 software, which entailed the analysis of the operational, sludge landfilling, and sludge transportation phases of the treatment process. Among the inventory components, the wastewater (direct emission) showed the highest eutrophication potential (EP) and global warming potential (GWP) in both the actual and hypothetical cases. In contrast, the electricity generation inventory component caused an increased acidification potential (AP) in the case of the existing treatment plant. Most of the global warming potential impact from the treatment results from the anaerobic digestion process. Other indirect global warming potential impacts from the chemical consumption (34.7 kg CO2-eq) and solid sludge transport (13.7 kg CO2-eq) are minimal compared to the treatment and electricity consumption impacts. The second most relevant source of the environmental impact of the treatment plant is electricity generation, which has impacted many categories. Acidification potential (89.2%), fossil abiotic depletion (59.4%), marine ecotoxicity (52%), human toxicity (45%), photochemical ozone depletion, and global warming (15%) are the main impact categories that significantly contributed by electricity consumption by the plant. Simple integration of the anaerobic digestion in the secondary treatment stage with the energy recovery unit reduced the total environmental impact by 30%. The results demonstrate that the least environmental impact was registered for the case where the methane gas produced from the anaerobic digestion is reused, indicating that the use of clean energy can reduce both the overall environmental burden and the treatment plant's operational costs.

This study comprehensively explored the spatiotemporal distribution patterns and trends of WUE and CUE on the plateau from 2001 to 2018 using linear regression analysis and geostatistical methods. The results revealed a gradual decrease in WUE from southeast to northwest, showing a non-linear variation trend during the study period. CUE exhibited relatively minor spatial variations but demonstrated a significant decrease trend in the eastern regions. The results from the Random Forest algorithm and path analysis indicated that ecosystem respiration (Re) was the predominant controlling factor for WUE and CUE in the cold alpine (PA) region. In the temperate, warm temperate (Te&WT) region, temperature emerged as the primary determinant for WUE, while Leaf Area Index (LAI) served as the absolute dominant factor for CUE. Additionally, LAI also played a crucial role in determining WUE and CUE in the tropical and subtropical (Tr&S) region. Partial correlation analysis highlighted the heterogeneity in the responses of WUE and CUE to environmental changes across different regional climates and vegetation types. The findings emphasized the significant impact of biological factors on terrestrial carbon and water cycling processes (WUE and CUE) within the context of global climate change. Furthermore, the study identified a potential linkage between WUE and CUE, with their relationship to vegetation dynamics showing significant variations across various ecosystems. WUE and CUE showed a positive correlation in the western regions, particularly in high-altitude areas, while a negative correlation was observed in eastern regions with high SOC. In the Te&WT and the Tr&S region, the increase of NDVI (Normalized difference vegetation index) suppressed the rise of both WUE and CUE, establishing a negative correlation between them. Conversely, in the PA region, a significant positive correlation trend between WUE and CUE was observed, indicating a positive response to the decrease in NDVI. These findings are of significant importance for advancing the understanding of and effectively addressing climate change, maintaining ecosystem stability, and promoting sustainable socio-economic development.

Therefore, an innovative approach to assess the risk of nitrogen loss to surface waters from crop production at the watershed scale was established, with nitrogen surplus, a more accurate indicator, as a major source factor introduced to the traditional index method. Furthermore, this approach was applied in the Baiyangdian Lake Watershed, a typically agricultural-dominated watershed in China, and the control strategies for farmland nitrogen loss reduction were investigated with scenario analysis. The major results included: (1) Areas with high (2–4 for risk to river, 1.6–3.2 for risk to lake) and very high (>4 for risk to river, >3.2 for risk to lake) risks of nitrogen loss in crop production were relatively small. For example, in the wheat-maize rotation system, these areas accounted for only 2.1–3.5 % and 0.9–1.8% of the total study area, respectively. Additionally, the critical source areas of nitrogen loss were concentrated around the receiving water bodies. (2) The nitrogen surplus in wheat season increased the nitrogen loss to surface waters. Compared to the maize season, the area with high and very high risk for nitrogen loss to the nearby river in wheat-maize rotation system increased by 58.3% and 141.4%. Furthermore, the areas with high and very high risk for nitrogen loss to the lake in wheat-maize rotation system were 129.6% and 220.6% more than that during maize season. (3) Nitrogen loss risk to the nearby rivers was correlated with nitrogen surplus, but nitrogen loss risk to the lake was related to the transport coefficient. (4) The optimized scenario for nitrogen loss reduction in crop production was the combination of nitrogen surplus being less than 20 kg/ha and 500 m banning area around the river with no fertilizer application, which reduced the nitrogen loss risk to the nearby river and to the lake by 94–95% and 89–95%. The results of this study provide a scientific basis for nutrient resource management and non-point source pollution control.

This study investigated MPs removal from sewage effluents using cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB)-modified magnetic biochar (RH-MBC-CTAB) as an adsorbent. Biochars from different biomass were synthesized, surface modified, characterized, and compared for their MPs removal efficacy from aqueous matrices. Batch adsorption studies were initially conducted on synthetic water with 1 μm sized polystyrene (PS) MPs using different MP concentrations (1–10 mg/L) and varying adsorbent dosages (1–10 mg/50 mL) to assess the effect of different process parameters, viz. pH (2–10), humic acid (6–25 mg/L), and competitive ions (0.01–0.2 M). The maximum MPs removal (98%) was achieved at the favorable conditions: initial MPs concentration: 10 mg/L, RH-MBC-CTAB dose: 7 mg/50 mL, pH 4, mixing speed: 180 rpm, and contact time: 3 min. Electrostatic attraction and hydrogen bonding were likely to remove MPs while the MPs adsorption was best fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetics model (R 2 = 0.91) and Langmuir isotherm model (R 2 = 0.94) with the maximum adsorption capacity of 247.52 mg/g. Further, the application of RH-MBC-CTAB on the real-time sewage effluents from sequencing batch reactor (SBR) and moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR)-based STPs spiked with MPs showed up to 96% MPs removal. The reusability results revealed that developed RH-MBC-CTAB could maintain good stability for up to three reusability cycles, therefore offering extensive potential for the removal of MPs from sewage effluents.

Sea level rise will intensify coastal flood threats, making cities without sufficient habitat protection even more vulnerable. However, there is currently a lack of thorough evaluation at the global scale about conservation priorities based on the current habitat cover and the high sea level rise in order to adapt coastal flood risks. Here we assessed the disparity among habitat coverage, exposed population and extreme sea level rise to identify priority areas for future coastal conservation. These priority areas are characterized by a large population residing in low-elevation coastal zones (LECZs), high extreme sea levels (ESLs), and insufficient habitat coverages. In many highly populated countries like China and India, the flooding risk has been underestimated due to insufficient adaptation based on natural processes from coastal habitats. These highly populated countries are especially concerning because they have comparatively less vegetation protection capability and are subjected to high ESLs. Globally, Asian and European nations, such as China, Japan, Bangladesh, Viet Nam, the United Kingdom, Belgium, Ireland, the Netherlands, and Germany, have the highest potential for mitigating coastal risks through natural habitat conservation and restoration. We found that the main contributors to variations in the extreme sea level rise risks are not due to exposure headcounts (6%), but due to inadequate habitat cover (42%), which can be improved through targeted conservation and restoration. Our research identified the global priorities for managing climate resilience that most urgently require ecosystem conservation and restoration in order to prepare for the risks of coastal flooding.

The effective use of water resources is the key to achieving carbon emission reduction, so it is particularly important to review the carbon dioxide emission equivalents of water resource utilization behaviors (CEE-WRUBs) of water users. However, existing research on CEE-WRUBs across various water sectors remains inadequate. Therefore, this study integrates the enhanced CEEA method, LMDI decomposition model, and IOA method to analyze CEE-WRUBs across diverse water use terminals. Then seeks their main driving factors and their transfer pattern among different industries, which are crucial to the realization of the global carbon neutrality objective. The results showed that: (1) China's CEE-WRUBs show a significant downward trend. Industrial water use emerges as the primary source of CEE, but the CEE-WRUBs of most industrial water terminals show a fluctuating downward trend. Grains' water use behavior (WRUBs) absorbed the largest CEE, reaching 14,698 Mt in 2020. (2) the water efficiency effect emerges as the predominant driver behind the increase in CEE-WRUBs most of the time, and holding a prominent position. The carbon emission intensity effect primarily steers the reduction of CEE-WRUBs. (3) the largest net outflow sector of WRUBs embodied carbon in 2007–2020 was transformed from basic material heavy industry (−153.54 Mt in 2007) to agriculture (−128.26 Mt in 2020). Most of the WRUBs embodied carbon of agriculture flows into light industry, while most of the WRUBs embodied carbon of basic material heavy industry flows into finishing heavy industry and construction. The methods and results of this study provide a potential reference for investigating the regional water-carbon relationship and advancing the global carbon neutrality objective.

The FW-BW substrate was gravity-separated and pretreated with hydrodynamic cavitation (HDC). Solids from gravity separation were used for energy generation via anaerobic digestion (AD) alone or integrated with microbial electrolysis cells (AD-MEC). HDC pretreatment had 51.6% more CH4 production in 5 days (266 mL CH4/g VS) and 63% more in 30 days compared to AD without HDC. The CH4 production after 5 days of digestion with HDC pretreatment (266 mL CH4/g VS) was similar to the amount produced without HDC over 30 days (263 mL CH4/g VS). Using MEC increased CH4 production by 12.7% compared to AD-only. The liquids from gravity separation were treated with electrocoagulation (EC) at 15 V (90 min), which removed 96.2% of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 100% of the total suspended solids. The pilot scale design indicates that the AD-MEC and EC units would generate 1.4 times more energy than energy consumed through applying these novel technologies.

In order to achieve sustainability in a holistic sense, the environmental, social, and economic impacts of equipment used in buildings need to be evaluated. In this regard, a novel decision support framework is introduced to evaluate the heating and cooling equipment in single-family detached homes. Energy simulation, life cycle environmental, social, and economic analyses, and a multi-criteria decision-making method are used to identify the most sustainable set of equipment. This framework is demonstrated through its application on mechanical and water heating equipment in three existing residential buildings of varying energy efficiencies (low, medium, and high, the latter being net-zero home) over a 50-year study period. The results indicate that the carbon footprint of a natural gas furnace is six times higher than that of other equipment. In contrast, the drain water heat recovery unit showed the lowest impacts attributed to lower material and energy usage. For most equipment, the product stage accounted for more than 50% of the total impacts. When grouped, the equipment in the low-efficiency home showed the highest environmental impacts, while the equipment in the medium-efficiency home had higher social and economic impacts. Overall, the equipment set in a net-zero home is the best choice under equal, pro-social, and pro-economic scenarios and only lags behind the equipment set in a medium-efficiency home for pro-environmental scenario.

It combines the combination weight method, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) with the ideal solution, and integrates the Voronoi diagram into the framework. The combined weight method is used to integrate the objective characteristics of the data and the preferences of decision makers. UMAP and ideal solution are used to reduce the dimension and identify alternatives respectively. Voronoi diagram is used to understand the decision-making process.

This study employs system dynamics and dynamic adaptive policy pathways to assess Shanghai's water supply security risks and responsive strategies in 2022–2050, amidst extreme climate conditions. Utilizing data from 2000 to 2021, we constructed a system dynamics model to predict future water demand under various development modes. Focusing on the unusual 2022 drought in the Yangtze River Basin, we simulated 15 scenarios, including economy, population, water efficiency, and reservoir levels, to identify the extent and timing of potential water supply risks, then proposed pertinent dynamic adaptive strategies to address them. Our findings suggest that the 2022 drought significantly reduced Shanghai's water supply capacity, leading to a notable deficit. Under scenarios of accelerated economic growth, water supply security risks are heightened, with projections indicating a reduction of days of supply available to merely 33–67 days, and escalating water shortage amount to 592–896 million m3 by 2050. Short-to-medium-term recommendations include optimizing both local and transit water resources, strengthening emergency water reserves, enhancing water use efficiency, and maintaining stable reservoir water levels. For the long term, expanding water storage infrastructure and promoting integrated water resource management within the Yangtze River Delta is key to establishing a resilient and diversified water supply system, effectively mitigating future water security risks. This study provides a scientific basis and reference for the sustainable management of water resources in estuarine cities confronting normalized extreme climate conditions. It offers valuable insights for policymakers and actionable suggestions for urban planners. ";"2024-09-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624027483";"1";"Water Other"

This relevance is particularly evident in Brazil, where significant strides have been made in microgeneration of photovoltaic solar power and on-shore large-scale horizontal-axis wind power. Despite the country's extensive energy capacity from hydroelectric facilities, still approximately 38.5 million people reside in rural areas and surrounding areas, emphasizing the need for effective and affordable energy solutions for these regions. Based on this social and business opportunity of small-sized devices used in sustainable development, this practical experimentation explores the viability of initial studies from a prototyped small vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) system for water pumping, comparing its technical and economic feasibility with commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) photovoltaic solar pump (PV) and conventional electrical pump systems (EP). Two scenarios are investigated: (1) a patented transmission mechanism connected to a double effect pump and (2) the VAWT system designed to be connected to the same mechanism. Compared to PV ‘systems, scenario (1) offers 1.4x higher flowrate at a significantly lower cost (137% less) and consumes half the power. It offers a lower flowrate (2.6x) than EP systems but at a lower cost (36% less) and consumes one-third the power. Scenario (2) provides 2.7x less water flow than PV at a slightly lower cost (41% less). While less efficient in water flow (10 x) compared to EP, it has a slightly higher cost (15% more). This research builds upon existing knowledge and offers valuable insights for future small VAWT applications in low-wind remote areas for water pumping.

However, they also present a potential threat to ecosystems and human health as emerging contaminants. In this study, co-immobilization of nanozyme (PtCo) and laccase (Lac) into dendritic mesoporous silica (DMSN) constitutes nanomaterials (Lac@PtCo@DMSN). PtCo with an atomic ratio of 3:1 has the highest oxidizing activity. DMSN exhibited a maximum Lac loading capacity of 365 mg/g and activity of Lac@PtCo@DMSN exhibits excellent pH, temperature, and storage stability and reusability, and demonstrated greater recoverability. Remarkably, Lac@PtCo@DMSN (50 mg) achieved 81.83% degradation of total PAEs within 72 h and maintained 72.44% degradation of dimethyl phthalate (DMP) in the fifth cycle. Electron transfer between Pt, Co and adsorbed oxygen (O2ads) in PtCo can generate •OH and •O2 −, which were the dominant reactants for PAEs degradation. •OH could degrade PAEs to phthalic acid via H-abstration and •OH addition. •OH effectively enhanced Lac activity, and promoted the synergistic catalytic performance of nanozymes and natural enzymes. The degradation of phthalic acid by Lac accelerated the release of PtCo@DMSN reaction sites, resulting in significantly enhanced PAEs degradation. Thus, artificial/natural enzymes can degrade PAEs without exogenous additives to solve the limitation of Lac application, providing a new strategy for degrading contaminants in water.

In response, inter-basin water transfer initiatives have been advocated as potential remedies. Though effective in providing immediate relief, the long-term viability of these initiatives is disputed. Notably, recurring scarcity can result from increased water demand in the recipient basin due to transferred water. Addressing this requires balancing water demand and supply. Beyond supply-focused measures such as water transfers, a crucial strategy involves adopting demand-focused approaches to reduce reliance on such transfers. This study centers on the Gavkhouni basin in Iran, where despite repeated water transfers, water scarcity remains persistent due to climate fluctuations, population growth, agricultural activities, and economic development. The research developed a comprehensive system dynamic model, integrating environmental, social, and economic variables impacting water balance in the region in order to assess the effectiveness of three distinct demand-focused water management strategies, namely, technology-based, cropping pattern-based, and land-based policies, both individually and in synergy. This analysis was conducted across a set of scenarios encompassing climate change, population growth, GDP dynamics, and water transfer patterns. The findings revealed a satisfactory accuracy of the water management system model, with a 6.2% mean absolute error. In addition, findings highlighted the advantages of a multifaceted strategy, with technology-driven interventions and optimized cropping patterns emerging as particularly effective. However, the economic dimensions of these policies warrant comprehensive exploration due to the significant impact they have on the feasibility and effectiveness of the policies. The study emphasizes the need to combine demand-side policies with supply strategies like water transfers.

However, there has been limited analysis of water-energy-carbon (WEC) nexus within regional trade network to uncover the effects of industrial restructuring. Here, this study explores the trade-related WEC flows in the Yangtze River Delta area (YRD) from 2012 to 2017 by four aspects (spatiotemporal status, sectors, WEC flowing synergies, and environmental-economic trade-off) based on an environmentally extended input-output analysis. The main results show that the resource supply network in the YRD has been optimized, with enhanced synergies of WEC flows. Resource trade in the YRD has shifted from traditional heavy industry (HV Ⅰ) to high-tech manufacturing industry (HV Ⅱ). The share of trade-related WEC in demand of HV Ⅱ among all sectors increased by 10, 5, and 15 percentages, while the share in demand of HV Ⅰ decreased by 15, 10, and 10 percentages during this transition period. This study also discloses an environmental-economic contradiction arising in regional trade: low-carbon and high-value-added economic development in some regions may be premised on relocating environmental resource pressures. Hence, this study could assist policymakers in analyzing sustainable industrial transition models for regional integration clusters and in formulating targeted interregional resource trade policies to alleviate development gaps.

Besides being hazardous to source water and water treatments, these algae threaten drinking water distribution system (DWDS). Yet little information is available for odorous risks occurring, responding, and transforming in real DWDS. Hence, two algae (Microcystis aeruginosa, MA; Pseudanabaena sp., PS) were selected for pilot studies. Two ways were verified for algal occurrence, including insufficient water treatments and DWDS-biofilm attachment. MA survived moderate disinfectant exposures and restored odorants (β-cyclocitral). Also, MA could be attached to biofilm and its detachment occurred upon flushing (0.60 m/s). These occurrence ways were not seen for PS. Three factors were compared for living algae in DWDS. Flow velocities had minimal impacts on MA but affected PS odorant (2-methylisobropanol, 2-MIB) releases. Releasing rates increased by 115.79% with velocity from 0.05 m/s to 1.50 m/s. Disinfectants were the riskiest, maximizing risks for MA and PS, respectively at 0.30 mg/L NH2Cl and 1.00 mg/L Cl2. Coexisting antibiotics showed selective effects and reduced risks, e.g., tetracycline reduced MA intensity and PS odorant production. For naked odorant transformation, 2-MIB in DWDS had reduced degradation ratios compared to beaker conditions. Overall, odorous risks by MA and PS were different. MA was tough and could resist water treatments and adverse stressors in DWDS, with partial odorants remaining within cells. PS was vulnerable to treatments and DWDS, and the released odorants were not degradable. Hence, customized management is required for various algal odorous problems in DWDS.

However, residual neutralizing agents, long-chain aliphatic hydrocarbons derived from epoxidised soybean oil, and the oxygen inhibition inherent in the UV curing process often cause poor thermal resistance and mechanical properties of the epoxidised soybean oil-based waterborne bio-based UV-curable coatings. Herein, the epoxidised soybean oil was hydrophilized by citric acid and poly (ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether without the use of neutralizing agents. The hydrophilized epoxidised soybean oil was subsequently compounded with bisphenol A epoxy resin to prepare high-performance waterborne bio-based epoxy methacrylates. Finally, a high-performance waterborne bio-based UV-thermal dual-curable coating was obtained by blending waterborne bio-based epoxy methacrylates with waterborne isocyanate curing agent. The results demonstrated that waterborne bio-based epoxy methacrylates possess high bio-based content, low viscosity, and remarkable storage stability. Furthermore, waterborne bio-based UV-thermal dual-curable coatings with high cross-linking density exhibited outstanding mechanical properties and thermal resistance. For example, the waterborne bio-based UV-thermal dual-curable coatings P0805I4 exhibits a breaking elongation of 30.75%, maximum tensile strength of 16.68 MPa, T10% at 285.33 °C, and adhesion class level of 0.

This study investigates the benefits of organic alternatives, such as vermicompost and bio-fertilizers, in sustainable peppermint production. The aim is to foster environmentally friendly agricultural practices and enhance soil health. Multiple fertilizer treatments were examined for their impact on peppermint growth, essential oil (EO) content, and bioactive properties. Results show that incorporating vermicompost with chemical or bio-fertilizers significantly improves plant height, dry leaf weight, leaf number, and drug fraction by 18.6%, 82%, 27.5%, and 25%, respectively. Vermicompost application leads to a remarkable 100% increase in EO content and a substantial 31.5% rise in menthol percentage compared to other treatments. Furthermore, the study reveals that enhanced menthol production coincides with improved antibacterial and antifungal properties of the plant extract and EO. Treatments with bio-fertilizers demonstrate a significant 23.4% increase in menthol percentage compared to the control group. Vermicompost usage also boosts the total phenolic, flavonoid, and anthocyanin content, along with the antioxidant capacity by 5%–17%. Replacing chemical fertilizers with vermicompost and bio-fertilizers shows notable improvements in peppermint production.

However, few optimization methodologies incorporate spatial heterogeneity information. The novelty of our research is (1) enhancing the “Model + optimization + decision-making” optimization framework of GIs and (2) incorporating spatial heterogeneity into GIs multi-objective spatial optimization. In this study, a novel multi-factor spatial heterogeneity adaptation optimization framework (MFSHAOF) was proposed to refine regional adaptability of existing GIs multi-objective optimization methods by parameterizing objective weights using a factor-based strategy. Multi-factor was quantified in terms of urban floods, Non-point Source (NPS) pollution, and economic constraints at a subdistrict level using hydrological and water quality model simulation, and socio-economic data mining.

To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic investigation on the effects of three anthropogenic-disturbance levels (i.e., low in the upstream, moderate in the midstream, and high in the downstream reach) on algal communities in water and sediment of the Bahe River. Our results revealed that planktonic rather than sedimentary algae were more vulnerable to anthropogenic activities in the urban river. Notably, we found the lowest biodiversity and niche breadth of planktonic algae in the downstream subjected to the high anthropogenic stress. Furthermore, the lowest complexity and stability of co-occurrence patterns of planktonic algae as well as planktonic algae-bacteria were witnessed under the highest human disturbance. Anthropogenic activities, followed by physicochemical variables, geographical patterns, and bacteria co-occurring with algae, played essential roles in shaping the niche differentiation and community assembly of planktonic algae.

SS increased the Corg density in the sediment by approximately two times, exceeding that of the dense carbon ecosystems found in global seagrass meadows and peatlands. The complexation of the low-molecular-weight Corg with iron in SS was the main pathway for Corg fixation. Benthic animal investigations showed that SS capping fostered an anaerobic fauna ecosystem, aiding biotic Corg sequestration. Algae proliferation on the SS bed suggested complex benthic ecosystems with photosynthetic carbon fixation. Overall, SS beds offer a new abiotic carbon sequestration pathway with environmental restoration benefits; in situ capping with metal-containing material is potentially more economical and sustainable compared to traditional landfilling.

Sustainable management requires coordinating the interactions between water and the other socio-environmental systems, which we term ‘systems water management (SYWM)’. To understand the generic social-water interactions and obtain management implications for green-red loop systems, we develop a SYWM meta-model that conceptualises high-level social-environmental components and formulates their interactions into casual loops. This meta-model is evaluated via structural equation modelling using global datasets. Red- and green-loop scenarios are constructed to investigate the SYWM differences, and mediation analysis is conducted to quantify the reciprocal effects through the loops. Results show a critically weak causal link (0.22) from environmental state to quality of life, implying that the current water management performances have not been successfully incorporated for guiding further social development. Green- and red-loop systems have different direct causal effects in each link, which drives the corresponding behaviour. Red-loop systems have stronger total effects in causal links within the human system, depicting their strengths in socio-economic and water management decision-making. In contrast, green-loop systems have stronger total effects within the natural system, which symbolises receiving more environmental feedback.

In response, China has launched the water management strategy of “production determined by water”. But the nationwide economic, energy, and carbon benefits of this initiative have yet to be assessed, which is crucial considering China is the largest carbon emitter and energy consumer. In this study, we establish a comprehensive framework to incorporate economic losses, energy consumption, and carbon emissions into the analysis of water constrained measures. Firstly, we evaluated the current status of water-energy-carbon in China. Then, the water-scarce regions and sectors was identified to formulate 216 water-constrained scenarios. Finally, we extended the multi-regional input-output model (MRIO) to accommodate supply constraints for quantifying the cross-system impacts of the scenarios. The results underscore agriculture, chemicals, food and tobacco, electricity and heating production, and construction as focal water-intensive and constrained sectors. With water constraint, the agricultural sector can minimize economic losses but only yield limited energy saving and emission reduction. While the construction, metal product manufacturing, electricity and heating production, and chemicals industries, can achieve higher synergistic benefits of water conservation, energy saving, and emission reduction under water constraints. Additionally, the northern coastal region displayed the strongest response, with 1 m³ water constraint leads to energy savings of 0.945–6.354 kgce and emission reductions of 2.11–39.32 kgCO2. The study provides valuable insights for the development of multi-objective water constrained policies.

In this study, the degradation efficiencies of various oxidation methods, including hydrodynamic cavitation (HC), dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma oxidation, ultraviolet C (UVC), and their combination HC + DBD + UVC, were investigated for Methyl Orange (MO). The photolysis of ozone (O3) and the degradation mechanism associated with HC + DBD + UVC were analyzed to elucidate the pathway of MO degradation. The results demonstrated that the combination of HC + DBD + UVC exhibited a significantly enhanced degradation efficiency compared to other process combinations, achieving a removal efficiency exceeding 91% within a 5-min timeframe. Optimal parameters for achieving a 99.5% degradation rate of 10 mg/L MO were determined as follows: pH 4, inlet pressure of 1.5 MPa, utilization of eight UV lamps with a power input of 46.11 W. During the degradation process, hydroxyl radicals (·OH) and ozone (O3) played crucial roles, while the incorporation of UV lamps effectively mitigated ozone (O3) emissions and enhanced the oxidation of ozone (O3). In conjunction with the analysis of degradation products using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, it is highly probable that the MO degradation pathway involves reductive cleavage of the azo bond through ·OH attack. Compared to other experimental methods in literature, HC + DBD + UVC exhibits significant advantages such as enhanced efficiency and absence of additives. This innovative approach offers a rapid and practical on-site solution for efficient MO dye wastewater treatment.

To quantify the preferential flow development (PFI) in soil profile-scale through soil profile indexes, we carried out dual-tracer experiments with dyeing in two types of forest restoration lands (plantation forest, PF, and natural secondary forest, NSF) in the paleo-periglacial landform forestland to obtain the soil water infiltration trajectories and water-solute transport characteristics. The indexes of preferential flow morphology and pathway diversity (solute migration) were integrated to construct a more complete evaluation system of the PFI. In addition, we explored factors affecting the PFI through soil physical properties and root characteristics. The results showed that: (1) There were obvious preferential flows in both PF and NSF. Compared with NSF, preferential flow in PF diverged earlier, had greater non-equilibrium degree, more paths and higher development degree, and preferential flow was the main infiltration form. (2) Changes in infiltration amount played a key role in altering the PFI, i.e., increasing infiltration amount reduced the PFI, especially in PF (p < 0.05); (3) After water infiltration, the solute Br− diffusion range of the soil profile was wider than that of Brilliant Blue tracer, thus the development of preferential flow was better synthetical reflected by the indexes of water flow morphology and solute distribution characteristics; (4) Differences in the PFI can be explained by variations in clay content, total porosity (TP), and root volume density (RVD), with total path coefficients of 0.824, 0.462, and 0.624, respectively. In addition to establishing different forest restoration types in similar areas, it would be worthwhile to strengthen the prevention and control measures of soil and water loss in NSF, and properly manage PF in a near-natural model to enhance ecologically sustainable development of forest land. The results of this study contribute to the understanding of the hydrological processes of forest ecosystems in paleo-periglacial landforms, and provide theoretical support for the proposed forest management strategies.

Notwithstanding advancement, Bongaigaon is a highly flood-afflicted district in the lower part of this region, inflicting significant damage to both lives and property almost every consecutive year. Hence, the delineation of precise and reliable flood risk susceptibility zones within the district constitutes the foremost concern of the study. The present work considered a total of sixteen multi-collinearity free parameters integrating with the GIS- based Multi-Criteria Decision Making-Analytical Hierarchy Process (MCDM-AHP) model for identifying potential flood hazard zones (FHZ), flood vulnerability zones (FVZ), and flood risk zones (FRZ) for the region. The result revealed that over 28% of the district's total area falls under the high to very high flood risk zone. Srijangram circle covers the highest flood risk zone with 343.19 sq. km. The FHZ map of the district demonstrated reliability exceeding 90% in ROC-AUC and below 40% in MSE and RMSE. Additionally, sensitivity analyses depict the role indicators in the predictive model, placed as a virgin gap for study in the region. Moreover, a multivariate correlation statistic is used to examine the potential risk zones and temporal flood effects on different Revenue Circles (RC), showing R2 over 0.6 in each category. The robustness of this model manifests sensible findings, aiding in fortifying sustainable flood management strategies to mitigate risks at different levels. Strategies adopted here contain greater potential for current as well as future trends in similar domains of research.

Hence, this study proposes a computational framework to calculate the rainfall return period according to the runoff return period. Based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the optimal probability distribution functions, a novel approach was proposed to combine the rainfall and maximum pipe flow return periods. Copula functions were employed to construct a joint probability distribution for calculating the rainfall return period using the maximum pipe flow return period. Thus, this study reached the following results. (I) The Gamma, Logistic, and Weibull distributions provided better descriptions for the rainfall and maximum pipe flow probability distributions. The Gaussian, Gumbel, and Survival Clayton Copula functions were shown to be the optimal choices. (II) A calculation method for the rainfall return period was constructed based on the Satisfaction Percentage (SP). For instance, using a 2-year as the maximum pipe flow return period, the rainfall return period was determined to be 4.705 years (60 min of rainfall duration, Maluan community) with an SP value of 0.95. (III) The study area showed non-significant impacts (p < 0.05) in selecting the rainfall return periods.

Nevertheless, factors such as water scarcity, limited land resources, and global climate change pose great challenges to increasing food production. Therefore, it is crucial to explore sustainable development models for food systems. In this paper, a multi-objective crop layout model considering crop rotation is constructed and solved using the INSGA2-DS algorithm. Various precipitation scenarios were established for climate change. Data analysis and optimization were conducted under different precipitation scenarios. Applied in the plain area of southwestern Shandong Province, the model can increase soybean yield by 6.78%, net carbon sequestration intensity by 0.04%, net benefit by 2.09%, and crop water productivity by 3.91% during a median flow year. Optimization tends to increase the total area planted with food crops during wet years and decrease it during dry years. The optimization model can enhance water productivity and carbon sequestration intensity of crops, as well as prevent unreasonable fluctuations in the area planted with food crops. This enables the benefits of water conservation and yield increase to be fully utilized, and reduces yield and economic losses due to dry years. The models help to rationally allocate soil and water resources, effectively respond to climate change risks, and provide robust decision support for regional food crop planning.

Evidence from Jiangxi Province, China ";" The clean transformation of domestic sewage treatment is essential for addressing the challenges of current rural environmental pollution. Village cadres, as rural leaders, play a crucial role in organizing and coordinating farmers' participation in improving sewage treatment. Although previous studies have highlighted the importance of domestic sewage treatment, research on how rural leaders' qualities influence farmers' sewage treatment practices remains significantly limited. To fill this gap and clarify the relationship between the qualities of village cadres and farmers' participation in domestic sewage treatment, this study focuses on analyzing whether improving the village cadres’ quality can lead to enhanced scientific treatment of rural domestic sewage by farmers. Through linear regression analysis of a sample of rural residents in Jiangxi Province, China, this study demonstrates that the improved quality of village cadres positively affects farmers' scientific treatment of domestic wastewater. The study also finds that farmers' trust in village cadres plays a significant role in aiding high-quality leaders to improve farmers' scientific wastewater treatment behaviors. Moreover, compared to farmers in villages without a representative village council system, those in villages with such a system are more likely to be influenced by high-quality village cadres, thereby improving their wastewater treatment practices. Based on these findings, this article offers practical implications for policymakers and researchers aiming to strengthen rural environmental governance and sustainable development efforts.

However, only a few studies have investigated water and energy consumption simultaneously in a crop cultivation life cycle. In this study, we established a bottom–up framework to explore water and energy consumption in each period of the crop growth process, including sowing, germination, growth, maturation, and harvesting. We propose a novel homogenization index, the Water–Energy Efficiency for Food (WEEF) index, to compare crop production efficiency by reasonably eliminating regional location effects. Changes in water and energy consumption were evaluated for six major crops in China, including wheat, maize, rice, soybean, peanut, and cotton. The results showed that the water and energy consumption during the main growth period were largely synchronized in most regions, with peak periods occurring in July–August and May–June. Owing to the increased use of agricultural machinery and irrigation energy, the total energy consumption per unit yield of cotton, maize, and rice increased by 28%, 19%, and 16%, respectively, in 2018 compared with 2012, reaching 25.81, 2.53, and 2.49 MJ/kg, respectively. The WEEF index revealed that the efficiency of wheat and soybean production in China surpassed that of other crops. In general, the average crop production efficiency in the northern region was about 4％ lower than that in the southern region.

Considering that cotton is the most manufactured natural fiber and that textile dyeing plays an indispensable role in serving people's demand for fashion and aesthetics, this study conducted an integrated impact-oriented carbon–water–energy (CWE) footprint analysis of dyed cotton fabric production in China from a cradle-to-gate perspective. Results showed that the carbon, energy, and freshwater ecotoxicity footprints of dyeing 1 ton of pure cotton fabrics were 15627.20 kg CO2 eq, 3405.30 kg oil eq, and 2.01 × 105 PAF·m3·d, respectively. Fiber production, chemical production, and direct emissions were identified as the major contributors to CWE footprints. Cotton straw mulching, advanced dyeing technology, and national power structure optimization were explored to foster sustainable optimization of the cotton-made textile industry. At the conventional wet-processing stage, the dyeing phase had the greatest contribution (56.3%–85.6%) to the environmental impacts from chemicals, followed by pretreatment with a 13.8%–28.3% share. Nonaqueous dyeing routes reduced carbon footprint by 49.1% and water scarcity by 75% compared with water-based dyeing processes, with noticeable increases in noncarcinogen and carcinogen categories.

This new approach was applied to an integrated textile facility mainly employing cotton fabric finishing and printing-dyeing. After potential implementation of selected 12 BATs, the reduction potentials in the existing water/carbon footprints were calculated. The blue water, grey water and total water footprint values of the facility were found to be 126, 837 and 963 L/kg product, respectively. The total carbon footprint value of the facility was found to be 7.011 kg CO2eq/kg product, and most of this comes from steam use. The optimization of resin regeneration frequency/duration and washing-rinsing steps in the water softening system via online hardness sensors provides 20–30% reductions in blue water footprint values. It was calculated that when BATs from 1 to 7 together are implemented in the facility, an average of 68.5% reduction in the total water footprint could be achieved. Alternatively, when BATs 1–5 and 8 are implemented, such reduction is 45.6%, highlighting the effectiveness of the selected BATs. BAT 9 exhibited the highest reduction in total carbon footprints due to the fact that it is related to minimization of energy losses. If all selected BATs are to be implemented in the facility, a reduction of 1.179 kg CO2eq/kg product could be achieved in the total carbon footprint, corresponding to 16.8% reduction. Significant reductions in energy consumption could be achieved through techniques/applications such as isolation of hot surfaces, reducing reprocesses by improving dyehouse-laboratory coordination, optimizing recipes and applying correct dyeing techniques at once, making lighting systems efficient, process modifications/optimizations in pre-treatment and final finishing processes, and reducing water consumption in processes requiring hot water.

However, virtual water trade isn't always beneficial for enhancing water resource sustainability; instead, it often leads to serious trade distortion problems due to unreasonable industrial and trade structures. This study employs pathway decomposition method to highlight the path characteristics of such distortions, revealing how virtual water trade distortions occur, why there are regional differences, and what insights can be gained for policy formulation. The study focuses on the agricultural sectors of seven key provinces in China. Findings indicate that virtual water in these provinces' agricultural sectors is predominantly exported through inter-regional and inter-sectoral intermediate goods trade. Furthermore, in regions where virtual water trade distortion is more severe, this characteristic becomes more apparent, leading to significant exports of virtual water. However, the trade chains for importing virtual water are usually short and direct, resulting in a relatively low volume of virtual water imports. These characteristics are closely related to the value chain participation mode. The policy implication is: while ""value chain upgrading"" has become a trendy term, merely improving trade conditions without enhancing the processing of agricultural products for export, or simply increasing imports of low-end intermediate inputs without upgrading the agricultural input structure for imports, offers no assistance in alleviating virtual water trade distortions. Based on these findings, we propose several differentiated strategies to mitigate virtual water trade distortions.

Different interconnected concepts of flood management lead decision-makers to broaden their focus from traditional points of view to transcend the disciplinary boundaries of hydrological modeling. So, evaluating interconnected aspects of flood control requires configuring an Integrated Flood Management (IFM) system. In this research, a novel comprehensive framework is proposed to control floods in urban and non-urban areas using Low-Impact Development (LID) practices and detention dams, simultaneously. In the first step, urban and non-urban areas of the Darakeh catchment in Tehran, Iran, as the study area, are modeled using Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). Next, by coupling the SWMM with Pareto Envelope-based Selection Algorithm II (PESA-II), optimal management scenarios are generated considering four hydrological-economic objectives. Each management scenario specifies the optimal sites and dimensions of detention dams and the optimal location and area of LIDs in non-urban and urban areas, respectively. Indeed, the innovative IFM framework provides a multi-dimensional trade-off between upstream and downstream flood protection. Then, interactions among the main stakeholders with conflicting interests are incorporated into utility functions. Ultimately, using COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) and Nash bargaining methods the most capable management scenarios are selected based on stakeholders' preferences. Results showed that the IFM framework can be significantly effective in flood severity attenuation. Based on the findings, proposed method warrants peak flow reduction up to 60.04 and 53.50 percent at the inlet and outlet of the urban area. Besides, the Nash bargaining approach tends to select a scenario with a higher peak flow reduction compared to the COPRAS method. Also, results signify that each stakeholder's relative importance and preferences can remarkably impact the decision-making process. In addition to resolving conflicts arising from implementing flood control measures, this framework can incorporate divergent aspects of flood management into a reliable system.

However, systematic investigations of the DO regulation mechanisms underlying the removal of key pollutants that cause black, odorous waters after CSOs are lacking. In this study, we investigated the effects of different DO regulation levels associated with short- and long-term side-stream supersaturated (SSS) oxygenation on the formation of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and other black odorous pollutants after CSOs. In addition, the effects of different DO levels regulated by SSS oxygenation were determined using the modified entropy weight method. The results showed that the number of CSOs, the rate of the black-odor phenomenon (12 h), and its extent increased. After different SSS oxygenation steps, the odorous degree of CSOs was reduced to varying extents. Additionally, for SSS oxygenation-mediated DO regulation to yield a DO ≥ 3.0 mg L−1, the oxygen-deficient reduction state of the interface between the overlying water and CSO-induced turbid water was effectively reversed. The removal rates of sulfide, Fe2+, and other black odorous substances varied; high levels of SSS oxygenation-mediated DO regulation were more conducive to the emergency improvement of redox conditions (182.67%) and removal of NH3–N (0.616–0.638 mg L−1·d−1). However, regulation of such high DO levels was not as effective for the long-term removal of black malodorous substances, leading to a rapid decline in pH (lowest decrease to 5.68) and denitrification efficiency in later stages. Additionally, evaluating the effectiveness of different SSS oxygenations provided further evidence that medium to high DO levels (4.5 mg L−1) achieved the highest comprehensive scores of 23.81 and had the optimal cost-effectiveness for long-term regulation.

Although energy and water infrastructures are often viewed as separate and uncoupled due to distinct processes in power generation and water production, they are fundamentally interlinked within their respective domains. This necessitates a strong coupling to optimally manage power and water resources simultaneously. To address this, a joint optimization algorithm has been developed to manage the supply-side resources of the Energy–Water–Food Nexus (EWFN), including the power, water, food, cogeneration, and storage networks. A mathematical model is first developed to dispatch clear power, potable water, and storage resources, considering constraints related to supply, demand, production, flow, and ramping. Additionally, the integration of a water storage facility alleviates binding constraints, enabling flat production to reduce costs and CO 2 emissions. The proposed methodology also allows for the real-time quantification of production costs, energy mix, reserve and curtailed capacities, and energy imbalances.

We analyzed the spatiotemporal variations of phytoplankton diversity in cold regions, employing techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Spearman correlation coefficient, and Generalized Additive Model (GAM) to unveil the critical environmental factors influencing phytoplankton diversity and habitat suitability under varying degrees of human interference. With 37 monitoring stations across two cold region rivers, phytoplankton and water bodies were monitored in spring, summer, and autumn, resulting in the collection and analysis of 111 phytoplankton samples and 13 environmental indicators at each station. By identifying critical water quality indicators and exploring nonlinear relationships, the study revealed intricate interactions between phytoplankton diversity and environmental factors. Our findings suggest that overall phytoplankton species diversity is lower in rivers with high human interference, with turbidity, NH4 +-N, chlorophyll-a, and total phosphorus (TP) deemed critical factors. Conversely, chlorophyll-a, NH4 +-N, and electrical conductivity (EC) were identified as important factors in rivers with lower human interference, indicating differences in phytoplankton driving mechanisms between the two rivers. These insights provide valuable references for the sustainable development and effective assessment of cold region river ecosystems in the Anthropocene.

The findings of this study reveal that the groundwater in the LCP has an average pH value of 7.6, indicating weak alkalinity. The groundwater types are predominantly mixed, followed by Cl–Ca. The NO3 − concentration in groundwater is relatively high, with a mean value of 326 mg/L, originating mainly from agricultural production activities. In addition to NO3 −, the spatial distribution analysis of the principal chemical constituents in the groundwater demonstrated a subtle north-south gradient. The chemical signatures of groundwater are primarily influenced by the process of rock weathering, resulting from the dissolution of silicates and carbonates minerals as well as gypsum. Indeed, cation exchange represents a pivotal hydrogeochemical reaction within the groundwater system of the region. The intrusion of seawater into groundwater primarily exhibits a mild nature, mostly in the form of mixing intrusion in the initial stage, affecting the western and northern regions of the LCP to a greater extent. The primary source of groundwater recharge is attributed to atmospheric precipitation; however, it is partially affected by evaporation. In addition, LCP groundwater is also being recharged by seawater intrusion, mainly in the western and northern parts of the study area. Overall, the findings of this research hold significant implications for the strategic management of groundwater resources and the implementation of measures to prevent and mitigate seawater intrusion not only in the LCP but also in analogous coastal regions across the globe.

However, limited research has focused on regime changes in SES under different modes of water resource utilization. In this study, we employ a concise theoretical framework to analyze regime shifts in the arid Tarim River Basin, considering changes in SES components. Additionally, we explore the drivers and local and regional effects of these shifts. The regime shifts in SES are categorized into four evolutionary phases: “Low productivity,” “Slow population expansion,” “Rapid environmental destruction,” and “Ecological restoration and improvement” over the past 12,000 years. The reciprocal coupling of SES components plays a vital role in determining the regime of SES, which is heavily influenced by the utilization of water resources and the degradation of the environment. While increasing water consumption is a core factor leading to environmental destruction, it also drives socioeconomic growth. During the process of SES shift, the rational allocation and use of water resources can shape an ideal regime that promotes regional ecosystem restoration. The empirical connections between the different phases of SES in the regime shift, their drivers, and their adverse or beneficial impacts provide valuable insights for sustainable SES management. Lessons from basin management that solely pursues single goals and focuses on local aspects, without considering these connections, have significant implications for long-term planning and policy formulation in arid basins worldwide.

However, the deionized water-extracted CSUS usually contains a large amount of impurities that easily lead to bioclogging during the biogrouting process, resulting in a nonuniform biomineralization effect. In this study, a purification method using inorganic flocculants is proposed to extract CSUS with relatively high purity and urease activity (UA) for EICP method. Seven commonly used inorganic flocculants were adopted in this study, including KAl(SO4)2•12H2O, AlCl3•6H2O, Al2(SO4)3•18H2O, Fe2(SO4)3, poly aluminum chloride, poly ferric sulfate, and poly aluminum ferric chloride. Three sets of tests, including CSUS extraction tests, solution tests, and sand column treatment tests, were conducted to investigate the feasibility and validity of this purification method. The test results show that inorganic flocculants could effectively reduce the turbidity of the extracted CSUS, avoid the bioclogging during biogrouting, and thus improve the biomineralization effect of the CSUS-based EICP method. Compared with deionized water-based CSUS, at least 60% of the impurities in CSUS can be removed at optimal flocculant contents when the soybean powder content is 100 g/L. On the other hand, the flocculants would also cause a reduction in the UA of the extracted CSUS. Considering the UA, turbidity, and biomineralization effect of the extracted CSUS, the optimal inorganic flocculants and their contents are recommended to be 3.0 g/L for KAl(SO4)2•12H2O, 2.0 g/L for AlCl3•6H2O, 2.5 g/L for Al2(SO4)3•18H2O under the tested conditions, respectively.

The overall integrated process was evaluated on the view of mass balance and techno-economic analysis using Aspen Plus modeling. 56 g/L of calcium xylonate (XA-Ca) can be obtained within 8 h from acidic corncob hydrolysate (ACH) at a 100 % yield with the whole-cell catalysis of Gluconobacter oxydans.

Our framework aggregates the stochastic frontier analysis, dynamic panel fixed effects model, and long-difference approach to evaluate the impact of restricting groundwater exploitation on agricultural total factor productivity, agricultural inputs, and outputs in the Huang-Huai-Hai area of China. The results demonstrate that, in the short run, the reduction in groundwater exploitation has a negative impact on agricultural total factor productivity, fertilizer and machines but promotes water input, which results in a more negative effect on agricultural output measured by yield. In the long term, restricting groundwater exploitation still implies a loss of agriculture. However, the long-run adaptation offsets 75% and 64% of the short-run effects on total factor productivity and yield, respectively.

The sediment and phosphorus loads, related migration paths and contribution of source regions to receiving waters at different sections of a river basin are not clear. The modified Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model was utilized to investigate the phosphorus loads and the relationships among water resources, sediment, and phosphorus loads in one of the important tributaries of the Three Gorge Reservoir (TGR) of China, and to investigate the retention dynamics of phosphorus in the river continuum and the influencing factors. It showed that under the scenario of rice terraces and ponds, the annual sediment loss and total phosphorus load were 125t and 2.5t, being reduced by 40%–80% compared to the natural slope scenario; the daily peak value of suspended sediment load was reduced by 30%–75%, and the relationship between the rainfall and runoff was weakened slightly; the retention rate of phosphorus sources reached 40%–78%. The results confirm that the rice terraces and ponds have altered local hydrological conditions, enhanced a substantial water, sediment, and phosphorus retention capacity that is highly consistent over time and space scales, thereby altering the predominant forms of phosphorus and improving the environmental resilience in soil and nutrition loss for the hilly watershed of the TGR.

In future periods, due to global warming and the change in the amount and regime of precipitation, the intensity of groundwater level drop in various parts of the world will increase. This study aims to investigate both single and multiple adaptation strategies to obtain sustainable groundwater resources. At first, the system dynamics model of the Alborz province as the study area, which is located in the center of Iran and includes three aquifers, was developed considering socio-economic, hydrology, agriculture, and energy subsystems. Then, the system was calibrated during an observation period using behavior repetition and extreme conditions tests. Next, the temperature and precipitation data obtained from 16 AOGCM-AR6 models under the SSP2-4.5 scenario were downscaled in the region. The ensemble mean values of temperature and precipitation showed an increase of 1.8 °C in temperature and a 3.5% decrease in precipitation in the period of 2021–2050 compared to the 1985–2014 period. The introduction of downscaled climate scenarios to the developed system dynamics model revealed a sharp drop in the groundwater of the aquifers until 2050. Different adaptation strategies based on water demand management in the agricultural, domestic, and industrial sectors were determined for all three aquifers based on consulting with decision-makers and evaluated using the system dynamics model. Evaluating sustainability indices showed the insignificant effectiveness of each adaptation strategy individually for each aquifer. Meanwhile, the combination of adaptation strategies will not only increase the sustainability of the water systems of the region but will also cause the groundwater level of all aquifers to rise. The framework introduced in this research can be used in most surface and groundwater resource systems to determine the most efficient solutions to adapt to the effects of climate change.

This study focused on analyzing the impact of these factors on HAB occurrences in the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea, identifying influential factors, and predicting future HAB events. For this study, random forest and numerical modeling were employed, with datasets encompassing physical and chemical properties of river water, seawater, and precipitation to assess the impact of discharge on HABs. Additionally, climate change scenarios derived from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) were employed to predict future HAB occurrences, supported by a sensitivity analysis to identify influential factors affecting HAB occurrence. This study demonstrated that the growth rate and occurrence of HABs in the East China Sea (ECS) and Korean coastal waters (KCW) distinctively increased in July and November after the operation of the Three Gorges Dam (TGD). It is likely affected by the decreasing discharge from the Yangtze River (YR) owing to the operation of the TGD. Using the Random Forest model, future HAB events were predicted in good agreement with observations. The sensitivity results revealed that environmental properties, such as precipitation, water temperature, and salinity are major features affecting the HAB trends in both the KCW and YR basins. Moreover, based on the random forest model and climate change scenarios, HAB events were predicted to increase in frequency in July, September, and October.

Monitoring and assessing wetland vulnerability are crucial for ecological conservation and management strategies. However, the framework of wetland vulnerability assessment and the underlying mechanisms have not been well studied. In this study, the spatiotemporal variations in wetland vulnerability on the Qinghai‒Tibet Plateau (QTP) between 1990 and 2020 were investigated based on the ecosystem pattern-process-function framework. The key driving factors were identified by partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) models. Our results showed that the wetland ecosystem pattern index (EPI), ecosystem process index (EPOI), ecosystem function index (EFI), and wetland vulnerability index (WVI) all demonstrated an increasing pattern from northwest to southeast. Between 1990 and 2020, the mean WVI values gradually decreased from 0.616 to 0.588, indicating a steady improvement in the wetland ecosystem on the QTP. Rapid urbanization increased the EPOI, while rugged topography increased both the EPI and EPOI, and the increase in hydrological abundance enhanced the EFI, which in turn contributed to an increase in the WVI. Conversely, climatic conditions led to a reduction in the EPI, which in turn resulted in a significant decrease in the WVI. Therefore, although urbanization and topographical and hydrological factors have somewhat exacerbated the WVI on the QTP, variable climatic conditions have driven the decline in wetland vulnerability in the last three decades. Furthermore, our results indicated that the proposed framework could provide a comprehensive approach for wetland vulnerability assessment and useful implications for wetland conservation and management.

While many studies have focused on the degradation kinetics of its epimer, doxorubicin (DOX), none have reported the kinetics of EPI degradation. Herein, we report a new cost-efficient, environmentally friendly system for the advanced degradation of EPI consisting of cobalt-catalysed bicarbonate-activated peroxide. We propose a new kinetic model for EPI degradation that shows the hydroperoxyl radical is the most important reactive oxygen species (ROS) involved in the degradation process. Seven degradation products are identified using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS). The effect of surfactants, commonly found in wastewaters, is also investigated and the presence of the cationic surfactant hexadecylpyridinium chloride (CPC) in the reaction medium leads to a 6.1-fold increase in the degradation rate. Modelling the reaction kinetics using the Piszkiewicz model unveils the rate constant for the micellar degradation of EPI to be 4.66 × 10 ‐ 3 s ‐ 1 . The ecotoxicity study of the degradation products shows a dramatic decrease in both acute and chronic toxicity. Although the level of mineralisation of the products is less than 10%, this method is still suitable as a pre-treatment of wastewaters.

However, the mechanisms by which the dye can be biodegraded are not well understood. In this study, Bacillus thuringiensis DHC4 was isolated from the gut of a soil-feeding termite, and its ability to degrade aniline blue was investigated. The results showed that DHC4 was highly resistant to both aniline blue and salt, with the decolorization rate reaching 78% and 67% after 96 h of incubation at initial dye concentrations of 1 g/L and 7% salinity, respectively. Aniline blue degradation products were identified based on UV–vis, FTIR, and GC–MS analyses, and genome analysis confirmed that DHC4 contained many potential dye-degrading genes.

A new degradation pathway of aniline blue by DHC4 is proposed, based on analysis of metabolites and differentially expressed genes. This mechanism involves cleavage of aniline blue by oxidoreductases into mono- and diphenyl ring molecules, followed by further methylation and alkylation through methyltransferases.

This paper focuses on three main factors: the percentage of intermediate-sized sediment particles (P), pipe diameter (D), and sediment concentration (S), all of which significantly influence the CNDVS in drip irrigation laterals. To predict the CNDVS, a comprehensive gradient test was developed and the Particle Swarm Optimization-Support Vector Machine (PSO-SVM) algorithm was applied to establish a response surface for predicting the CNDVS. Additionally, the PSO algorithm optimized the penalty parameter (C), loss parameter (ε), and kernel parameter (δ) in the SVM, resulting in a prediction model for the CNDVS. The proposed model was trained and tested using experimental data, and its prediction performance and accuracy were compared with the regression fitting model. The results indicate that within a specific range, the CNDVS increases with higher values of the three factors. The PSO-SVM model, with optimal parameters combination values of C = 486.37, ε = 0.04, and δ = 68.49, provided the most prediction accurate.

Sectoral adjustment policies that focus on enhancing the productivity of specific sectors therefore should prioritize sectors with high growth impact potential but low virtual water demand. However, the diverse understanding of the concept and differing assessment techniques employed by various research communities complicate the debates surrounding the policy relevance of the virtual water trade. This study proposes a novel and integrated approach to evaluating virtual water content and flows endogenously, leveraging the advantages of Input-Output and Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) modeling methods. The quantification of the method is exemplified in the case of Uzbekistan (Central Asia), where water is a limited yet essential resource for sustainable economy and environmental systems. Specifically, this study examines the impacts of changes in economy-wide and sector-specific Total Factor Productivity (TFP) and water productivity on water uses, virtual water flows, and economic outcomes. The findings reveal that TFP improvements in livestock and fodder crop production and water productivity enhancements in gardening are recommendable options to constrain the net virtual water trade and enhance economic growth in Uzbekistan. The study also shows a high sensitivity of virtual water flows to technological changes, highlighting the importance of considering options for improving productivity when analyzing the potential of virtual water trade.";"2024-06-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624018262";"3";"Water Other"

To address this, there is a growing interest in organic aquaculture. In this study, we employed an attributional life cycle assessment (LCA) to analyze the environmental impacts of rainbow trout production, comparing conventional and organic practices in a model fish farm. Our life cycle impact assessment revealed that organic farming significantly reduced environmental impacts per tonne of trout in seven of the nine selected impact categories. Notably, freshwater ecotoxicity exhibited the most significant difference, with organic systems showing a 35% decrease. The only exceptions were freshwater eutrophication and water dependence, where organic production led to higher impacts per tonne of trout. In conventional farming, emissions amounted to 14 kg of P eq./tonne, whereas in organic farming, the emissions were slightly higher (15 kg of P eq./tonne). For water dependence, one tonne of trout production in the conventional system mobilized 128 103 m3 vs. 185 103 m3 in the organic system. The environmental benefits of organic production were even more marked when using a surface-based functional unit (m2y). We demonstrated the benefits of organic trout production from an environmental perspective. However, our findings highlight the caution needed when interpreting LCA comparisons of such production systems that can be highly influenced by methodological choices such as the functional unit used.";"2024-06-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262401744X";"2";"Water Other"

Enhanced reductive dechlorination (ERD) by emulsified vegetable oil (EVO) is an environmentally friendly, low-carbon and sustainable technology that effectively eliminates the threat from CAHs. To improve the permeability and bioavailability of EVO in the low-permeability substratum, nano-emulsified vegetable oil (nanoEVO) can be synthesized using a modified phase inversion composition method (MPIC) by increasing the emulsification temperature that reduces the shear force required for the formation of nanodroplets and the interfacial tension between the mixed phase and water. The emulsification temperature of 60 °C, the water content of 40–70%, the droplet diameter (DD) of nanoEVO prepared by MPIC is ∼200 nm, and had good monodispersion (≤0.2). The high molecular weight and low solubility of vegetable oil, and similar size of droplet make nanoEVO remains homogeneous after storage for > one year. NanoEVO can effectively biostimulate indigenous bacteria in CAHs-contaminated groundwater to dechlorinate 1,1,2-trichloroethane (1,1,2-TCA) to ethene via vinyl chloride (VC). The maximum dihaloelimination rate of 1,1,2-TCA was ∼66.06 μM·Cl−·day−1 and the maximum hydrogenolysis rate of VC was ∼35.67 μM·Cl−·day−1. NanoEVO effectively increased the relative abundance of Dehalococcoides from <0.10 to 9.61%. The abundances of Dhc 16S rRNA gene and dehalogenase gene vcrA increased by 102 and 103, respectively. Biostimulation shaped the structure of microbial communities and promoted hydrolytic acidification and anaerobic fermentation. Moreover, the syntrophic VFA-oxidizing bacteria participated in secondary fermentation and were closely correlated with H2 consumption metabolism. By providing carbon sources and maintaining an anaerobic environment with stable pH and ORP, nanoEVO biostimulated the hydrolytic acidification led by fermentative bacteria, secondary fermentation with syntrophic VFA-oxidizing bacteria and reductive dechlorination carried out by dechlorinator, thus greatly increasing the CAH-dechlorinating ability of indigenous microbial communities.

To quantitatively study the spatial equilibrium of water resources in China, this article proposed a three-stage hybrid model comprising regional assessment, spatiotemporal pattern analysis, and source apportionment. By adopting this approach, the study calculated the SEIWR (Spatial equilibrium index of water resources) and a comprehensive evaluation of the spatial balance level of water resources in China can be conducted. The results showed that (1) from 2008 to 2021, the SEIWR in mainland China had improved as a whole, but the level in Liaoning, Chongqing and other provinces and cities had declined; (2) in China, the SEIWR exhibited a distinct geographic pattern with high levels observed in the eastern and southern regions, while low levels were observed in the western and northern regions. The gap between the east and the west gradually narrowed during the study period. (3) There were zones with obvious differences, showing a certain spatial positive correlation aggregation effect. The central and eastern regions showed a large area of high-high cluster spatial patterns. (4) The SEIWR in East China, South China, and North China was greatly influenced by economic and social indicators.

Sankey diagrams have the potential to enhance the visualisation of resource flows. However, there is a knowledge gap regarding the effective use of Sankey diagrams to capture the water-energy nexus and circularity of water. This study focused on effectively utilizing Sankey diagrams to model the nexus of water and energy flows and to assess the circularity of water. A comprehensive literature review was conducted on major studies on water material flows and modelling. This was supported by a review of approaches for modelling circularity, which have evolved from the material circularity index. The newly developed framework in this paper models water resource flows at all stages of the water supply chain, embedding the nexus as an interaction and considering resource intensity and material circularity index at each node. A city-level case study in South Africa was then used to apply the recommendations, model circularity, and the water-energy nexus using Sankey diagrams. In terms of circularity, the results indicate that water loss in the study area was very high, accounting for up to 40% of the total water supply and the water recycle rate was still very low, ranging from 3% to 7%. In terms of the nexus, the residential sector was found to have the highest energy intensity for water supply, primarily due to energy demand for water heating. Exploring the use of renewable or solar energy for water heating will be of interest and value. The new approach presented in this study allows for the simultaneous consideration of objectives, enabling a more robust analysis of energy-effective water use and water circularity along the water supply chain.";"2024-06-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624018031";"8";"Water Other"

Based on a semi-structural questionnaire survey of 445 households in China's Weibei arid belt and extended Theory of Planned Behavior Model, a Structural Equation Model (SEM) was constructed to elucidate the age-related impact of water conservation knowledge, attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived control on water-saving behaviors. The results show that (1) youth group prioritizes personal hygiene and laundry activities whereas the elderly exhibit lower such requirements. (2) Water consumption varies significantly by age, with the elderly group consumes the least, averaging 62.26 L per capita per day (Lpcd), followed by the middle-aged group at 73.95 Lpcd, and the youth at the highest consumption rate of 84.60 Lpcd. (3) Influential factors on water conservation behavior differ substantially by age: Among the youth, water conservation behavior is strongly influenced by attitude in this domain (standardized path coefficient [SPC] = 0.32).

This study collected sediment layers from the typical hyporheic zone of the Weihe River, focusing on oxytetracycline (OTC) detected therein, and employed three types of MPs (polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) to establish various mediated adsorption systems. Through batch equilibrium adsorption experiments, morphological and spectroscopic characterizations combined with the impact of external environmental factors, the changes in OTC adsorption characteristics and the interactions before and after MPs mediation were systematically examined. The results indicate that MPs-mediated adsorption led to the formation of a rough, porous amorphous structure on the sediment surface, with potential internal hydrogen bonds. This exhibited an additional micropore diffusion step that delayed the adsorption kinetics equilibrium time, increased the isothermal maximum adsorption capacity along with desorption hysteresis effects, shifted thermodynamic enthalpy from physically dominated to semi-chemical adsorption participation, and resulted in an increased tendency towards disorder in entropy. The pH, ionic strength, and aging of MPs all affect the charge balance within the adsorption system, while MPs, OTC, and sediments can interact through the negative-charge-assisted hydrogen bond ((−)CAHB). The mediating effect of MPs stems from their role as receptors, facilitating the formation of (−)CAHB and thus crosslinking an amorphous structure available for OTC micropore filling. Compared to PE and PP, PMMA provides receptors through an additional free radical pathway, hence possessing a stronger mediating effect. These findings contribute to reevaluating the environmental fate of ATs and MPs from a new perspective, offering theoretical references for risk assessment and management of emerging pollutants.

This study investigates the dynamics of ARGs during AGS cultivation under anaerobic plug-flow (APM), anaerobic mixed-flow (AMM), and aerobic feeding mode (AFM). Significant differences (P < 0.05) are observed in the shifts of ARGs among these modes. The abundance of ARGs notably increases under all modes, with AMM exhibiting a lower average relative abundance (0.063 ± 0.025) compared to that of APM (0.148 ± 0.061) and AFM (0.147 ± 0.047). The observed variations in bacterial communities and the co-selection of ARGs among the feeding modes are likely influential factors contributing to the documented variations of ARGs. Furthermore, the study identifies tnpA and intl1 as key contributors to horizontal gene transfer (HGT) during APM and AFM operations. Additionally, a heightened level of HGT is observed in both APM and AFM, with a larger potential host range (12 hosts each) harboring ARGs, in contrast to AMM (4 hosts). The study highlights the pivotal role played by distinct bacterial communities and the co-selection of ARGs in ARG variations across feeding modes.

However, research on urban flood risk using methods like the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), further exploration of spatiotemporal variations is needed, especially within the context of karst mountainous urban clusters. This study focuses on Guiyang city within a karst mountainous urban cluster, investigating fractional vegetation cover (FVC), infiltration capacity, and urban flood risk. Methodologies encompass slope trend analysis, the utilization of the Google Earth Engine, and geographic detectors to assess the dynamics of FVC and infiltration capacity. AHP is employed to assign weights to infiltration capacity, land use and land cover (LULC), FVC, and elevation, culminating in the generation of flood risk maps through linear weighted overlay. The results showed that: (1) The average FVC in Guiyang City was 0.7440 in 21 years, with relatively low levels in the central and southern regions. The FVC increased by 0.21% per year from 2000 to 2020, driven mainly by land use change and human activities.

Instead, estimates of beneficial use or disposal of sludges have been periodically quantified through time- and resource-intensive surveys of facility operators. Simple methods to estimate annual sludge generation and disposal, informed by publicly available state-level data, were developed. The generation of drinking water treatment plant (DWTP) sludge was estimated using water supply data and a sludge generation factor (SGF) based on existing literature. A process-averaged SGF, 1.3% as wet-weight per gallons treated, resulted in 35–40 mmt dw sludge/year from 2000 to 2015, yielding 150 kg DWTP sludge dw/person-year.

However, the extent of their respective impacts on flood variability in the context of the combined effects remains to be explored. Therefore, analysis of the driveability of the water level is important for regional flood control. Land use data from 1985 to 2015 was used in this study to analyze the characteristics of the changes. General trends, abrupt variability, and persistence of rainfall, tide, and water level data from 1957 to 2018 were analyzed. The influence of rainfall, tide level factors and underlying surface on water level variation was analyzed qualitatively and the contribution of the three factors to water level variation was quantified. The results indicate that the most important directions of land-type transformation were the construction land and arable land. Within the rainfall sequence, only the 3d rainfall sequence exhibited a significant increasing trend, while both tide level and water levels showed significant increasing trends. The 3d rainfall sequence and tide level sequence are significantly positively correlated with water level sequences, whereas among the underlying surface factors, only construction land and unused land are significantly positively correlated with water levels.

Moreover, it is a crucial requirement for achieving the sustained provision of ecosystem services and sustainable human development. This study quantified spatial and temporal changes of ecosystem services in different land use policy zones of Shaanxi, assessed the marginal effects of drivers using the random forest, and explained the relationships within ecosystem services by the geographically weighted regression model. The results showed that water yield (WY) increased in the Economic Development Zone, food Production (FP), water yield (WY), carbon storage (CS), soil conservation (SC), and habitat quality (HQ) improved in the Ecological Enhancement Zone and Ecological Restoration Zone. In contrast, water yield (WY) and soil conservation (SC) in the Ecological Conservation Zone decreased from 2000 to 2020. Changes in the dominant factors in different policy zones affected ecosystem services in a non-stationary manner. For example, the initial increase in construction land ratio would lead to complex and dramatic effects on multiple ecosystem services. Differences in the most significant factors and their respective marginal effects led to disparities in transformations of trade-offs and synergies between ecosystem services in different land use policy zones.

However, the current understanding of the seepage-creep coupling effects on coal pillar dam behavior is unclear, necessitating targeted research. Therefore, This Paper conducted experiments on coal pillar dam samples under various osmotic pressures to study their creep behavior and long-term strength. The results indicate that seepage fluids, with their softening, dissolving, lubricating, and flow carrier effects, significantly notably promote the creep behavior of coal samples. Viscoelastic creep in coal decreases with increasing osmotic pressure, whereas the viscoplastic creep strain increases with increasing time and stress. This Paper proposes employing the critical stress at the steady state viscoplastic creep rate threshold as the long-term strength of coal.

Existing research on ecological reservoir operation focused more on the effectiveness of operation redesign for ecology improvement, but less discussion on why they are eco-friendly. In this paper, the reservoir operation mechanisms targeting lake ecology are explored from three perspectives: ecological impoundment strategy, dominant characteristics of ecology and conservation tradeoffs, and critical parameters of the rule curves. Therefore, a reservoir operation framework, which couples the lake hydrological response model and multi-objective optimization model, is developed in this study. This framework is to maximize the water conservation and lake ecology benefits, assessing the latter by ecological reliability and ecological water shortage rate. Taking the Three Gorges Reservoir and Dongting Lake as the case study, operation rule curves are optimized for different impoundment strategies. The results indicate that impoundment with early storage time and slow storage rate can improve the ecological reliability and ecological water shortage by 9.90 % and 16.39 % than conventional operation. The ecological objectives are weakly competitive or synergistic when impounding fast, but strong competitive when impounding slow. Meanwhile, as the storage rate declines, the ecological improvement causes a slight decrease in power generation and a significant decrease in water supply. Finally, the crucial parameters of the rule curves are explored and appropriate values are recommended for different ecological preferences.

Since 2015, sponge city (SC) pilot construction in China has highlighted the importance of urban water systems, but has paid insufficient attention to extreme and long-term climate change risks. This paper aims to provide a new method for evaluating the urban water system climate resilience (UWSCR), classify China cities in combination with climate hazards, conduct case studies on SC pilots, and propose ways to improve the UWSCR in SCs. Firstly, Taking heavy rain and drought as hazards, an evaluation index system of UWSCR is established, including engineering resilience (ENR), ecological resilience (ECR) and evolutionary resilience (EVR). A combination model based on the analytic hierarchy process and entropy weight method is used to measure the UWSCR of 27 SC pilot cities and 253 non-pilot cities at or above the prefecture level in China. Secondly, coordinating hazard index and UWSCR index, cities are divided into four types. The results show that the ENR and EVR of SC pilots exhibited an increasing trend from 2010 to 2020 and were greater than those of non-pilots. Among the four types, Resilient Cities and Low Risk Cities with high climate resilience (CR) were mainly distributed in the eastern and central regions of China. High Risk Cities and Vulnerable Cities with low CR were mostly distributed in the central and western regions. Among the cities of high CR, SC pilots accounted for 63.0% of the pilot samples, while non-pilots only accounted for 26.5% of the non-pilot samples. Finally, this paper analyzes the typical cases of SC pilots, and puts forward some suggestions, such as considering the UWSCR systematically and holistically, improving the ECR of UWSCR, making medium-term to long-term adaptation planning and providing differentiated policy support. The originality of this work is to identify four types of cities from the perspective of UWSCR and provide reference for improving the CR of SCs.

Due to the strong coupling relationship between them, the independent effect on field crops is hard to distinguish clearly. In this study, taking Yongji Sub-irrigation District (YJSID) in Inner Mongolia of China as case study, the sorting bins method and GeoDetector were employed to try to disentangle relative effects of soil moisture and salinization on crop development and yield during growing seasons in 2021–2022. The regional soil water content (SWC) and soil salt content (SSC) were firstly mapped and validated through the inverse density weighted method and random forest model. Separated effects of SWC and SSC on solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), gross primary productivity (GPP), and crop yield were then calculated and presented. Results showed that low SWC inhibited SIF and the ratio of GPP to SIF (GPP/SIF) in SSC bins, as their values declined among 52.989% and 71.801% of YJSID. In SWC bins, the increase of SIF and GPP/SIF covered 91.356% and 50.087% of the area, indicating that low SSC could bring out higher SIF and GPP/SIF for field crops. Relative importance assessment suggested that SSC posed greater impacts than SWC on SIF and GPP/SIF in YJSID with the area of 77.188% and 59.628%, respectively. To the SWC effects, it performed greater for the C3 crops (sunflower, wheat, interplant, others) than the C4 plant (maize) in SIF, while reversely in GPP/SIF. The q value calculated from GeoDetector also indicated that SSC had greater effects than SWC on crop yield. Increased SSC tended to reduce grain yield with linear relationships, and the severity was bigger for maize than sunflower. These results would contribute to further understanding of the key processes involved in soil water-salt interactions and dealing with them better in agricultural practice.

In this study, an environmentally friendly alternative was investigated that could eliminate water waste and salt usage, as well as reducing chemical consumption. This method, which employs a hydrophobic organic chemical/water two-phase dyeing system, solely involves fiber swelling, dye dissolution, and the use of alkaline agents. By substituting the water required for heat and mass with an organic chemical, 71.43% dye reduction can be achieved in dye consumption compared to traditional water-based dyeing method. Benefiting from the natural affinity between dyes and cotton fibers, without any interaction with hydrophobic organic chemicals, reactive dye can diffuse into the fiber surface, which can achieve above 98% dye uptake and 90% fixation rate. The K/S value of the dyed cotton fabric is much higher than that of conventional water bath at the same dye concentration, and it is the highest when the water content is 120 %. Moreover, the uniform distribution of dye and the color fastness of the dyed fabric are comparable to traditional water-based dyeing. Due to the influence of intermolecular forces, the aggregation of dye is changed to varying degrees in different hydrophilic and hydrophobic cotton fiber dyeing systems, which further influences the dyeing quality. This study not only improves the utilization of dye but achieves salt-free, no wastewater emission and reduces the dyeing cost, providing an economical and sustainable dyeing method for the industrial dyeing of cotton fabric.

To promote the intensive use of water resources, suppress groundwater overexploitation and force high water consumption companies to save water, the Chinese government implemented “interim measures for expanding the reform of the water resources tax” in 2017. We represent water-saving innovation performance as the number of authorized green patents promoted by the water resources tax. By selecting the annual reports and patent data of 818 high water consumption listed companies and 727 nonhigh water consumption listed companies in pilot and nonpilot provinces, we use double difference and triple difference methods to verify the influence of the water resources tax policy on promoting the water-saving innovation performance of high water consumption companies in pilot provinces. Then, the parallel trend test, PSM-DDD robustness test and placebo test are used to demonstrate the rigor and effectiveness of this study, where all possible factors that interfere with the results of the study are excluded. In addition, the heterogeneity analysis shows that the water resource tax policy is more significant for promoting the water-saving innovation performance of nonstate-owned and small and medium-sized companies than it is for promoting that of state-owned and large-scale companies.

The results showed that compared with DOM, POM accelerated biomass growth and improved the settling performance of the sludge. However, concerning pollutant removal, ABGS cultured with DOM exhibited high TN and TP removal efficiency. The analysis of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), indicated that the presence of POM primarily facilitated the production of loosely bound EPS (LB-EPS), whereas the presence of DOM promoted the secretion of tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS). Notably, carbon sources influenced the secretion of different signal molecules. ABGS cultured with POM exhibited higher concentrations of 3-oxo-C8-HSL than that cultivated with DOM, while DOM resulted in the production of more C8-HSL and C6-HSL. Microbial communities analysis revealed that the dominant bacteria in the mature ABGS cultured with different carbon sources were Plasticicumulans, while the predominant algal genus displayed notable diversity. Further investigations into functional genes suggested that the nitrification process (hao) and the denitrification process (nir, nar) were greatly enhanced in the presence of DOM.

However, as a limited rational economic person, considering their economic benefit, different involvers in China's South-to-North Water Transfer Project show different types of preference relations and make different action decisions as well as play conflicts with each other, which have a negative effect on ecological environmental governance. To overcome above-described shortcomings, heterogeneous preferences are integrated into graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR) to resolve ecological environment governance conflict of water resources. Specifically, first, four different structures of preference expression, including preference orderings, utility functions, multiplicative preferences, and additive preferences, are used to represent decision-maker's (DM's) preference information over states. Then, a novel preference ranking method is designed to calculate the ordinal preferences over all states by using matrix representation. Based on this, a set of heterogeneous stability definitions is proposed in GMCR to describe human diversified choice and behavior in detail, and it is applied to the ecological environment governance conflict of water resources in China's South-to-North Water Transfer Project. The heterogeneous stability analysis result showed that incentive policies used by water resources agencies can effectively encourage local governments and enterprises to actively participate in the ecological environment governance, and promote the ecological environment governance conflict to evolve into a state of equilibrium.

Urban-scale WEF nexus research is very different from macroscale (global or national) research. There is a need for quantitative optimization of several economic sectors, as well as spatial heterogeneity of resource endowments, to develop policies that are distinctive for different levels of endowments. Currently, China is implementing Territorial Spatial Planning (TSP) at all administrative levels throughout the country. Its theoretical basis is to realize the overall management of urban ecological protection land, urban expansion, and industrial growth by measuring the resource carrying capacity and land development suitability of each plot. This provides an opportunity to explore the interconnections between WEF nexus at urban scale by examining the wide range of urban resource availability. Here, we propose the WEF-TSP framework, which helps to realize the multi-objective development needs of regional ecological protection, urban expansion, agricultural development, and energy production in a certain city and provides a decision-making basis for future urban land spatial planning. Ordos, a city in China recognized for its significant energy reserves, has been selected as the subject of a case study. Combined with the spatial heterogeneity of Ordos's resource endowment and focusing on the strong constraints of water resources and ecological protection, this study explores the urban land spatial layout scheme of Ordos in 2030 under different energy development scenarios.

However, aquatic plants do not necessarily function well to control P release from urban lakes with high internal sediment P loading. To identify an effective method, aquatic plants (Vallisneria spiralis) and lanthanum-modified clay (LMC) were combined or used individually to remediate sediment P of various concentrations (low, moderate, high, and extremely high levels). Our results showed that the combination can efficiently control the P concentration in water columns and pore water, and inhibited sediment P release regardless of internal P level. At low and moderate internal P levels, Vallisneria spiralis alone exerts a similar control effect on pore water P and P flux compared with the combination method. However, there was 51% less reduction of P flux in Vallisneria spiralis treatment compared with combination treatment at high or extremely high level. Aquatic plants can only efficiently reduce sediment mobile P proportion (6%–7%) at low and moderate level. By contrast, LMC efficiently reduced the sediment mobile P proportion (13%–21%) and concurrently increased inert P fractions (HCl–P) at all investigated sediment P levels. The combination of chemical and ecological methods integrated all the advantages and can overcome the impact of high sediment internal P loading. This novel remediation method offers high application prospects in eutrophic urban lakes affected by severe internal P pollution.

In this work, using air-lift internal circulation reactor we studied the effect of suspended solids on the autotrophic nitrogen removal process by adding 600–900 mg/L suspended solids from digested swine wastewater to the influent (R–SS). The results showed that during the formation of autotrophic nitrogen removal granular sludge, suspended solids containing Ca, Mg, Cu P, and Pb can enter the granular sludge, occupy the ecological niche of anammox bacteria, lead to loose internal structure, and damage the internal anoxic environment. It then reduces the settling performance in the R–SS, causes heavy wash-out of granular sludge from the R–SS reactor (2.5 times more than the control, R–CK), and finally reduces the maximum nitrogen removal rate of the autotrophic nitrogen removal process from 5.16 kg N/m3/d to 4.31 kg N/m3/d. Meanwhile, the metagenomic analysis showed that suspended solids reduce the relative abundance of reads from key nitrogen genes of anammox bacteria yet increases reads from both nitrite-oxidizing and denitrifying bacteria, especially nir and nor genes. Further analysis of 16 highly abundant genomes assembled via metagenomics showed that suspended solids decrease the relative abundance of Kuenenia_seed103, an anammox bacterium, from 13.36% (R–CK) to 11.03% (R–SS). Since suspended solids can act as a carbon source for denitrifiers to compete with nitrite or nitric oxide with anammox bacteria, the denitrifier community has progressed from a simple denitrifier consisting of only one or two denitrification steps (nar or nos) that acts as an ammonia and nitrite sink to a complete one that directly reduces nitrite to nitrogen gas.

In this study, we investigated the effects of pyraclostrobin@chitosan-based nanoparticles (NPs.PYR) on microbial communities in a pond. NPs.PYR significantly impacted the abundance of microbial communities in the pond, compared with the commercial pesticide suspensions. We employed Chlorella sp. as a representative microorganism to explain this phenomenon and found that the NPs and NPs.PYR treatments induced a rapid decrease in the abundance of Chlorella sp. This phenomenon can be attributed to the electrostatic interaction between the NPs and microorganisms, along with the affinity of the microorganisms’ extracellular polymers to the chitosan-based NPs, resulting in the cosettlement of the microorganisms with these NPs. The NPs.PYR migrated from the overlying water to the sediment, decreasing the PYR concentration in the overlying water. The mortality of zebrafish specimens exposed to NPs.PYR was significantly lower than that of the specimens exposed to pyraclostrobin suspension concentrate. These results suggest that the prepared chitosan-based nanopesticide tends to aggregate with microorganisms, leading to cosettlement and reduced pesticide levels in the overlying water, thus enhancing the safety of nontarget animals.

This study proposes a novel approach to assess environmental flow regime in which the fish biodiversity index is simulated in the structure of the environmental flow assessment for protecting the fish biodiversity values in the case study. Due to considerable impact of water quality parameters as well as physical flow parameters, two combined physical flow and water quality indices were considered as the inputs of simulating fish biodiversity index. Adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) as well as hydraulic simulation were applied to simulate combined indices of physical flow and water quality. Moreover, a multiple linear regression (MLR) model was utilized for simulating the fish biodiversity index. Due to necessity of simulating natural flow regime in the representative river reach, soil and water assessment tool as a known hydrological tool was applied as well. According to evaluation indices of the case study, ANFIS model as well as SWAT and MLR are reliable to assess environmental flow considering the fish biodiversity. The minimum environmental flow in the study area was assessed 40% of mean annual flow in which the difference between fish biodiversity index between the natural flow and environmental flow is less than 10%. However, significant improvement of water quality is a prerequisite before implementing the proposed environmental flow regime. High computational complexities is one of the weaknesses of the proposed method.";"2024-04-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624012824";"3";"Water Other"

Currently, there are limited studies on the global value chain at the sub-national level, with most focusing on virtual water trade (VWT) characteristics between two trading partners, without integrating VWT into the global value chain and overlooking significant cooperation among participants. Here, we characterize the international division of GVC and VWT patterns covering 194 regions (31 regions in China and 163 countries) around the world in 2020, and then examine the inequality between virtual water (VW) and value-added (VA) transfer from both environmental and economic perspectives, focusing on the sub-national scale of China. Our results show that in terms of water consumption responsibilities, considerable heterogeneity can be seen in different regions across China. Furthermore, relying solely on the export of primary products for economic development will lead to inequality in trade between countries. In this study, we trace the characteristics of VWT, taking into account the participation and contribution of regions in numerous GVC linkages. In addition, to make our policy implications more targeted, we refine the study resolution to the sub-national scale. Our results suggest that countries should prioritize consumer responsibility in GVC, reduce the drawbacks of trade barriers, and dispassionately exploit the economic and environmental advantages of water resources.

Here, we investigated the physiological, transcriptomic, metabolomic responses, and organelle changes in submerged macrophyte, Vallisneria denseserrulata (V. denseserrulata), to single/combined exposure to NPs and As. Our results showed that co-exposure alters physiological traits in V. denseserrulata including chlorophyll, sugars, proteins, malondialdehyde, and antioxidant enzymes. The presence of NPs exacerbated As distribution 36.2–47.2% higher than the control in plant tissues, thus enhancing combined pollution to plants. Integration of physiological traits and differentially expressed genes via weighted correlation network analysis implicated stress-responsive candidate modules related to key enzymes, such as ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase, alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, phosphofructokinase-1, and phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. Metabolomics profiling identified carbohydrates, amino acids, organic acids, and fatty acids. Conjoint transcriptome and metabolome analysis revealed that photosynthetic systems, energy conversion, and oxidative and antioxidant regulation are the key defensive response mechanisms for V. denseserrulata under NPs-As co-exposure. Taken together, our multi-omics study provided new molecular insights into submerged macrophytes tolerance mechanisms against combined NPs and As toxicity, highlighting potential targets for stress mitigation and biomonitoring in contaminated aquatic ecosystems.

This paper presented a sustainable treatment process for extracting xylan from sugarcane bagasse by phosphoric acid-based porous geopolymers containing sodium (Na-PAG) under mild hydrothermal conditions. The experimental investigation showed that the maximum xylan relative extraction rate reached 25.9% when the hydrothermal reaction time was 4 h, the hydrothermal temperature was 150 °C, the pH was 2, the mass ratio of bagasse fiber to Na-PAG was 3, the mass ratio of water to bagasse fiber was 8, and the bagasse fiber meshes were 40–80. Compared to the difference in hemicellulose content before and after the reaction using the Van Soest method, the selectivity of Na-PAG for hemicellulose was as high as 89.32%. The high acidity required for hemicellulose depolymerization was reduced by the “acid slow-release” property of Na-PAG. The black liquor obtained after separating xylan and Na-PAG can also be used for repeated experiments. The treatment process enables the reuse of solid and liquid waste, which is crucial for sugar-paper co-production and clean production.

Wastewater containing NH3–N serious affects aquatic life and the operations of effluent treatment plants. In this study, the strategy of reducing NH3–N released into tannery wastewater, uses non-ammonia deliming agent-solid dicarboxylic acid (malonic acid) to replace the conventional deliming agent (ammonium sulfate). Utilizing a laboratory experiment, a pilot scale test was carried out and found to be almost comparable with the former experimental work. The generated delimed wastewater, delimed pelts, and manufactured crust leathers were subjected to various physicomechanical analyses. Results revealed that the reductions of NH3–N, TKN, and hydroxyproline amounted, respectively, to 98.78%, 88.69%, and 26.9%, compared to conventional deliming agents. The other pollutants, namely TDS, BOD, COD, and EC were significantly reduced. The physicomechanical properties of the crust leathers met the standard requirements. SEM images of delimed pelt and crust leathers revealed a similar fiber structure. The wastewater emitted during deliming with malonic acid is probably an easier way to conduct effluent treatment by reducing nitrogen pollution. This investigation is a novel approach to finding a viable technology that can satisfy the need for modern leather manufacturing being done in environmentally friendly ways.

In this study, we combined DGT, high-throughput sequencing, and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) techniques for the first time to investigate the effects of flood and ebb tide on As transformation and mobility in a typical coastal tidal flat wetland by laboratory experiments. In the flood-tide stage, more As was released into the water solution, and As(III) concentration in water solution was notably higher (51 μg/L) than in the ebb-tide stage, especially in SA (sodium acetate addition) treatment. As-methylation also occurred in this stage. The release of As was attributed to the reductive dissolution of amorphous and crystalline Fe oxides bound As induced by microbes. Fusibacter, Sva1033, Bradyrhizobium, Ralstonia, and Desulfobacter were primarily involved in the reduction of As, Fe, and S. The copy numbers of arsC were 20–148 times higher than arrA, suggesting that the detoxification reduction pathway was the primary mechanism of direct As-reduction in the flood-tide stage. However, 2-D high-resolution DGT techniques revealed that the concentrations of As(III) and total As in pore water of sediments in the ebb-tide stage were higher than those in the flood-tide stage. The detected aioA gene indicated that As was oxidized in the sediment surface, resulting in As stabilization by crystalline iron minerals, whereas more As(III) were accumulated in pore water. The reduction pathway mediated by arrA may play a prominent role in the ebb-tide stage. This study provides new insights into As release processes in coastal wetlands in seawater environments, which further deepens our understanding of As biogeochemical cycling behavior in different natural environments.

Converting sludge wastes into ceramsite by sintering treatment is a promising strategy for sludge treatment. This paper summarizes existing processes and technologies for regenerating ceramsite from sludge wastes. The synthesis process including raw material pretreatment, sludge characteristics analysis, batching, mixing and molding, drying and preheating, sintering and cooling is discussed. Then, the effects of additives, sintering temperature and time, and sludge content on the preparation and properties of sludge-based ceramsite are summarized. Integrating mechanistic insights and different physicochemical properties highlighted the understanding of the different applications (environmental remediation and architecture ingredients) of sludge-based ceramsite. High-temperature sintering sludge-based ceramsite exhibited excellent performance for the removal of contaminants due to the high porosity, large surface area, and good biocompatibility. Besides, the sludge-based ceramsite could also be used as concrete aggregate and asphalt mixtures due to its high strength, thermal insulation, and seismic resistance. Finally, the challenges and proposals for sludge-based ceramsite are proposed. This paper can provide a theoretical basis and guidance for the preparation and application of sludge-based ceramsite.

Nevertheless, the phenomena and mechanism involved have not been well explored. Here the performance of Chlorococcum sphacosum in treating wastewater with high concentrations of organic carbon was studied by coupling calcium ion concentration regulation (adding CaCl2 and free Ca2+ chelator EGTA) via physicochemical and transcriptomic analysis. It was found that photosynthesis and nutrients removal were suppressed and lipid accumulation was enhanced as the microalga was used to treat wastewater with high concentrations of organic carbon (more than 1500 mg/L). Simultaneously, antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT and POD) activity and calcium signaling-related protein (CaM, CDPK, and Ca2+-ATPase) content rose implying that the microalga was in a state of stress and calcium was involved in stress response. It was found that EGTA treatment further weakened the performance of microalgal photosynthesis and nutrients removal. However, the supplementation of Ca2+ had the opposite effect. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Ca2+ strengthened the heterotrophic decomposition process of carbon (up-regulating the gene expression related to glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle) and inhibited lipid accumulation (down-regulating lipid synthesis) via Ca2+ signalings transduction. Briefly, Ca2+ alleviated the stress of high concentration of organic carbon and strengthened the performance treating the corresponding wastewater.

Altered Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) due to urbanization, deforestation, and agriculture triggers many environmental issues to eco-hydrological systems, which are already profoundly impacted by shifting climate patterns. The Upper Black Warrior River Basin in Birmingham, Alabama, is a prime example of how converting forests into urban areas impairs water quality and increases surface runoff due to impermeable surfaces. This study delved into the temporal and spatial alterations in eco-hydrologically relevant flows, considering individual and combined climate change scenarios and LULC transformation. The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) served as the modeling platform, calibrated (2016–2022) and validated (2011–2015) at a daily time scale. Five distinct scenarios were crafted to portray eco-hydrology's past, present, and future responses (runoff and river nutrients) to climate and LULC variations. The model demonstrated strong performance for discharge and predicted increased runoff in future periods, which is attributed to the anticipated warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers characterized by more intense rainfall events. Notably, the study unveiled the adverse impact of climate change on monthly nitrates leaching into surface runoff, with the lowest levels predicted during May to September coinciding with reduced precipitation. Conversely, human activity positively impacts runoff, especially in FMC, which has a higher deforestation rate (42.8%) and increased runoff compared to VC. The study also emphasized the significant link between flow and nutrient concentration, highlighting the dominant role of nonpoint sources in contributing to these inputs. These findings have significant implications for local stakeholders, necessitating considering the potential consequences of integrated climate change and urbanization on eco-hydrology. Effective management strategies, such as improved land use practices and reduced nutrient leaching, must be implemented to minimize these impacts.

Herein, we studied the impacts of carbon supplements on halophilic microbial cultures as a process intensification way towards bioenergy recovery from saline wastewater. Three additives, i.e., powdered activated carbon, multiwall carbon nanotubes and graphene, were examined. Two sets of parallel batch experiments were conducted using archaea-free (for dark fermentation) and mixed (for anaerobic digestion) halophilic cultures at different supplement doses. Adding 30 mg/L of graphene and 100 mg/L of powdered activated carbon exhibited the maximum improvements in dark fermentation (H2-production) and anaerobic digestion (biogas production), i.e., ∼28% and ∼27% over the control, respectively. This underscored the dose-dependent impact of different-sized carbon amendments. Both the electron transport system activity and extracellular polymeric substances were improved with all amendments, indicating a stimulated electron transfer flux. However, distinct bacterial compositions were identified when using mixed and archaea-free cultures along with indicators for direct interspecies electron transfer establishment in the presence of archaea. Beyond this, such findings also supported the expanded role of conductive additives on H2-producing bacteria, including Clostridium.

Insights from the Yellow River, China ";" Understanding changes in human water utilization under the policy environment of the national top-down water unified allocation and regulation (TWAR) is crucial for promoting river health, sustainable resource utilization, and high-quality socioeconomic development along the whole Yellow River, a congenitally water-deficient river in China. This study assessed the TWAR policy effects on the total/sectoral/per capita water uses using the canonical difference-in-difference (DID) model, synthetic control method (SCM), and generalized synthetic control method (GSCM). The net effects of TWAR were assumed to be spatially heterogeneous and associated with variations in water-conserving efficiency, described by two indicators: water-conserving irrigation (WCI) and industrial recycled water (IRW). The suitable threshold intervals of WCI and IRW for benefiting decelerating water utilization were analyzed using a linear mediating effect (ME) model and panel smoothing transformation regression (PSTR) model, to explain the rebound effect in water use under the impact of the prevailing TWAR. The results show that TWAR initially had sustained positive effects on curbing water use growth, with the highest contribution to per capita agricultural water use in the lower section and high-quota region of the Yellow River Basin, but these effects decreased after a decade. Only when the WCI shifted within the threshold interval [0.283, 0.771] and the IRW did not exceed 0.962 could TWAR restrain water use. Emphasizing the conservation-oriented improvement of water use efficiency may necessitate extra attention to regions where water-conserving practices already reach high levels beyond the maximum WCI or IRW thresholds.

However, the relative and cumulative impacts of diverse policies on ESs and their trade-offs in different periods are still unclear and need further differentiation. The western Jilin Province, China was taken as a case study, and actual LULC conversions associated with policy implementation rules were selected to disentangle the relative and cumulative impacts of diverse policies on food- and water-related ESs and their trade-offs in the historical (2000–2010) and recent (2010–2020) periods. Policies that have the greatest impact on ESs trade-offs at county scale in different periods were further identified. The results showed that food production improved the most (203.50%), but habitat quality (−7.79%) and water purification (−7.61%) decreased the most in the food security plan (FSP) during 2000–2020.

A pretreatment method of alkaline pulping with KOH and NaOH was proposed to achieve the high feed concentration for continuous reactor and macromolecular simplification for barrier reduction of conversion. In this study, bark as an example of lignocellulosic biomass, whose 30 wt% and 40 wt% slurries with favorable rheology and stability, was prepared by alkaline pulping successfully. The minimum alkali consumption of NaOH and KOH pulping for 30 wt% and 40 wt% were 11%–14%, 16%–20%, and 16%–21%, 23%–28%, respectively. The most economical conditions were 180 °C and 24% KOH addition. All slurries prepared by NaOH and KOH at 180 and 200 °C could satisfy the industrial standard of coal-water slurry, and only 3–5 times higher than water viscosity. The bark macromolecules were restructured due to the hydrolysis of cellulose and lignin by breaking down the hydrogen bond and ether bond with trivial hydrocarbon matrix loss. The scattered crystal growth facilitated the uniform premixing of bark and water. Meanwhile, a surface particle charges potential increase leading to a heightened repulsive force by alkaline pulping furtherly enhanced the premixing effect. Additionally, metal ions could be deposited onto the bark surface during alkaline pulping. The chemical modification leading by alkaline pulping achieved the premixing of feedstock and water to form bark slurry. The conversion barrier was decreased to fulfill the ordered conversion, and 95.66% gasification efficiency for 40 wt% bark slurry was displayed at 600 °C with a preheated water of 6. Phenolic compounds and hydrocarbons were the most dominant components in liquid products. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in liquid products were detected at 620 °C with a preheated water of 4. The functional groups of organic matter in the slurry were significantly converted into the gas phase, and lattice oxygen was produced in the solid product. The alkali recovery was 65% at the optimal gasification condition, and achieved the maximum of 80% at 580 °C.

Taking the Momoge Wetland in the Songnen Plain as an example, we innovatively combined the “source-transfer-sink” theory with landscape patterns, topographic factors, and their impacts on wetland water quality. Using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), our research quantifies and models the relationships among various environmental factors. This approach reveals how landscape patterns influence pollutant migration and water quality at a micro-scale. Our findings suggest that a 700-m buffer zone is most effective in capturing the fluctuations in water quality in arid wetlands, which is crucial for wetland management practices. We identified the main pollution sources in the Momoge Wetland, including sediment (21.60%), vegetation (24.94%), livestock and crop-related non-point sources (41.21%), and hydrodynamic factors such as water diversion (12.25%). In pollutant migration, land use emerged as the most significant factor affecting water quality (56.64%), followed by landscape patterns (25.54%). Notably, our study finds that grasslands are essential for water purification, and a uniform distribution of landscape patches significantly improves water quality. This research marks a significant stride in understanding and optimizing landscape patterns to enhance water quality in micro swamp wetlands. The insights gained are invaluable for the protection of these ecosystems and promoting their ecological value functions, providing a reference point for future wetland conservation and management strategies.

Official data access and on-site monitoring were first conducted to investigate the local meteorological and hydrological situation and current pollution load. Based on investigation results, a water environment model, with a relative error within 35%, was constructed to simulate the water quality of the river basin surrounding the mine under different scenarios. According to simulation results, the rainstorm-flat-water period was the most disadvantageous scenario, with a contamination concentration 1.7–4.4 times higher than that under moderate rain-flat-water period. Moreover, the model derived that the maximum permissible input of pollution load (Fe) from four regions comprising the mine were 1600 mg/s, 161 mg/s, 1625 mg/s and 153 mg/s, respectively. Further tightened as governance requirement on the basis of derivation results, 250.00 mg/s, 126.79 mg/s, 253.50 mg/s and 112.85 mg/s were finally determined as governance objectives of pollution load for these four mineral regions. In addition, the contribution of single governance of these four regions was also analyzed. Results showed that Fe concentration at outlets of the river basin still exceeded standards when governing singly. In short, this study provided an innovative path for determining governance objectives of abandoned mines, which helps the scientific and efficient remediation of mines in subsequent steps.

However, the precise understanding of the physical water consumption and virtual water flows associated with diversified diets remains unclear. This study estimated the dietary water footprints (WFs), interprovincial virtual water flows, followed by assessing the unsustainable blue WF and water scarcity footprint (WSF) in China over 2015–2019. Rural and urban food intake, waste, and differences between eating at home and out were considered. The findings reveal that China’s dietary patterns have gradually strayed from recommended guidelines, with an overconsumption of cereals and inadequate intake of dairy products and potatoes. Despite a decrease, both unsustainable blue WF and WSF remained significant, measuring 249.61 Gm3 and 807.77 Gm3 H2O-eq, respectively, in 2019. Notably, water-scarce regions still accounted for a substantial portion of unsustainable virtual blue water exports. The diet related virtual water reallocation can offset the water savings on the crop production side.

To study the characteristics of soil water-salt in the typical plant communities in the ecological buffer zone of the arid lake wetland, three zones were selected lakeshore as the starting point in Stone House, Bird Island, and Duck Bay management stations of Lake Ebinur wetland, August 2016 and 2017. These zones, including the waterward radiation zone, the water level variation zone, and the landward radiation zone, to investigate the variation patterns of soil water-salt in different zones and soil depths (0–5, 5–10, 10–20, 20–40, 40–60 cm). The results showed that: the soil pH in different plant communities in zones were all alkaline with weak varianbility. Soil moisture and total salt content were moderately variable. According to the Xinjiang saline-alkali classification standards, soils in the three zones were classified as non-salinized soil to mildly salinized soil, heavily salinized soil to saline soil, and non-salinized soil to heavily salinized soil, respectively; soil pH and moisture content in different plant communities of the zones tended to increase along with soil deepens and salt content decreased.

To address these challenges, this study introduces the novel application of polyoxometalates (POMs) in THP to achieve sludge deep dewatering at lower temperatures. Specifically, under the optimal conditions with a POMs dosage of 1.0 mM/g VSS and a THP temperature of 140 °C, a reduction of 30.36%, 88.31%, and 55.04% in W C , SRF, and CST, respectively, was achieved compared to 20-RS-THP. Further analysis revealed that both the acidity and the biological effect of POMs played the dominant role in enhancing sludge dewatering. Spectroscopic techniques and molecular simulations revealed changes in protein structure during THP induced the POMs-proteins interaction. Results revealed that at lower THP temperatures (<80 °C), POMs induced protonation of functional groups in amino acid residues, strengthening electrostatic interactions. As temperatures increased (80–140 °C), more binding sites in hydrophilic amino acid residues became available for hydrogen bonding with POMs. This interaction led to structural changes in proteins, facilitating water liberation and the formation of sludge colloidal aggregates with improved drainage channels. However, at higher temperatures (140–180 °C), the exposure of hydrophobic sites, the loss of hydrophilic amino acids, and the occurrence of the Maillard reaction in proteins partially offset POMs' binding effects. Moreover, the development of magnetized POMs-based materials may offer sustainability and economic benefits for POMs-based sludge treatment and disposal technologies.

However, there remains a need to better comprehend the nuanced and seasonal nonlinear relationship between consumer goods and water pollution, which currently obstructs essential consumption adjustments aimed at reducing water pollution. This study selected an effective machine learning model Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) with SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to assess the nonlinear relationship between consumer goods and water pollution during flood and non-flood seasons within the Yangtze River Economic Belt from 2013 to 2022, Baidu Index of consumer goods were used to represent the potential consumption level (PCL). The findings revealed the following: (1) During flood seasons, hydroelectricity and the PCL of furniture and cultural goods emerged as factors driving water pollution reduction. Conversely, GDP, PCL of communication devices, and beverages played significant roles in exacerbating water pollution. During non-flood seasons, the drivers for reducing water pollution included GDP, income gap and PCL of cultural goods. Meanwhile, PCL of cars, western medicine and oil became pivotal drivers for exacerbating water pollution. (2) Concerning consumption structure during flood and non-flood seasons, maintaining consumption levels of costume industrial goods, cultural, sports and health goods and transportation and accommodation goods below 66.71%, 77.66% and 79.61% respectively of their average PCL appeared beneficial in reducing water pollution. During flood seasons, consumption levels of cars and furniture below 85.69% and 91.46% respectively of their average PCL were associated with reduced water pollution. During non-flood seasons, consumption levels of cars and oil below 82.95% and 71.28% respectively of their average PCL could help reduce water pollution. (3) The proportion of hydroelectricity generation exceeding 2% and 3% respectively during flood and non-flood seasons helped in reducing water pollution. Moreover, GDP per capita surpassing 2388.82 and 2075.78 respectively during flood and non-flood season was preferable for reducing water pollution. These findings deepened our understanding of the nonlinear relationship and identify promising consumer goods and their consumption structure that could effectively aid in reducing water pollution from a consumption perspective.

In this paper, a novel traceability method is therefore developed to explore causes of unstable wastewater for optimizing CtEG process, which is beneficial to promote the cleaner production of the whole CtEG. The steady-state CtEG process is simulated firstly, followed by dynamic simulation to generate datasets under six conditions. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network (CNN) is trained based on above datasets to classify the causes of high COD. The granger causality test (GCT), attention mechanism (AM), and gate recurrent unit (GRU) are integrated to accurately localize the cause from part to unit and then to calculate influence weights of variables towards COD. Based on the above research, the causal traceability network for COD in CtEG wastewater is used for process optimization with effective wastewater reduction.

As one of China's main grain-producing regions, the North China Plain (NCP) with dominant grain-oriented cropping system is faced with severe challenges for agricultural sustainable development, such as water and energy shortages, as well as grain safeguard. In this study, a “TKL-WEFN” model combining Tapio decoupling, Kaya, and LMDI was used to evaluate the synergistic relationship from the water-energy-food (WEF) and determine the key drivers taking Wuqiao County in the NCP as a case. The results showed as follows: the synergistic relationship between water-food, as well as energy-food, showed a “M” shaped fluctuation trend from 2009 to 2018 in Wuqiao County. The best performance was achieved in 2011 and 2016, with the state of high yield and low resource consumption. Food increased by 9.43% and 3.52%, while water resources decreased by 5.95% and 8.91%, and energy decreased by 5.36% and 2.15% in 2011 and 2016, respectively.

Here, we proposed a novel framework for assessing regional water balance health considering three dimensions of water problems about imbalances: water scarcity, water inequality, and systems incoordination. This paper first quantified the levels of water balance health at multiple geographic and temporal scales in China, and then investigated the critical components and the impacts of improved surface water quality, inter-basin water transfer, and unconventional water use on the local water balance health. Results showed that China was under an unhealthy water balance due to multiple imbalances based on the annual average assessments during 2014–2018. More than 45% of the national population (∼615 million people) was affected by an unhealthy water balance. Hotspots with unhealthy water balance exhibited spatial heterogeneity and temporal variability, with Northern China experiencing unhealthy water balance throughout the year, while Southern China usually faced this issue during the winter. Unhealthy water balance in Northern China was primarily driven by water scarcity, while in the west of the Hu-Huanyong Line, water inequality exacerbated the situation. Southeastern China faced systems incoordination, particularly vulnerable during extreme events, such as severe droughts. More than 400 and 150 million people benefited significantly from improved surface water quality and inter-basin water transfer, respectively, relieving unhealthy water balance. However, the effectiveness of unconventional water use was found to be limited.

This study conducts a conceptual framework to evaluate the impact of water utilization changes on the water-land-energy-carbon (WLEC) nexus in the Yellow River Basin (YRB), and quantitatively discusses the complex interactions between water utilization changes and the total WLEC system and subsystems by applying the coupling coordination degree. Results present that: (1) the overall difference in the water utilization quantity of the YRB is expanding, and the water utilization types and efficiency show significant heterogeneity of flow segments.

Understanding the mechanical properties of the concrete made with recycled coarse aggregate (RCA) and recycled glass sand (RGS) under complex stress states can enhance its practical application. This study first investigated the microscopic properties of interfacial transition zones (ITZs) using nanoscratch and backscattered electron-based (BSE-based) image analysis. Subsequently, mechanical properties under confining pressures ranging from 0 to 14 MPa and pore water pressure ranging from 0 to 13 MPa were assessed based on the stress-strain behaviours. The results reveal that the chemical activity and specific surface areas of aggregate were closely related to ITZ microscopic properties. Despite with the same water-cement ratio, the ITZs between RCA and the paste matrix displayed better cohesion performance than the ITZs between RGS and the paste matrix. Confining pressure was found to increase the internal friction angle of concrete, thereby improving mechanical strength and ductility. The poor cohesion of the RGS-paste matrix interface resulted in a decrease in the peak stress and an increase in the peak strain under triaxial compression. Pore water pressure played a dual role in triaxial compression, providing support and promoting crack expansion. The supporting effect enhanced the initial stiffness of concrete, while the crack expansion effect reduced the peak stress. The William-Warnke failure criterion was proven to be suitable for describing the failure surfaces of concrete with RCA and RGS under various complex stress states. To accurately predict the stress-strain curve, it is essential to comprehensively consider the influence of ITZs in concrete and the effect of pore water pressure.";"2024-02-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624004530";"13";"Water Other"

Sewer pipes with low health and severe failure consequences should be the primary focus of daily maintenance and management for drainage authorities. Conversely, sewer pipes with high health and low failure consequences are temporarily not a primary concern, in order to reduce resource wastage within the constraints of limited economic and time resources. Thus, the scientific analysis of their relationships is deemed essential. This paper applies supply-demand balance theory to analyze the relationship. On the supply side, a health Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation model (HFCE) is proposed with weighted hierarchies established. On the demand side, a failure consequences FCE model (FFCE) is established. Each sewer pipe's supply-demand balance score is analyzed using matrix multiplication, highlighting two types of imbalanced pipes and sub-districts.

Thermal groundwater in Xihai geothermal field has lower pH (5.97–7.38) than the local nonthermal water (6.47–8.13). It originates from the meteoric water of northeastern mountainous area with the elevation of 3988–5110 m, and percolates downwards along the NE-trending primary fault F5 with the circulation depth of 3270–4855 m. The deep cycling groundwater is heated by the terrestrial heat flow with reservoir temperature of 134.95–201.09°C. Thermal groundwater has the residence time up to more than 20 ka beneath, leading to sufficient water-rock interactions and higher TDS (818.00–886.60 mg/L) and much saltier hydrochemical facies (HCO3–Mg·Ca) than the local nonthermal water. Faults and fissures developed in the discharge area of geothermal field provide favorable conditions for nonthermal water infiltrating downwards and mixing with the upwelling thermal groundwater. The ratio of nonthermal water mixed-in reaches to 59.5–85.6% for thermal groundwater in the discharge area of Xihai geothermal field and presents a gradual increase along the upward flow path of thermal groundwater or with the increase of distance to the primary faults. These large ratio of nonthermal water mixed-in would cool the thermal groundwater and change its output physicochemical and isotopic features, and lead to underestimation of geothermal potential and hydro-geothermal behaviors based on the apparent data of sampled thermal groundwaters from the discharge area.

Addressing this evolution, this manuscript has applied an innovative methodology to calculate a WEF nexus index (WEFni). This index seamlessly integrates both environmental and nutritional profiles across diverse case studies involving fisheries, aquaculture, and processing production systems in the European Atlantic area. The results showed that when it comes to fishing, purse seine fishing obtained the highest score (99%). For the aquaculture activities, seafood (>73%) obtained better results than fish farming.

Thus, integrated-weight water quality index (IWQI) and source-specific health risk assessment model built on the combination of Hazard Index (HI) and Total Cancer Risk (TCR) standard models and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model were utilized to investigate the controls simultaneously from hydrogeological processes and anthropogenic activities on groundwater quality and quantitative health risks in a representative resource-based city/area (i.e., Handan area). The results indicated that localized-disequilibrium of hydrochemical characteristics was mainly controlled by weathering processes of outcropped rocks and aquifers with different lithology. Most of groundwater (94.47 %) can be classified as excellent and good levels, while groundwater quality deterioration occurred in eastern plain. Traditional hydrochemical analysis approaches together with saturation index (SI) and Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that water-rock interaction, semi-arid climate, positive cation exchange and agricultural activities can intensify groundwater quality deterioration. There was a moderate non-carcinogenic risk and a high carcinogenic risk induced by PTMs in groundwater. Non-carcinogenic risk was mainly caused by heavy industry (34.93 %) and agricultural activities (32.94 %), while carcinogenic risk was dominated by agricultural activities (37.92 %) and heavy industry (35.58 %). Coal mining accounted for 18.16 % of non-carcinogenic risk and 20.98 % of carcinogenic risk respectively. Traffic contamination and geogenic source merely made a minor contribution. These results suggested that source-specific health risk assessment model can clearly quantify the allocations of different sources to the health risks, which was worth being popularized in the field of groundwater researches. This study contributed to profound understanding on groundwater quality deterioration and contamination collectively induced by various hydrogeological and anthropogenic factors, and provided a reference for developing contamination source-oriented countermeasures of groundwater pollution to other resource-based cities/areas worldwide.

However, the recovery of energy from IS can be improved through the coordinative processing with biomass. In this study, we explored the comprehensive pyrolysis characteristics of IS, rice straw (RS), and the synergistic effects of blending and pelletization. Additionally, this study investigated the pyrolysis kinetic behavior of IS-RS pellets for the first time. Our findings suggest that both blending and pelletization treatments improved heat and mass transfer characteristics. Pelletization treatment also promotes low-temperature pyrolysis, torrefaction (<553 K), over direct blending. Blending and pelletization contribute to the release of gaseous products at a lower temperature, which improved the inner passage of pellets, leading to CO2 reduction. Pelletization also hindered the emission of N and S-related gases, while blending facilitated the release of NO at a high heating rate. Moreover, our study found that direct blending treatment had no significant effect on pyrolysis activation energy (E a) based on Friedman model-free estimation. The first stage of pellet feedstock had an E a value of 115.05 kJ/mol, while the second stage had an E a value of 226.50 kJ/mol. Lastly, we applied the compensation effect method to investigate pre-exponential factor ln A(α), and mechanism values (f(α)) were also estimated, along with the list of compensating parameter functions. Our finding could be helpful in the design of sludge thermal treatment. ";"2024-02-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624003342";"14";"Water Other"

The contradiction between water abandonment and water shortage often arises in the clearing results of EE method. In order to address the contradiction, this study proposes a new spot market clearing framework suitable for series-parallel hybrid cascade hydropower stations where the coupling relations of hydraulic power, electric power and electricity price (HEE) are all taken into consideration. This framework presents a new index called hydraulic power-electric power (HE) coupling degree for assessing water abandonment and water shortage in cascade hydropower. Additionally, it suggests adjusting strategies to achieve optimal matching of hydraulic power and electric power. Lastly, a third-stage HEE deep coupling clearing model is proposed. The simulation results demonstrate several advantages of the proposed clearing framework over the traditional EE method. It not only ensures the economy of power purchase but also reduces water abandonment rate by 1.07 % and enhances the HE coupling degree by 3.41 %. Moreover, it effectively eliminates power shortage occurrences, achieves electric equilibrium of supply and demand in the power grid, and maximizes the utilization of abandoned water resources.

This methodology used OM concentration as the exclusive variable for input, facilitating the prediction of electricity generation with variable Coulombic efficiency. The employed MFC, of tubular design, incorporates an air core surrounded by a carbon-based cathode, an anion exchange membrane, nonwoven graphite fabric, and encircled by twelve carbon brush anodes. This setup successfully reduced chemical oxygen demand (COD) from 180 to 50 mg L−1 and biological oxygen demand (BOD) from 84 to 15 mg L−1 within a 35 h hydraulic retention time (HRT). The resulting effluent BOD satisfies Japanese wastewater treatment standards. In the early HRT phase, the MFC exhibited rapid OM reduction, followed by a stabilization of OM concentration. Despite varying HRTs and the sustained OM levels at prolonged HRTs, the MFC consistently generated 0.29 ± 0.14 A m−2. This apparent contradiction prompted the consideration of additional OM sources from the anode biomass (C b ). Calculating electricity production based on OM concentration rather than OM degradation was achieved by assessing anode resistance (R A n ) across different levels of OM supplementation, employing the Butler–Volmer equation. This approach, incorporating considerations for C b and R A n , accurately reproduced MFC performance. It was observed that OM supplementation from C b constituted 50% at 11 h HRT and escalated to 90% at 27 h HRT. Further analysis, including 16S rRNA gene-based microbial community profiling, indicated that higher cathode resistance (RCat ) at 1.0 Ω m2, compared to a minimum R A n of 0.10 Ω m2, favored methanogenesis over electrogenesis on the carbon brushes. This finding underscores the importance of reducing R Cat and minimizing electrode distance, coupled with enhancing the specific surface area of both electrodes, as crucial factors for the advancement of MFC technology.

How to manage the interrelationships among the population, water, ecology, and economy (PWEE) in UAs is crucial for the future of China's urbanization development. Based on the system dynamics (SD) approach, we constructed an SD model for simulating the interrelationships among PWEE in UAs, elucidating the intricate nonlinear relationships between elements of the PWEE system through causal feedback processes and model equations. In addition, we take the Tianshan North slope urban agglomeration (TSNSUA) as an example, which is a representative area where water resources crisis and ecological risk coexist, and designed five scenarios to dynamically simulate the balance of water supply and demand under the high-density population and economic agglomeration, as well as the potential ecological environmental effects in the process of urban spatial expansion. Our findings include: (1) The existing water resources conditions of TSNSUA can continue to support the current population and economic growth rates. If the future development plan follows the status quo continuation scenario, the phenomenon of insufficient water supply will not occur on the premise that the water supply capacity remains at its current highest level. (2) TSNSUA's future urban spatial expansion is predicted to have less overall impact on the ecological environment, and the carbon peak target by 2030 has an opportunity to be achieved. (3) Appropriately reducing the proportion of agricultural water, while strengthening water-saving and ecological protection measures, can ensure that TSNSUA's population and economy maintain a medium to high growth rate.

However, synergistic effects between disinfectants and antibiotics often occur in pipeline due to the presence of residual disinfectants. How this interaction affects the drinking water microbial community remains unknown. Herein, reactors with 2 h of hydraulic retention time (HRT) were constructed to simulate the drinking water distribution system (DWDS), and the antibiotics were continuously discharged to the reactor. Sulfamethoxazole (SMX) was used as a representative antibiotic, and treatment protocols with and without disinfectants were compared. High-throughput sequencing and metagenome were used to study the microbial community and function in polyethylene (PE) and ductile cast iron (DI) (protected by cement mortar lining) pipes. By measuring the enzyme activity and ATP content, we found that disinfectant exposure could not only increase the secretion of biofilm EPS, but also improve the bacterial activity to a certain extent. The synergistic effect of antibiotics and disinfectants could increase the activity of oxidative stress-related enzymes in microbial communities, and the main effect was antibiotic stress. This study not only provides insights into how to inhibit the transmission process of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in biofilm in DWDS, but also provides enlightenment for the harm of ARGs in all carriers where biofilms may exist in water plants.

Therefore, this paper established a dynamic differential game model of pollution management in the trans-jurisdictional river basins composed of upstream and downstream governments and sewage enterprises, calculated the strategic equilibrium solution of multi-stakeholders, analyzed the changes of strategy selection of different stakeholders under cost and non-cost sharing, and simulated strategy selection of stakeholders under multi-scenarios. The main findings are as follows: (1) Cost sharing policy enhances the governance efforts level of all stakeholders and increases social welfare. (2) The selection of governance strategies by multiple stakeholders has an interactive influence which is affected by the cost–benefit relationship of each stakeholder. The proportion of cost sharing and incentives affect the variation of the utility of the upstream government, downstream government, and sewage enterprises in cooperation. (3) The increase in the attenuation coefficient of governance utilities and the governance costs of the three parties will reduce the level of water pollution management efforts of the three parties. (4) The increase of marginal utility and social welfare effect will enhance the level of governance efforts. (5) The cost sharing ratio of the downstream government has an impact on the governance efforts of the upstream government.

However, water shortages seriously restrict the high-quality development of the local economy and society. This study assessed the temporal and spatial patterns of the agricultural blue (WFblue) and green (WFgreen) water footprints of six crops in the lower reaches of the YRB based on Penman-Monteith method, established composite agriculture water (AWS), agricultural blue water (AWSblue), and agricultural green water (AWSgreen) footprint scarcity indexes to evaluate the agricultural security level of blue and green water resources in the lower reaches of the YRB. And the Spatial pattern of blue and green water footprint scarcity indexes for 2030 was predicted. The results showed that in 2020, the total WFgreen of six crops in the lower reaches of the YRB was 58.45 billion m³, of which the WFgreen of maize accounted for 47.53%, followed by winter wheat (32.01%). The total agricultural blue water footprint (WFblue) of six crops was 46.12 billion m³, and the winter wheat had the highest WFblue (32.00 billion m³) and accounted for 69.39%, followed by maize (8.19 billion m³, 17.76%). The total blue water evapotranspiration (ETblue) of crops in the northwestern lower reaches of the YRB was generally higher than that in the southeastern region. However, the ETgreen spatial layout showed the opposite trend. From 2010 to 2020, the WS decreased overall, and the proportion of regions with a WS greater than 1 decreased from 73.5% in 2010 to 61.76% in 2020. By 2030, AWS in the lower reaches of the YRB will further intensify. Compared to 2020, in 76.47% of cities the AWS showed an increasing trend, 58.82% of cities will be in extreme insecurity, and the proportion of areas with the AWSblue in an insecure state will be 35.29%, green water resources are relatively abundant and will be in a safe and relatively safe state in 2030. Although the AWSgreen of 91.18% of cities in 2030 showed an increasing trend compared to that in 2020. AWSgreen showed that the lower reaches of the YRB are still in a safe and relatively safe state.

This study aimed to detail the mechanisms of benthic oxygen and acid processes by determining high-resolution and high-quality chemical gradients and acquiring heterogeneous data for diurnal changes in dissolved oxygen (DO)/pH at the water–sediment interface (SWI) during different stages of algal degradation. Planar optode (PO) systems were used to obtain dynamic two-dimensional (2D) images of DO/pH at a laboratory microcosm interface. The benthic gradient and diurnal variation of DO/pH at the SWI were jointly regulated by the photosynthesis/respiration and migration behaviors of algae, through their influence on the water–carbon chemistry. The DO/pH at the SWI showed unique diurnal variation characteristics at different stages of algal degradation; however, characteristics consistent with the diurnal variation in photosynthesis were limited to the algal growth period. The increase in DO/pH during the daytime resulted from O2-rich and carbonate hydrolysis, to compensate for the reduction in CO2 saturation caused by algal photosynthesis. Nocturnal DO/pH decreased owing to O2 depletion and H+ release, because of increased water CO2 content from algal respiration. When photosynthesis and respiration were inhibited, or not smooth, DO/pH showed a limited increase with uncertainty. The sediment was not completely anaerobic, and DO/pH penetrated to −20 mm and even to the bottom of the interface (−40 mm) as a result of algal migration, whereas DO was exhausted and high pH areas transferred to sediments following algal decay. Sediments acted as storage pools in alkaline environments, which posed a potential risk for water eutrophication. The trajectory of algal activity at the SWI was highly consistent with the dynamic variation in DO/pH. Our findings provide new insights for in situ tracking and early prediction of algal blooms, and can be used to formulate a theoretical basis for the mechanism of eutrophication processes and for exploring new algal control technologies.

Furthermore, the study found the positive impact of social interaction on SWC adoption is more pronounced for farmers in larger villages and those who join cooperative societies. Therefore, the research results provide a new perspective for promoting SWC in China, emphasizing the importance of enhancing social interaction improving farmers' ability to acquire information, and accelerating internet use.

A multifunctionalized superhydrophobic coating was generated via cross-linking 3-(Trimethoxysilyl) propyl acrylate with Polyethyleneimine in a multifunctional covalent manner and modifying the cotton fabric surface with silylated modified rosin acid (RA-Si) as well as TiO2 nanoparticles. The coated samples had remarkable superhydrophobicity with self-cleaning as well as stain resistance. With bactericidal rates of 97.73 % and 98.36 %, respectively, the coated samples effectively inhibited the formation of biofilms and showed high antimicrobial performance for both Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. Meanwhile, the coated samples showed outstanding oil absorption and separation of the oil-water mixture. Both water-in-oil and oil-in-water stable emulsions would be effectively separated out of the coated samples after demulsifying. Additionally, the water droplet contact angle of the coated samples was maintained at approximately 150.0° after mechanical and chemical testing. It was noteworthy that the coated samples still exhibited satisfactory separation for stabilizing oil/water emulsions after mechanical wear and chemical corrosion treatment, indicating their excellent mechanical durability. The prepared multifunctional RA-TiO2 superhydrophobic coating has promising applications in oil-containing wastewater treatment and environmental remediation.

Specifically, the paper provides generally applicable and new contributions in formulating WEF nexus problems as multi-objective, multi-period optimization problems with data-driven models based on field work. The paper also established a systematic method for integrating and reconciling farming methods, water technologies, energy-resource selection and operation, carbon footprint, and economic factors. A superstructure representation is used to embed the candidate options and configurations. An optimization formulation is developed to determine the optimal system configuration, water and energy uses and sources, and crop mix selection. A multi-period model is developed to account for the seasonal variability. The optimization model is solved under different carbon-footprint cuts to establish a tradeoff curve between the economic and environmental objectives. To generate the necessary experimental data for a meaningful case study, a year-long field study was carried out to generate experimental data for three fields were constructed in Kuwait using open-field, agrivoltaic, and greenhouse farming methods. The field data were extracted and coupled with the optimization formulation to apply the proposed approach to a case study. First, the optimization formulation was solved to maximize the net profit with no limits on the carbon footprint. The solution of this relaxed formulation gives a maximum profit of 2.127 MM USD/y and an annual emission of 2242 tonne CO2eq. Next, the optimization formulation was solved with the objective of minimizing the total annual emissions. The result was a minimum annual emission of 363 tonne CO2eq that corresponded to 1.366 MM USD/y of profit. The ɛ-constraint method was employed to establish tradeoffs between the economic and environmental objectives. The solutions also provided valuable information on the percentage contribution of solar energy and water sources.

While it is common practice to involve stakeholders in participatory modelling processes, their comprehensive documentation and the lessons learned remain scarce. In this paper, we share our experience of engaging stakeholders throughout the entire system dynamics modelling process. We draw on two projects implemented in the Volta River Basin, West Africa, to understand the dynamics of water and agri-food systems under changing environmental and socioeconomic conditions. We outline eight key insights and lessons as practical guides derived from each stage of the participatory modelling process, including the pre-workshop stage, problem definition, model conceptualization, simulation model formulation, model testing and verification, and policy design and evaluation. Our findings demonstrate that stakeholders can actively contribute to all phases of the system dynamics modelling process, including parameter estimation, sensitivity analysis, and numerical simulation experiments. However, we encountered notable challenges, including the time-intensive nature of the process, the struggle to reach a consensus on the modelled problem, and the difficulty of translating the conceptual model into a simulation model using stock and flow diagrams – all of which were addressed through a structured facilitation process. While the projects were anchored in the specific context of West Africa, the key lessons and insights highlighted have broader significance, particularly for researchers employing PSDM in regions characterised by multifaceted human-environmental systems and where stakeholder involvement is crucial for holistic understanding and effective policy interventions. This paper contributes practical guidance for future efforts with participatory modelling, particularly in regions worldwide grappling with sustainable development challenges in water and agri-food systems, and where stakeholder involvement is crucial for holistic understanding of the multiple challenges and for designing effective policy interventions.

The trade-off among these resources can limit regional economic development and pose challenges to livelihood security. In this study, we constructed a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) index to measure the water-energy-food nexus (WEFN) trade-off. Multi-source data and analysis methods, including ordinary least square (OLS), geographically weighted regression (GWR), and geographic detectors (GD) are employed to explore the trade-offs of water, energy, and food resources and their dominant influencing factors in the Mu Us Sandy Land. The results indicate that the trade-off between regional water-food sub-nexus exhibited the highest magnitude, and trade-offs among all sub-nexus types demonstrated significant fluctuations in spatial distribution. Both OLS and GWR results identified temperature, precipitation, normalized differential vegetation index, slope, digital elevation model, and nighttime light as significant factors influencing the spatial differentiation of WEFN trade-offs. Moreover, geographic detector analysis indicated that precipitation is the dominant factor, and its interaction with other influencing factors further impacts the regional WEFN trade-off. The discussion section examines the RMSD method's effectiveness, the dominant factors shaping WEFN trade-offs, as well as scale effect in WEFN trade-offs in the Mu Us area and underscores that mitigation of water shortages can yield a leverage effect, leading to a marked reduction in the trade-offs. This research contributes new ideas and tools to WEFN research from a geographic perspective, aiming to provide guidance for collaborative resource management and regional sustainable development.

Since CMA contains asphalt emulsion, the interaction between emulsion and cement-based grouting material is expected to affect the mechanical properties of the final SFP composite. Therefore, this study investigates the effects of water remaining in the PA mixture at the time of grouting on the mechanical properties of CMA based SFP composite (C-SFPM), using HMA based SFP composite (H-SFPM) as a reference. To prepare C-SFPM, emulsified PA specimens were grouted after different amounts of water (10%, 30%, 60% and 90% by weight, respectively) evaporated from the compacted specimen. The strength, stiffness, moisture damage resistance, ravelling resistance, interfacial bond strength, and microstructural change in C-SFPM and H-SFPM were evaluated at different curing periods. Different mechanical parameters were found to be significantly affected by the time of grouting. Specifically, the detrimental effect of water present in the emulsified PA was identified from ravelling based laboratory evaluation (Cantabro loss value as high as 97.9% was observed). The microstructural analysis also indicated that the formation of hydration product in C-SFPM would be significantly influenced by the amount of water present in the emulsified PA mixture at the time of grouting. Overall, this study indicates that water present in the emulsified mixture has a negative effect on the mechanical properties of C-SFPM.

However, urban wetlands, particularly geographically isolated wetlands (GIWs), face threats from climate change and rapid urbanization. The vulnerability of GIWs, considering the critical water flux exchanges with their surroundings, remains unclear. This study proposes a groundbreaking two-stage assessment framework for evaluating GIW sustainability. The first stage quantifies dryness risk by assessing the absence of surface water storage. The second stage evaluates wetland loss risk by examining unsustainable conditions of lacking saturated soil. The framework utilizes a hydrological model incorporated with 20 Global Climate Models (GCMs) under multiple greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Moreover, Taguchi optimization is firstly introduced the hydro-climate field to improve simulation efficiency, with a new modification by a modified robust design. Results indicate an average 26 cm drop in the GIW water table by 2099 under moderate GCM scenarios, with an 86% risk of drying and a 64% risk of transitioning to loss. Notably, GIWs face over twice the risk of loss compared to upland areas, but demonstrate an advantage in water reservation under climate change. By proposing and employing this innovative approach, this research provides valuable insights into the interconnectedness of GIWs, offering a more comprehensive understanding of long-term urban ecological integrity. The findings also contribute to the long-term sustainability of urban wetlands and enhance the resilience of urban ecosystems.

It is crucial to develop methods to reduce energy consumption by increasing the percent solids in the paper web entering the dryers from the presses. This research aimed to develop a fundamental understanding of the effect of bio-chemo-mechanical pretreatments on a bleached softwood fiber matrix and evaluate the impact on the percent solids of the paper web after pressing. Experiments included enzymatic, refining, and cationic polymer pretreatments on the bleached softwood pulps, followed by laboratory papermaking and determining the equilibrium moisture content (EMC) after pressing and the pulp and paper properties. The combined effect of mild refining, controlled enzymatic pretreatments, and cationic strength aids proved to enhance the water removal during wet pressing (up to 35 % reduction) and increase paper strength (up to 60 % increase). The results of increased solids after pressing were used to calculate the potential reduction in drying energy during paper manufacturing. Energy savings of around 10 % for paper drying could be achieved through fiber matrix modification by bio-chemo-mechanical pretreatment. Enzymatic pretreatments have previously been conventionally applied before refining as an energy-saving method. However, this research shows that synergistic actions of enzymes added after refining modify the fibers and create the optimal conditions for enhancement in drainage, press dewatering, and paper properties.

However, the mismatch between water resource distribution and spatial layout of population and productivity poses great challenge to water supply security of the GHMGBA. Evaluating the spatial suitability of water supply pressure (WSP) and waterworks water supply capacity (WSC) is essential to the spatial equilibrium allocation of water resources and water supply security in the GHMGBA. Therefore, the current study first investigated the spatial-temporal evolution pattern of WSP and waterworks WSC using the standard deviational ellipse and Exploratory Spatial Data Analysis (ESDA) methods, the spatial suitability of WSP and waterworks WSC was further evaluated using the coupling coordination degree model, and the driving mechanism of such spatial suitability was finally revealed using the dynamic spatial Durbin model. The results show that the WSP respectively forms high and low value aggregations in the eastern and western parts of the Pearl River estuary; the area with high waterworks WSC is mainly located in the northern part, the high-high cluster areas are in the eastern part of Zhaoqing and the western part of Huizhou, and the low-low cluster areas are mainly in Guangzhou-Foshan, Shenzhen-Hong Kong and Zhuhai-Macao. The coupling coordination of WSP and waterworks WSC was in an overall imbalance state. The eastern and western parts of the Pearl River estuary are slightly unbalanced or with better level.

The influence of biochar content, initial water content (w 0), and biochar saturation on the compression behavior of biochar-treated soils with high water content is analyzed. The results revealed that the addition of both raw biochar and biochar saturated with water significantly enhances the remolded yield stress (σ′yr) and reduced the void ratio (e yr) at σ′yr. Raw biochar exhibits higher σ′yr and lower e yr values compared to water-saturated biochar, mainly due to its greater water absorbing potential of raw biochar. The variations of σ′yr and e yr induced by biochar can be attributed to the decrease in initial void ratio (e 0) and the increase in void ratio at liquid limit (e L), which can be effectively normalized using empirical equation developed for reconstituted soil without biochar. Furthermore, the compression parameters (e* 100 and C* c) show a decreasing trend with increasing biochar content and decreasing initial water content.

In this study, a Copula-based radial interval chance-constrained programming (CRICP) was developed. CRICP can not only quantify composite risk induced by multiple risks with nonlinear correlations, but also tackle dual uncertainty expressed as redial intervals with adjustable protection levels. CRICP was applied to an irrigated agricultural management problem constrained by water, energy, and land resource in Bayan Nur City in northern China. Results indicate that system benefit would increase with the incline of composite risk or the decline of protection level. Monte Carlo simulation verified that the different definitions of composite risk could lead to significant differences in the combination of subsystem risks. The composite risk induced by the simultaneous shortage of multiple resources would have greater impacts on system benefits compared against composite risk caused by shortage of at least one resources, with an increase of [24.65%, 25.95%] in the minimum value of system benefits. Comparisons against two alternative models further verified that CRICP outweighs previous methods by modeling the correlation structure of multiple risks and tackling dual uncertainties without distribution information.

Due to the existence of different types of LID systems, it is difficult to choose the best combination of them. The purpose of this research is to rank different LID systems and choose the best combination or arrangement of them under climate change using TODIM multi-criteria decision making method, which has not been done so far, in the northernmost of Tehran city (Iran), which also includes part of Tehran municipality districts 1 and 3 and it is adjacent to Tehran municipality district 6. Previously by the authors, surface runoff in the near future (2030–2047) and far future (2048–2065) under three scenarios of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP2.6), (RCP4.5), and (RCP8.5) with the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was simulated (Dougaheh et al., 2023). Next the LID systems, including Vegetative Swale, bio-retention cell, infiltration trench and permeable pavement, are optimized with Multi-Objective Harris Hawks Optimization (MOHHO) algorithm. Then, using the Pareto Fronts obtained from the optimization algorithm, seven combinations of different LID systems were extracted as final alternatives. Then, the objective functions of the optimization algorithm, including the minimization of the volume of outflow runoff of the basin and the minimization of the cost of construction and maintenance of LID, are determined as problem criteria and weighted by the Entropy-Shannon method. The results show that the volume of urban runoff with the use of LID systems, in all future time periods under RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5 scenarios, will decrease by an average of 54% compared to the baseline time period, and the maximum percentage of volume reduction of the flood is related to the baseline period. In the future research, taking into account the qualitative parameters, the performance of the urban runoff collection system can be evaluated qualitatively in addition to quantitatively.

Herein, a dual-cathode bioelectrochemical system (BES) was developed, where one cathode produced electricity energy (Power-cathode) and the other cathode produced hydrogen (H2-cathode). When the applied voltage of the H2-cathode was 0.6 V, the maximum voltage generated by the Power-cathode was 0.47 ± 0.03 V, and the hydrogen rate of the H2-cathode was 0.19 ± 0.003 m3/m3/d. The applied voltage of the H2-cathode was ≤0.4 V, which could be supplied entirely with the power generated by the Power-cathode. Geobacter could accumulate in the anodic biofilm through electric potential differences stimulation. The proportion of electroactive bacteria at the bottom of the anode biofilm was higher than that at the top, while denitrifying bacteria were the opposite. A peak-like distribution of electroactive bacteria in the anodic biofilm and denitrifying bacteria formed a valley-like distribution. Those results have demonstrated a new approach based on dual-cathode BES to produce hydrogen and electricity synchronously, and further proposed a bacterial distribution pattern in anode biofilms. This is of great significance for improving the performance of BES in sustainable wastewater treatment and resource recovery.

Therefore, the creation of quick and efficient sulfoxide detection techniques is crucial to comprehending the ecotoxicity of sulfoxides. However, sulfur oxides were mainly detected in a pure water system, which greatly limited their potential practical applications. Difficulties related to selecting a detection system are a common bottleneck for applications. Herein, a brand-new fluorescent probe called BZ-QL was designed. This probe emits different fluorescence intensities in the sediment and water samples from a natural lake (China's Dianchi Lake). For the first time, the detection of sulfoxide in natural lake was realized on the basis of the correlation of the gene abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) with fluorescence intensities. Results indicated a significant negative correlation between the fluorescence intensities of BZ-QL and the abundance of dsrA for the water samples (R 2 = 0.35, P < 0.01) and sediments (R 2 = 0.16, P < 0.05). The combination of fluorescence intensities and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) of SRB could provide unique techniques for detecting sulfur oxides in water samples. Compared with other sulfur dioxide fluorescent probes, the fluorescence detection method in this study introduces the parameter of gene abundance, and applies the probe technology to detect sulfur oxides in natural lakes. In the future, this simple and rapid detection technology could be converted into kits for promotion. In addition, other compounds could be detected by changing the recognition site of the probe.

The ENR concentration was set at 0, 0.1, 1 and 10 mg/L for four phases in sequence. As the influent ENR concentration increased, the nitrate removal efficiency (NrE) in the pyrite-based autotrophic denitrification (PAD) system declined gradually to 11.08% (minimum) and the expressed narG/H/I and napA/B genes decreased. However, the NrE in the polycaprolactone-based heterotrophic denitrification (PHD) and mixotrophic denitrification systems declined slightly (the lowest NrE: 88.10% and 85.28%, respectively), and the expressed narG/H/I (0–1 mg/L) and napA/B genes increased gradually in the PHD system.

The Fenton process has ideal dewaterability at different initial pH levels. However, the difference in the initial pH levels can lead to variations in conditioner dosage, resulting in different environmental impacts and economic pressures. This study provides insights into the role of the life cycle linked response surface methodology (LC-RSM) framework in revealing optimal solutions with both environmental and economic performance in different combinations of conditioners. Response surface methodology (RSM) was used to construct a model of sludge dewatering by the Fenton process, and life cycle assessment and life cycle cost were used to quantify the environmental and economic performance of all conditioning solutions in the model. The LC-RSM optimization solution was 6%–68% and 15%–70% lower than the RSM recommended solution in terms of environmental impacts and economic costs, respectively. For specific impact categories, such as global warming potential, the LC-RSM optimization solution was 19%–56% lower than the RSM recommended solution. In addition, the total environmental impact of the different conditioner combinations ranged between 4.1 and 7.8 Pt and 3.2–6.7 Pt at 53% and 58% of the sludge target water content, respectively. Surprisingly, the environmental impact of the solution with superior dewatering performance (53%) was lower than that of the solution with poor dewatering performance (58%) in many cases. The above results show that the LC-RSM optimization solution has better environmental and economic performance compared to RSM. In addition, the environmental impacts and economic costs of different solutions with the same water content target vary widely, which may lead to comparing sludge conditioning procedures with different targets in an unfair environment. Therefore, a unified platform for comparison is needed, and LC-RSM can provide support. This study can assist decision-makers in identifying the best solution for both environmental and economic performance in a multivariate system and stimulate further discussion on how to compare different processes on a more uniform platform.

Thus, in this paper, attempts are made to incorporate the resilience of water resource systems into the constraint set and explore the optimal layout of agricultural planting structures in irrigation areas. We selected 12 sample irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province, China, including Chahayang, Fuyu, and Tailai, as the research areas and considered their actual situations. Then, we established a multiobjective optimization model for an agricultural planting structure with rice, soybean, and corn planting areas as decision variables; socioeconomic benefits, agricultural production benefits, ecological benefits, and water resource benefits as objective functions; and water resource system resilience and net crop output value and other factors as constraints. Fifteen scenarios were assessed through the combination of objective functions, and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm III (NSGA-III) was used to optimize and analyze the agricultural planting structure of typical irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province and to determine the optimal planting plan. The research results found that the function values adjusted by planting area have significantly improved compared to those before optimization. The adjustment trend of agricultural planting area is to increase the planting area of rice and soybean and reduce the planting area of corn. The introduction of constraints on water resource system resilience ensures that other benefits remain basically unchanged; thus, the water resource objective function is significantly better with resilience constraints than without them. Therefore, water resource system resilience can act as an effective constraint; this finding enriches and expands the theoretical and methodological system for optimizing the management of agricultural planting structures in irrigation areas and thus provides important technological support for ensuring regional food security, ecological security, and water security, which has substantial practical significance.

In this study, poly dimethyl diallyl ammonium chloride (PDMDAAC) as coagulant, and polyacrylamide (PAM) as flocculant, were used for synergistic enhancement of the coal slurry water sedimentation and dehydration process. The best pharmaceutical system was determined by integrating the evaluation indexes in the sedimentation and dehydration process. The mechanism of synergistic enhancement of coal slurry water sedimentation and dehydration process using PDMDAAC/PAM was revealed by analyzing zeta potential, SEM, XPS and FTIR spectroscopy results. Moreover, the Box–Behnken response surface methodology was used to determine the order of significance of coagulant dosage (Cc), flocculant dosage (Cm), and coal slurry water concentration (Cs) on the combined sedimentation and dehydration indexes, and Cm > Cs > Cc. Further, the correlation models between the combined sedimentation and dehydration indexes and each factor were established, the pharmaceutical system was further optimized, and model accuracy was verified. The optimal dosage of PDMDAAC10040 was 2.96 mg/L, and that of PAM2610 was 2.31 mg/L. Then, the industrial trials were conducted at the Tara Trench coal processing plant.

Herein, we construct a Janus micro-composite with dual functions of detection and degradation for the efficient detection and removal of catechol. The Janus micro-composite for laccase immobilization was prepared by growing manganese dioxide nanoparticles (MnO2 NPs) on the hemisphere of copper sulfide (CuS) loaded with carbon (C) dots (Lac-MnO2@C@CuS).

Drought in agriculture significantly threatens food security and social stability. Understanding drought variability in the cultivated land can lay the foundation for crop management. Considering the effects of drought on the actual crop growth process and precise irrigation under limited water resources is a great challenge. In this study, standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) and soil water content were used to study the spatiotemporal characteristics of drought during maize growth in Heilongjiang Province. The distributed AquaCrop model and grey theory were used to study the relationship between irrigation, drought and maize yield at the grid scale, and the current irrigation effect was evaluated by simulating the comparison of crop yield under non-irrigation and irrigated conditions, so as to provide a basis for optimizing the irrigation system in the future. In addition, Future drought trends were also examined using the Mann-Kendall statistical test, Sen's slope, and Hurst index. The results are as follows: (1) Based on remote sensing inversion and distributed AquaCrop model, the relationship between drought and crop yield can be studied at grid scale, which can refine the impact of drought on crop yield in different cells. (2) Irrigation can increase crop yields by at least 20–40% in about 60% of areas in the Heilongjiang Province. (3) In response to the drought characteristics of alternating wet and dry variations or consistent wet and dry variations in different months, inter-regional water transfer can be used to cope with or ensure increased irrigation in drought-prone months (May and June) to achieve water conservation and efficiency.

A water-use constrained multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model is developed to analyze the impacts on economic outputs resulting from different water constraints imposed on economic sectors. A series of scenarios are designed to represent different levels of sectoral water use restrictions based on short-term water policy and water stress alleviation targets. Results reveal that regions experience different levels of water stress displaying diverse economic impacts due to future water restrictions. Overall, national economic outputs will experience a 0.76–1.14% decrease compared to the baseline scenario, that is, the “business-as-usual” scenario.

In this study, the influence of the EDT on the corrosion characteristics of carbon steel was comprehensively investigated in field CCWSs (E-CCWSs) and compared with a system using traditional chemical processes (C-CCWSs). The corrosion characteristics, corrosion products, and corrosion mechanism of carbon steel have been studied using various testing methods, including the weight loss method, electrochemical testing, Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM), Advanced Mineral Identification and Characterization System (AMICS), etc. The research showed that the corrosion behavior of carbon steel in a circulating water system was similar and could be divided into three stages: the initial stage (corrosion rate increased), middle stage (corrosion rate slowed down gradually), and later stage (corrosion rate was stable). Owing to the lack of the corrosion inhibitor film, the corrosion rate of carbon steel in the electrochemical circulating water system was faster in the initial stage. However, the rapidly thickened corrosion product layer had a protective effect on the carbon steel. The corrosion of carbon steel entered the middle and late stages faster, and the corrosion rate decreased rapidly and tended to stabilize.

Sediments are invaluable archives of past ecosystem changes. By analyzing variations in 210Pb and other geochemical indicators in sediment cores, it is possible to assess how susceptible lakes are to the impacts of climate change and human-induced pollution, which is crucial for urban planning and the management of lake environments. This study investigated the status of heavy metal pollution in Lake Longquan, Chengdu City, and reconstructed the historical evolution of its ecological environment using 210Pb dating. Three main conclusions are drawn. (1) Currently, Cd, Cu, Pb, Zn, Cr, and organic matter in the surface sediments of Lake Longquan are highly enriched in the southeastern, central, and northeastern regions. Cd levels even reach 1.54 mg/kg in the southeastern part of the lake near the town. The high overlap of heavy metal distribution with historical aquaculture areas and some tourist areas indicates that aquaculture and tourism are important sources of heavy metals that increase their bioavailability. (2) Lake Longquan is currently at a high potential ecological risk level, and the high potential risk level of Cd may cause ecological safety problems. The biological toxicity of As should be considered, too. (3) The risk evolution in Lake Longquan can be divided into six stages: (i) Before 1977, the ancient river. With the destruction of forest vegetation and the intensification of rock weathering, ecological risks increased. (ii) 1977–1989, construction and development. Due to human factors and the joint influence of heavy precipitation events, ecological risks increased; and (iii) 1989–2010, development prioritized protection. Due to the ineffective implementation of protection policies, aquaculture increases risks. (iv) 2010–2017, development. As a provincial resort and tourism area, the significant increase in human activities has led to constantly rising sedimentation rates and heavy metal concentrations, resulting in an ecological risk peak. (v) 2017–2020, protection. The efficient implementation of lake protection and restoration policies proved to be effective, and the ecological risk started to decrease. (vi) After 2020, protective development. The government's plan to reduce fertilizer usage and increase forest cover will help control ecological risks.

The results show that the modified DDF-DEA model can explore China's IEE more accurately under SDGs. China's IEE is more stable from 2015 to 2021, with the efficiency value always fluctuating between 0.59 and 0.64, the overall level is low, and there is more room for improvement. There are significant inter-provincial differences in IEE and efficiency inertia. In more than 75% of the provinces SDG7E constrains IEE improvement, while the dynamic evolution of IEE and its subsystem efficiency varies across regions. Environmental regulation is a common factor affecting IEE across the country and in the east, central, and west regions, whereas the level of economic development, openness to the outside world, and urbanization rate are differential factors affecting IEE across the country and in the three major regions. This study offers new perspectives for exploring the path of IEE enhancement and providing empirical references for the collaborative construction of industrial ecological civilization.

A dual-functional heterojunction photocatalyst was prepared by combining tungsten oxide (WO3, the main photocatalyst) and iron oxide (Fe3O4, a visible light absorber) on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) support. The 10% rGO-WO3/Fe3O4 catalyst decomposes malachite green in 6 h and reduces Cr(VI) to Cr(III) in 2 h (both at 100 ppm). A mixed solution of MG and Cr(VI) required treatment for only 2 h, showing that the intermediates generated during the reaction positively synergized with each other. Here, the junction of WO3 and Fe3O4, which strongly induces a Z-scheme charge transfer, facilitates photo-charge separation and suppresses exciton recombination. The rGO extended the photocatalytic activity while continuously supplying electrons to the valence band of WO3. Finally, the rGO-WO3/Fe3O4 catalyst was completely recovered after the reaction using a magnet. Ultimately, this system will be useful for the quick, clean, and safe treatment of wastewater containing toxic heavy metals and organic pollutants.

Herein, the AgPt bimetallic alloy nanoparticles with small amounts of Pt were decorated on g-C3N4 nanosheets (AP-CN) via the NaBH4 reduction method, which were further used as catalysts towards photocatalytic hydrogen evolution from water under AM1.5 irradiation. Compared to mono-metallic co-catalysts, bimetallic AgPt alloy nanoparticles exhibited excellent co-catalytic performance. The optimum AP-CN photocatalyst with 0.5 wt% Pt exhibited photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 3507.89 μmol g−1·h−1, which even surpassed that of the commonly-used photocatalyst 1.0 wt% Pt in-situ photo-deposited on g-C3N4. Meanwhile, the AP-CN showed excellent photocatalytic activity and durability after four experimental cycles. The enhanced activity and stability could be attributed to the synergistic effect between plasmonic metal Ag and Pt, which promoted the transfer and separation of photoinduced charge carriers. Besides, the theoretical results based on DFT calculation also verified that AgPt alloys have better performance of desorbing hydrogen and adsorbing H atoms. This work provides a feasible idea for the development of inexpensive and efficient bimetallic co-catalysts for photocatalytic hydrogen production through water splitting.

Various characterization techniques were conducted to determine the properties of the resulting nanophotocatalysts synthesized at different weighted ratios. The CeO2/Bi24O31Cl10/Bi3O4Cl-MCSH nanophotocatalyst which weighted ratio of CeO2 to Bi24O31Cl10/Bi3O4Cl is 3:1 showed a broad absorption range in the sunlight region and demonstrated tremendous performance in the removal of emerging contaminants such as norfloxacin (NOR) (87.6%), levofloxacin (70.2%), ofloxacin (66.2%) and ciprofloxacin-HCl (57.9%) after 180 min irradiation. In contrast, the CeO2/Bi24O31Cl10/Bi3O4Cl (3:1)-MCH sample, without ultrasound irradiation nanophotocatalyst, showed lower photocatalytic destruction such as norfloxacin 77.3%. As a result, it can be said that the presence of ultrasonic energy has led to particle size reduction and increased dispersion, resulting in a decrease in peak intensity based on XRD analysis. The DRS analysis showed that the optimal nanocomposite exhibited two distinct absorption edges at 415.6 and 487.8 nm, indicating that the desired composite had indeed been formed as well as the TEM signifies a consistent and evenly dispersed distribution of CeO2 particles and Bi24O31Cl10/Bi3O4Cl plates of nanomaterial's prepared with ultrasound energy.

Here we demonstrated that removal of heavy metals through adsorption at low pH was achievable with the use of ε-MnO2 adsorbent, which could be produced in a simple one-step process. The material, which was negatively charged even at pH 2, exhibited outstanding potential for the removal of heavy metals at strongly acidic pH. At pH 2, adsorption capacities were achieved of 172.14 mg/g towards Pb2+ (at an initial concentration of 400 mg/L), 65.64 mg/g for Fe3+ (at 300 mg/L) and 8.5 mg/g for Cd2+ (at 10 mg/L). Mechanistic studies revealed that ion exchange was the main adsorption mechanism for removal of Pb2+, while electrostatic interaction was dominant for Fe3+ and Cd2+ removal. In the case of Pb2+ adsorption, double corner sharing (DCS) complexes were formed at the edges, which promoted the dissolution of structural Mn(III), thereby generating Mn2+ and vacancies which promoted Pb2+ adsorption via an ion exchange process. In the case of Fe3+ and Cd2+ adsorption, along with electrostatic adsorption, triangle corner sharing (TCS) dominated complex formation at the intermediate vacancies, and less Mn2+ was released. Note that the Mn2+ was in dynamic equilibrium with structural Mn(Ⅲ) and Mn(Ⅳ). The actual AMD was retreated in 5 cycles by ε-MnO2, the removal rates of 100% were achieved for Pb2+, Fe(total) and Mn2+, together with 98% for Cu2+ and 95.1% for Cd2+, all of which reached the national emission standards. This approach is a highly suitable option for AMD treatment that avoids toxic sludge formation.

Notably, biochar co-doped with metals and heteroatoms exhibits enhanced active sites and a greater affinity for pollutants compared to biochar doped solely with either metals or heteroatoms. This study involved synthesizing N/Ca single-doped and co-doped biochar through direct and active doping techniques, exploring their structural alterations and adsorption mechanisms. The findings reveal that doping with heteroatoms (N) and metals (Ca) primarily leads to a heterocyclic reconfiguration of the carbon framework. This reconfiguration facilitates the integration of metal ions into the carbon matrix via oxidative coordination. The maximum adsorption capacity of the Ca/N co-doped biochar for phosphorus was measured to be 145.47 mg/g. The interaction between N-containing heterocycles and Ca ligand structures on the biochar surface significantly boosts phosphorus removal, achieving synergistic adsorption effects (1 + 1>2). Key mechanisms driving this efficient adsorption include pore filling, hydrogen bonding, anion-π interactions, ligand exchange, and chemical precipitation. These insights provide a comprehensive understanding of the structural modifications necessary for optimizing phosphorus adsorption in biochar.

This study uses an innovative hybrid approach that integrates the Meta-frontier Super-SBM model and the Tobit model to address both efficiency and the factors that contribute to regional disparities in UWRUE across different technological frontiers. Our research not only uncovers significant inefficiencies in UWRUE but also identifies critical regional differences rooted in CWRUC, and reveals the resource curse effect in the YRB. Additionally, the analysis highlights that scale efficiency plays a more pivotal role for improving UWRUE than pure technical efficiency. One of the key contributions of this paper is the identification of the U-shaped relationship between disposable income and UWRUE, alongside the negative marginal impact of population density. Importantly, this study differentiates between the U-shaped relationship between industrial development and UWRUE in the midstream and downstream regions and the inverted U-shaped relationship observed in the upstream region.

Our research combines extensive hydrological data collected from the Thames Basin with advanced machine learning, where a complex network of rivers and streams substantially affects groundwater dynamics. Unlike previous studies, this research focuses on long-term forecasting with deep learning, offering, for the first time, a 60-day prediction horizon based on daily data. To rigorously examine the model performance and robustness on new, unseen data, we applied the walk-forward validation method and other matrices such as RMSE and R2 coupled with the Holdout technique. The models used were Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Attention-based LSTM, LSTM with Bayesian optimisation, Attention-based LSTM with Bayesian optimisation and TFT. They were used on the basin's Chalk, Jurassic Limestone, and Lower greensand aquifers. Whilst both LSTM models were optimised using the Bayesian technique, TFT was applied for its inherent capability in complex time series. Our methodology processed historical groundwater and rainfall data from 2001 to 2023, accounting for the potential lag in aquifer response to the proximity of the river system. The dataset served as training, validation, and holdout for each model, focusing on capturing the dynamic temporal fluctuation. The results clearly showed the superiority of the TFT model in all aquifer types compared to other models across all horizons. The Limestone had the greatest result in the 7-day projections, with an RMSE of 0.02 and R2 of 0.98; Whilst the Chalk and Lower greensand, had RMSEs of 0.03 with R2 values of 0.75 and 0.95, respectively. The Limestone aquifer performed best for the 30-day horizon again (RMSE = 0.06, R2 = 0.85), with the Chalk and Lower greensand aquifer yielding RMSE of 0.04 and 0.12 and R2 values of 0.64 and 0.74, respectively. In the 60 days predictions, the best results were observed in the limestone aquifer with RMSE of 0.09 and R2 of 0.65 in holdout validation. However, in chalk and lower greensand aquifers, the TFT showed RMSEs of 0.05 and 0.15 and R2s of 0.45 and 0.58, respectively. Traditional LSTM models demonstrated limited predictive power compared to the main model TFT, while the attention mechanism slightly improved the accuracy.

However, the highly crosslinked molecular networks make the internal structures inaccessible, significantly restricting their adsorption capacity. This work reports the development of a porous polyvinyl formal–Linze palygorskite composite fabricated via a polyvinyl acetal reaction using inorganic salts as porogens. The resulting pore structure provides well-developed molecule/ion-transfer paths, enabling the efficient utilization of active sites in the bulk phase and facilitating complete internal adsorption. The optimal sample, P-PVFM-LZ, which was prepared with 5% NaCl by weight relative to Linze palygorskite and subsequently washed to remove the NaCl porogen, exhibited a distinct pore structure with a 44.0% higher specific surface area and 8.6% higher porosity than the composite prepared without NaCl (PVFM-LZ).

In this work, a heterogeneous electro-Fenton system using a pyrite-modified carbon felt as the cathode (EF-FeS2-CF) was constructed to remove CLQ. EF-FeS2-CF was found to achieve 92.4 ± 0.1% removal of 5 mg/L CLQ after 30 min at 20 mA and exhibited an outstanding catalytic performance for CLQ removal in wide ranges of operating conditions, excellent recyclability with low iron leaching (>90% 30-min CLQ removal efficiency for all five cyclic experiments which led to only an accumulative Fe loss of <0.3%) and remarkable application potential in different aqueous environments without any pH adjustment. Both O2 •- and •OH were found to greatly contribute to CLQ degradation while the latter played a major role (>50% CLQ removal). To describe CLQ degradation towards complete mineralization in EF-FeS2-CF, three CLQ degradation paths were proposed based on the main degradation intermediates identified with generally lower ecotoxicities.

Both water supply companies (WSCs) and water supply and sewage companies (WSSCs) produce and deliver potable water for city dwellers. Water authorities use benchmarks to monitor the two types of companies' operations. The internal operation process and heterogeneities of observations were not considered for relative performance evaluation by conventional DEA models. To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a union dynamic multi-activity network data envelopment analysis (UDMANDEA) model to extend static network DEA to a more general case for dynamic efficiency assessment of the water supply operations of water companies. For the first time, the model allows for the decomposition of the water supply operation into water production (WP) and water consumption (WC) substages and performance comparisons for water companies by considering their heterogeneity simultaneously. Specifically, by using a non-radial directional distance function (DDF), the inefficiencies for substages and the entire system can be both assessed dynamically. This model is applied to a sample of 246 water companies in China in 2016–2018. The overall, period, and substages’ group efficiencies, meta efficiency, and technology gap ratio (TGR) for 179 WSCs and 67 WSSCs are all provided. The empirical results reveal that: (1) the average group efficiencies of WSCs and WSSCs are 0.4567 and 0.6611, respectively. The meta efficiencies of WSCs and WSSCs are 0.4523 and 0.4703, respectively. The TGR of WSCs (0.994) is greater than that of WSSCs (0.7067). (2) WSSCs perform better than WSCs do, which suggests that economies of scope do exist in WSSCs. However, WSCs possess the best technology for water supply operations because of their high TGR. (3) The average meta efficiency for all the observed water companies (0.4572) is not optimistic, which correlates more with inefficiency in the WP stage. The causes stem from the natural monopoly, lack of competition, and relatively lower water tariffs. The Chinese water supply industry requires diversification of ownership and operation modes, and gradual increases in water tariffs.

Proximate analysis revealed MMBC's stability (low moisture: 6.48%, high fixed carbon: 54.7%) and high adsorption potential (low volatile matter: 9.77%). Characterization techniques (SEM-EDX, XRD, FTIR, TGA) confirmed a desirable porous structure, favorable chemical composition, and surface functionality critical for As(V) adsorption.

The results showed that the sustained-release interaction system in HCO3 − type groundwater exhibited a greater retardation effect (K d = 0.73 cm3 g−1) on PFOA compared to the interaction system under no ions condition (K d = 0.49 cm3 g−1) or microbe system (K d = 0.43 cm3 g−1). Moreover, the reaction rate λ of PFOA exhibited minimal fluctuation in HCO3 − type groundwater, indicating lower competition from HCO3 − ions for occupancy site and resulting in less PFOA repulsed to the lower reactive region (with lower Fe2+ and microorganism cells concentrations). Furthermore, the retardation effect for PFOA was boosted by secondary minerals-microbe interaction and joint adsorption. HCO3 − facilitated the minerals-microbes interaction, leading to increased formation of β-FeOOH and improved retardation effect for PFOA. Additionally, the functional microorganisms Pseudomonas and Delftia were combined to drive the Fe3+/Fe2+ cycle and PFOA biochemical transformation. The two-dimensional spatiotemporal evolution simulation results showed that pollutant flux (transport risk) of PFOA in HCO3 − type groundwater system (0.124 × 10−3 mg·(m2·s)−1) can be reduced by 23.0% compared to that in NO3 − type groundwater system (0.161 × 10−3 mg·(m2·s)−1). This study quantitatively revealed the coupling effect of minerals, microbes, and ions on PFOA, contributing to optimizing the sustained-release system for effectively remediating different types of PFOA-contaminated groundwater.

The effect of WAS pre-treatment with different surfactants on membrane performance were investigated in terms of flux variation, membrane rejection and fouling mechanisms. A generalization form of blocking law was developed to determine membrane fouling mechanism. According to the results, cationic surfactant below critical micelle concentration (CMC) values improved membrane performance, while anionic and non-ionic surfactant showed a negative impact at all dosages. It was observed that WAS pretreatment with 300 mg/L Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) could increase the water flux from 195 to 611 L/m2/h (LMH) and decrease the rejection rate from 93% to 85%, respectively. Although CTAB addition increased the total extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) amount from 56.16 to 119.6 mg/L which was due to the surfactant solubilization property, the total resistance decreased from 0.33 × 1010 to 0.11 × 1010 m−1. This was attributed to the flock formation induced by CTAB through charge neutralization and bridging mechanism. Modeling simulation of the results indicated that CTAB addition transformed fouling mechanism from cake to intermediate-blocking model. The environmental risk assessment revealed that only 0.3 mg/L surfactant penetrated in permeate which was low ecological risk (risk quotients (RQ) < 0.5) to the aquatic environment. Our finding suggested CTAB treatment at low dosage (0.1 g/L) as a promising and efficient approach for fouling mitigation and improving membrane process for wastewater treatment.

In particular, coagulation-settling stage often faces multiple disturbances and time lags, which lower the efficiency because coagulant dosage cannot be accurately calculated in real-time based on the effluent turbidity. To address this issue, we developed a method using deep learning image recognition to monitor the coagulation-settling stage in real-time. For that we used 5761 operational data and images of flocs from the sedimentation tank of a DWTP in East China in 2022, to build an image recognition regression model that predict the turbidity of the sedimentation tank effluent. Results show that our deep learning regression model, performs better with r-square (R2) of 0.97, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.016 and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 2.74%, compared with the traditional machine learning giving R2 of 0.76, MAE of 0.045 and MAPE of 8.26%. The model also avoids misclassification at different turbidity intervals. The incorporation operational data of the sedimentation tank, prediction accuracy is improved by 79.6%. By adjusting the turbidity data to correct time misalignment, our model effectively handles the time lag caused by the hydraulic retention time of the sedimentation tank, thus enhancing the timeliness and accuracy of its practical application.

The compressor is employed to create a low-pressure environment for seawater, and the compression heat is recovered by a multi-effect desalination subsystem to produce freshwater. A comprehensive comparison is conducted between this system and conventional systems, considering thermodynamic, economic, and environmental aspects.

However, the highly fluctuating NH4 +-N levels in raw water may pose a challenge to a stable nitrification process. It is unclear how the DSB reactor contends with NH4 +-N deficiency. This study evaluated the robustness of a DSB reactor under long-term NH4 +-N abundant and NH4 +-N deficient conditions. Four NH4 +-N deficient periods were investigated, comprising two 14-day partial NH4 +-N deficient phases, one 56-day phase involving both partial and complete NH4 +-N deficient, and one 90-day complete NH4 +-N deficient phase. Repeated 14-day partial NH4 +-N deficient phases had no impact on nitrification performance. However, shifting from partial to complete NH4 +-N deficient condition resulted in a delay in NOx−-N production when NH4 +-N was replenished. Following an additional 90 days of NH4 +-N deficient phase, NH4 +-N removal performance recovered faster than nitrite (NO2 −-N) removal performance, which took 5 and 29 days, respectively. Furthermore, long-term NH4 +-N deficiency resulted in a nominal loss of biomass in the DSB reactor. These findings suggested that the nitrification capacity of the DSB reactor is robust when subjected to long-term NH4 +-N deficient conditions. The 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing results revealed that the growth of Nitrosomonas was suppressed, but Candidatus Nitrosotenuis predominated in NH4 +-N deficient conditions, while Nitrospira persisted throughout the study. The observed persistence of Nitrospira may be attributed to their diverse metabolic capabilities, which include mixotrophy and complete ammonia oxidation metabolisms. Collectively, the co-existence of Ca. Nitrosotenius, Nitrosomonas, and Nitrospira contributed to stable NH4 +-N removal performance in the robust DSB reactor. The DSB reactor shows promise for use in raw water treatment with highly fluctuating NH4 +-N availability.

Conventional water quality parameter monitoring and simple analysis may not adequately reflect complex changes in distribution. Machine learning (ML) excels at uncovering the intricate relationships among these. Although some reviews exist on ML in water resources, a systematic assessment of water quality in water distribution systems is lacking. The current review offers the first critical and comprehensive review of the application of ML in water quality management within water distribution systems, including water quality prediction, anomaly detection, and contamination source identification, and addresses the associated challenges and future directions. To be specific, for water quality prediction, the focus is on chlorine, disinfection by-products, microbial indicators, heavy metals, and sensory properties. The implementation of ML has the potential to reduce the cost of water quality monitoring and offer knowledge discovery. For anomaly detection, semi-supervised, supervised, and unsupervised models are reviewed. Changes in one or more surrogate water quality parameters measured by low-cost sensors can effectively indicate anomalous events. For contamination source identification, ML demonstrates its superiority in rapidly and accurately locating contamination sources. Additionally, dataset availability, interpretability, generalization capability, integrated models, real-time response and proactive decision have been identified as key areas for implementing ML.

Herein, pursuing a balance among mechanical, planting, and water purification property, chitosan/biochar-modified eco-concrete (CBEC) was prepared as a new sustainable alternative for riparian protection, ecological restoration and water quality improvement. Compressive strength of CBEC with an optimized chitosan/biochar content of 6% could reach up to 14.05 MPa, meeting the requirements for stabilizing riparian slopes. Micromorphology characterization and porosity measurement (29.63%) confirmed the abundantly porous structure of CBEC, facilitating the soil-water nutrient exchange, plant growth and microbial attachment. The 30-d water tank cultivation observed that the physiological parameters of T. orientalis planted in CBEC, including biomass, chlorophyll, protein and starch, were greatly improved compared to unmodified eco-concrete (EC). Moreover, compared to EC, biochar-modified EC and chitosan-modified EC, the planting CBEC could most effectively decrease the levels of TN, NH4 +-N, TP, and COD by 53.82%, 62.50%, 88.31%, and 57.95%, respectively. Specially, the planting CBEC could degrade a common but recalcitrant pesticide nitenpyram (NTP) by 32.83% into low-toxic substances, recognized by LC-MS analysis. Microbiological analysis revealed that CBEC greatly promoted the proliferation of both nutrient-transforming bacteria (e.g., Nitrospira and Pseudomonas) and some specific species dominating NTP degradation (e.g., Rhodococcus and Bacillus). Also, PICRUSt2 prediction results identified the enrichment of functional genes related to nitrogen and phosphorus transformation.

Microbial fuel cell powered electro-Fenton system (MFCⓅEFs) has been demonstrated to generate •OH and destroy hydrophilic extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) as an improved method of high efficiency and low energy consumption. Nevertheless, the smaller particle size of the treated sludge and the release of partial organic matter into the supernatant can affect the sludge-water separation process. Chitosan quaternary ammonium salt (CQAS) as a renewable and biodegradability cationic coagulant can be involved in the follow-up treatment. The sludge after combined treatment exhibited better dewaterability, where the water content of sludge cake (WCSC), capillary suction time (CST), and specific resistance filtration (SRF) were 61.21%, 15.6 s, and 1.02 × 1012 m/kg (26.47%, 80.72% and 84.28% reduction), respectively. The oxidation of the MFCⓅEFs destroyed the cellular and EPS structure and the bridging flocculation and charge neutralization of CQAS caused the fine particles to squeeze each other. The combined treatment fully reduced the content of negative charge and hydrophilic substances on the surface, which affected the intensity change of N-H bond and altered the protein secondary structure to make it looser, thus releasing more bound water while improving aggregation characteristics. Overall, combined treatment can significantly improve sludge dewaterability and owns operational advantages of high efficiency, low energy and chemical consumption, safety, and non-toxicity.

Traditional energy performance assessments in the water industry often overlook heterogeneity among water companies and fail to account for changes in energy efficiency (EE) over time. To address these shortcomings, this research employs Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) techniques to assess energy performance of two types of water companies such as Water and Sewerage Companies (WaSCs) and Water-only Companies (WoCs) within a single energy frontier model. Empirical analysis of water companies in England and Wales reveals an average EE score of 0.940 over the 2010–2020 period, suggesting a 6% energy-saving potential. English and Welsh water industry exhibited an overall 0.3% annual improvement in energy productivity change (EPC). This improvement was primarily attributed to efficiency changes (average 1.005), which offset the negative shift in technology change (average 0.998), while the scale effect remained negligible (average 1.000). WaSCs experienced a slight increase in EPC, with an average value of 1.018, indicating an improvement in energy productivity. In contrast, WoCs exhibited a decrease in EPC, with an average value of 0.989, suggesting a decline in energy productivity. These disparities were due to opposite shifts in the efficient production frontier; WaSCs had a positive shift (average 1.012), while WoCs had a negative shift (average 0.984). The study also highlights the impact of regulatory policies on energy performance. The 2009 price review involved modest improvements (average EPC = 1.013), while the 2014 price review yielded unfavorable results (average EPC = 0.993), emphasizing the need for long-term policies to facilitate sector-wide transformation towards carbon neutrality.";"2024-11-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624035868";"1";"Water Refinement"

This study designed a prepositioned double short-cut sulfur autotrophic denitrification (DSSADN) system integrated with PN/Anammox, achieving simultaneous sulfur recovery and complete autotrophic denitrification. It also examined the impact of reflux changes on the nitrogen and sulfur transformation characteristics in the coupled system when treating ammonia and sulfur-containing wastewater. Results indicate that the coupling of DSSADN zone (zone C1) enhanced TN removal by PN/Anammox, with the TN removal rate (TNRRT), TN removal efficiency (TNRET), and S2− removal rate reaching 0.54 kg/(m³·d), 95.1%, and 100%, respectively. The NO2 −-N accumulation efficiency (NiAEC1) of DSSADN reached 87.1%, with ΔSO4 2--S consistently less than 11.8 mg/L, and the S0 accumulation efficiency (S0AEC1) reaching 82.4%. A small amount of O2 carried in the reflux can effectively reduce residual S2− in zone C1, preventing its entry into the PN/Anammox zone (zone C2) and mitigating its toxic effects on Anammox. However, O2 also increases the expression of soxB in zone C1, causing more S2− to be oxidized to SO4 2−, and reducing S0AEC1. When DOC1 was between 0.05 mg/L and 0.34 mg/L, nirK expression was significantly increased, and the abundance of related functional microorganisms changed, led to more NO3 −-N being reduced to N2. When DOC1 exceeds 0.34 mg/L, it inhibits the denitrification process, leading to elevated NiAE.

To better prepare in planning and responding to such events, computational models that capture the intrusion and health impact dynamics are needed. This study presents a novel benchmark testbed that integrates current knowledge on pathogen transport and fate in chlorinated systems and can assess infection risk from contamination events. The model considers organic matter degradation, chlorine decay mechanisms, pathogen inactivation kinetics, as well as stochastic water demands. We studied modeling of wastewater intrusion events that can occur anywhere within a chlorinated and non-chlorinated network. We applied the Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment framework focusing on three pathogens: enterovirus, Campylobacter, and Cryptosporidium, and their respective dose-response models. Synthetic household-level water demand time series were used to model the individual water consumption timing and calculate the infection risk (exposure via ingestion). Model outcomes indicate that while chlorination aids mitigation, larger contaminations can still lead to infections due to chlorine resistance (for Cryptosporidium) and chlorine depletion at the contamination point. In our example scenarios, chlorine-susceptible pathogens infected 0.78 – 26.6 % of the downstream population, while chlorine-resistant ones infected the entire downstream population. Enterovirus infection risk is higher, despite the concentrations in the contamination source being lower, due to the lower susceptibility to chlorine than Campylobacter. In non-chlorinated networks, the modeled wastewater contamination events led to 11 – 46 % infection risk in the total population, depending on the contamination location. Hydraulic uncertainty had a limited influence on infection risk. Furthermore, Campylobacter's infection risk is more sensitive to the initial concentration in the contamination source whereas enterovirus infection risk to the inactivation rate. The model further indicates that the time window for effective mitigation of the magnitude of a waterborne outbreak is short (within hours).";"2024-11-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624034462";"1";"Water Refinement"

The UF process is a dominant pretreatment method to reduce HAB fouling potential in subsequent SWRO processes. Herein, we systematically evaluate the UF membrane fouling characteristics at different growth phases of HAB algae in terms of reversible/irreversible fouling and pinpoint the fouling mechanisms on UF membranes in the real seawater matrix. We employed Prorocentrum donghaiense as a model marine HAB specie to characterize algal derivatives, including extracellular organic matter (EOM) and granule particles. LC-OCD, MFIs, 3D-EEM, and GPC were used to analyze algae-derived matters. Results from the multiple fouling model revealed that algal solution in both stationary and decline phases exhibit severe membrane fouling, characterized by rapid cake layer formation, swift flux decline, and high membrane resistance. Soluble EOM (S-EOM) was the primary contributor to membrane fouling, linked to its elevated concentrations of dissolved organic matters, polysaccharides, proteins, and humic substances, which are predominantly hydrophobic. Additionally, granule particles mitigated organic membrane fouling, as evidenced by the smaller permeate volume required for S-EOM cake layer formation (<5 mL), resulting in a faster initial flux decline. These results revealed a shift in released organic matter from protein-centric to humic substance-centric during the transition from exponential growth to the decline phase, with correlation analysis further underscoring the substantial contribution of humic substances to membrane resistance.

The results indicated that altering ethanol solvent preparation concentrations modulates the morphological characteristics, surface functional groups, and photochemical attributes of co-solvent HTCC materials. HTCC prepared using an 80 wt% ethanol solvent concentration demonstrated the most efficient TMP photocatalytic degradation (>90%).

The analysis also reveals that neither the volume of wastewater treated nor the type of reactor used for secondary treatment has a significant impact on the CE of the facilities. The CE metric proposed in this study serves as an important decision-support tool for advancing towards the carbon neutrality of wastewater treatment processes. By providing a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental performance of WWTPs, it helps identifying areas for improvement and guiding policy and operational decisions.

In order to sustainably manage watershed water resources, it is necessary to accurately assess the available water volume to meet the coordinated management of the watershed's socio-economic subsystem and eco-environment subsystem. The amount of Bluewater resources (BW) is closely related to the amount of Greenwater resources (GW). BW is directly related to human consumption in the socio-economic subsystem, while GW is used to maintain the health of the ecosystem. A method called the integrated simulation-optimization modeling system (ISOMS) was developed to evaluate adaptive strategies for dealing with the combined effects of climate change and land-use changes. ISOMS not only predicts future hydrological trends under varying environmental conditions but also generates comprehensive risk management plans that incorporate different types of uncertainties, including random and fuzzy factors. The Copula function is introduced to handle the interaction between available BW and available GW. The results showed that: (i) uncertainties in the hydrologic system could result in alterations to the distribution of water resources; (ii) system benefits are, to some extent, affected by land use change and climate change; (iii) the shortage of BW is affected by the level of risk, and the joint risk increases, resulting in an increase in water scarcity; (iv) the planned annual agricultural water consumption is the highest, followed by domestic water consumption, and industrial water consumption is the lowest. Through the results of the model operation, the joint risk assessment and adaptive management of BW and GW in the East River Basin (ERB) under changing environments, as well as the BW allocation plan, are obtained to provide support for scientific and reasonable resource collaborative decision-making and promote the synchronized advancement of the socio-economic subsystem and eco-environment subsystem in the ERB.

A calibrated water quality model within the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) was used to simulate total suspended solids (TSS) and nutrients loads under different future land use scenarios. The first scenario reflects maximum urban development according to current legislation. An alternative scenario was proposed considering the protection of forest remnants and the adoption of the most cost-effective GBI techniques in newly developed areas. Results indicated a substantial contribution of diffuse pollution to the reservoir's water quality degradation, mainly due to TSS loads transported from the most urbanized subcatchments. The application of bioretention cells to treat 12.6 km2 new impervious areas effectively mitigated diffuse pollution, removing 52.1% of TSS, 19.5% of total phosphorus (TP), and 17.1% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) loads flowing into the reservoir.

Taking a sponge campus in Xi'an as the research object, this paper proposes a method to realize the interaction between surface water and groundwater at different spatial and temporal scales, so as to construct a SWMM-MODFLOW coupled numerical model to carry out the analysis of hydrological effect of sponge city comprehensively taking into account both surface water and groundwater. Simultaneously, the SWMM is coupled with the NSGA-III algorithm for multi-objective optimization of LID facility configurations, aiming to identify a globally optimal solution set for LID facility configurations under both long and short-duration rainfall scenarios. A novel framework for a comprehensive evaluation system of surface water-groundwater benefits is also developed to comprehensively assess LID facility optimization schemes that meet the goals of stormwater runoff infiltration and reduction, pollution interception and purification, and groundwater recharge conservation. The simulation results show that after optimization, the LID scheme has good surface runoff regulation effects and pollution reduction capabilities, reducing the runoff peak from 2.297 m3/s to 2.128 m3/s, significantly lowering the risk of inundation and effectively reducing the total suspended solids (SS) load by 42.38 kg at the outfall. Meanwhile, the groundwater recharge effect is particularly significant in September. Compared to the baseline scenario, the average groundwater levels from June to September were raised by 3.966 cm, 5.120 cm, 6.743 cm, and 7.639 cm, respectively. The maximum daily groundwater level rise reached 7.82 cm, while the average groundwater level for the whole year of 2023 increased by 2.61 cm. The maximum transport area of pollutants decreased from 2359.44 m2 to 1796.54 m2, and the maximum transport distance reduced from 79.985 m to 69.977 m. Additionally, the central concentration of pollutants also decreased. This optimization evaluation framework will aid decision-makers in selecting LID facility management strategies that balance the dual benefits of surface water runoff and groundwater regulation.

Evidence from the global hydropower industry ";" Amidst urgent global calls for sustainable development, the diffusion of green technology emerges as a pivotal challenge, especially in our interconnected and dynamic digital era. Therefore, this research explores the drivers of green technology diffusion, moving from the traditional binary view of organizational proximity to a more nuanced trend of intricate and dynamic interactions within inter-organizational networks. We introduce a conceptual model to examine the influence of competition and collaboration on green technology diffusion, employing an inter-organizational network perspective. Our empirical study, targeting the global hydropower industry from 1999 to 2018, employs multi-source heterogeneous network analysis and quadratic assignment procedure regression. The findings reveal that during the industry's growth phase, collaboration plays a more significant role in green technology diffusion than competition. Conversely, in the maturity phase, competition emerges as the primary positive influence. Additionally, geographical distance is found to positively moderate the relationship between both competition and collaboration in green technology diffusion. These insights enhance our understanding of the drivers of green technology diffusion and provide policy recommendations for promoting such diffusion through inter-organizational competition and collaboration in the new area.

Herein, we reported a novel porous membrane composed of ultrafine FeMn bimetallic nanoparticles anchored in nitrogen-doped carbon nanofibers (FeMn/N-CNF) obtained through a facile electrospinning-carbonization process. The strong metal-support interaction (SMSI) phenomena including carbon encapsulation structure and electron transfer from metal to N-CNF, beneficial to the intrinsic activities, were successfully induced by the enhanced interfacial metal-nitrogen bonding in FeMn/N-CNF. Microstructural characterizations and leaching test revealed that the SMSI encapsulation structure could promote the formation of ultrafine FeMn nanoparticles in N-CNF during the high-temperature carbonization process and prevent leaching of active Fe/Mn metals into solution across a wide pH range. The constructed gravity-driven flow-through electro-Fenton system based on a FeMn/N-CNF cathode membrane exhibited superior performance to generate H2O2 (36.23 mmol L−1 h−1) and subsequent activate H2O2 decomposition to hydroxyl radicals (0.1024 min−1), achieving remarkable degradation efficiencies of 96.8%, 92.3%, and 90.3% within 60 min for Rhodamine B, Tetracycline, and Methyl Orange, respectively. Furthermore, the FeMn/N-CNF membrane filter demonstrated good pH adaptability, excellent cycle stability and anti-scaling ability during the degradation process.

These processes included microfiltration and ultrafiltration for the removal of solids and large organic molecules, selective electrodialysis for the recovery of nutrients, UV ozonation to selectively oxidize pharmaceuticals and reverse osmosis for clean water production. Results showed that 48–58% of the digestate could be recovered as water that can be used for irrigation or process needs, while 51–67.8% of nitrogen could be recovered by the selective electrodialysis process and used for fertilizer production tailored to farmers’ soil and crop requirements, aiming to replace fertilizers from non-renewable minerals. Applying UV ozonation for the oxidation of pharmaceuticals before the nutrient recovery step was found to be twice as effective as applying it after nutrient recovery. The solid fractions of various digestates were applied as fertilizers for lettuce grown in pots, with the digestate from agricultural and food waste origins giving some of the best yields with the lowest GHG emissions. The solid fraction from sewage sludge digestate produced the highest yields in lettuce growing, but also resulted in much higher GHG emissions than the other fertilizers. A business model for the implementation of the developed technology in three operational scenarios concluded that a mobile solution shared between small anaerobic digestion plants in a region could have a five-year return on investment of 41.6% and a payback period of 1.96 years.

However, previous virtual scarce water models were inadequate for the analysis of both water quantity and quality, and only provided a rough estimate. To address this problem, we proposed a modification of this model. In the revised model, we determined the scarcity induced by inadequate water quality by analyzing the availability of suitable quality water for specific sectors (residential, industrial, agricultural, and environmental) rather than focusing on a single sector (usually environmental). Additionally, the revised model evaluated scarcity from water quantity by considering clean water technologies and environmental flow demand. This comprehensive scarcity measure is then incorporated into an input–output model to determine virtual scarce water. We used two typical Chinese river basins (the Hai River and Pearl River basins) with different water endowments to evaluate the model. We found that in the water-scarcity region the virtual scarce water was more strongly affected by water quality and clean water technologies, whereas in the water-rich region it was more strongly affected by the environmental flow demand. These findings underscored the need for more targeted economic and environmental policies for different regions. Water-scarcity regions should prioritize the promotion of clean water technologies and contaminant mitigation techniques, while water-rich regions should pay more attention to ensuring the environmental flow demand.

This study investigates the removal efficiency of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) using Fe-Mn modified biochar (BFM) in fixed bed filtration columns, emphasizing the effect of the presence of polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) on SMX behavior in both water (pH ≈ 5.6) and selected wastewater (pH ≈ 8) systems. Batch sorption results show that 10 mg/L SMX in 50 mL water can be completely removed by 100 mg BFM sorbent. The Bed Depth Service Time model indicated the BFM column is feasible for SMX removal in scaled-up continuous wastewater flow operations, while the Yan model best elucidates SMX filtration behavior and suggests the dominant adsorption mechanisms include external mass transfer and intraparticle diffusion. The present of both 20 mg/L and 100 mg/L PS-MPs (pH ≈ 5.6) significantly reduced SMX retention due to competitive sorption. However, at pH 3.2, competitive sorption became negligible due to electrostatic interactions driving the PS-MPs sorption, while neutral charged SMX bound through hydrogen-bonds or π-π EDA interactions. Elevated pH shifted both PS-MPs and SMX sorption to non-electrostatic thus intensifying sorption competition, highlighting the influence of pH on their interaction dynamics. In wastewater, SMX filtration was slightly inhibited by 100 mg/L PS-MPs in BFM columns, whereas PS-MPs removal remained unaffected due to the high ionic strength and alkaline pH. These findings highlight the impact of MPs on pollution removal efficiency in filtration system, essential for enhancing biochar-based wastewater treatment strategies.

Herein, we report the preparation of two novel multifunctional Ni-based MOFs (2D and 3D), via the design and synthesis of multi-nitrogen-like ligands. The introduction of polynitrogen-containing organic macrocyclic ligands improved the structure and electron transfer capability of the MOF, and its adsorption and synergistic degradation performance were further enhanced via coordination with Ni. The 3D MOF (MOF-2) had a maximum adsorption capacity of 948 mg/g for Hg(II). The adsorption and synergistic degradation capacities of MOF-2 for tetracycline (TC, 18 mg/L), 17α-ethynylestradiol (EE2, 3 mg/L), rhodamine B (RhB, 6 mg/L), and methylene blue (MB, 6 mg/L) were 98.54%, 97.32%, 91.08%, and 85.02%, respectively. The addition of KHSO5 (PMS, 0.01 g/L) resulted in nearly 100% degradation of the organic pollutants within 100 min. MOF-2 alone simultaneously degraded more than 90.73% (360 min Hg(II) adsorption equilibrium) of five pollutants in ultrapure water, tap water, and lake water. MOF-2+PMS degraded 99.13% of TC within 60 min, and the remaining four pollutants were completely adsorbed and degraded. DFT calculations and experiments indicated that the efficient adsorption of Hg(II) and efficient degradation of the organic pollutants by MOF-2 were mainly attributed to its abundant N atoms, which provide active sites for Hg(II) capture; and the structure itself has strong electron transfer ability and self-produced reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can effectively degrade organic pollutants and activate PMS to enhance the degradation efficiency. MOF-2 also exhibited 100% antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. This work provides a basis for designing synthesis pathways for MOFs and elucidates the electron-transfer mechanism underlying the enhanced synergistic removal of complex pollutants from water.

The nanocomposite revealed a dual S-scheme heterojunction that has a broad-spectrum response, resulting in a better efficiency for the degradation of TC (97%). The synergy index during sonophotocatalysis was measured to be 2.79. Moreover, the nanocomposite was effectively used to actively regulate the concentration of TC (73.2%) and other pollutants in pharmaceutical wastewater. An extensive analysis was performed to examine the impact of various significant parameters, including pH, catalyst dosage, TC concentration, and others. Sonophotocatalysis outperforms both sonocatalysis and photocatalysis, exhibiting pseudo-first-order kinetics. The improved performance can be credited to the formation of a dual S-scheme heterojunction, which facilitates the efficient transfer and separation of charge carriers that are stimulated by visible light exposure.

Also, sustainable practices have been constantly encouraged in both sectors to mitigate water scarcity and provide resilience to cities. Thus, studies that provide an environmental assessment and discuss the decision-making process are essential for enabling the augmentation of sustainable practices. This research aims to contribute to the discussion on sustainability by conducting a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of Sustainable Urban Drainage Systems (SUDS) examples. LCA is the main methodology applied to perform environmental comparisons. First, a thorough inventory was obtained from previous works with different alternatives for water management within a university building, including drainage, paving and water supply functions. The inventory contemplates alternatives using rainwater and stormwater harvesting for non-potable water supply, including pervious pavements. Such alternatives were compared with Brazil's usual water supply systems, aiming at diminishing the total environmental burden. The methodology aspects of LCA were also regarded, such as an uncertainty assessment and a quality matrix of the processes used. Midpoint and endpoint categories were also regarded with their decision-making and uncertainty analysis. The main result is the understanding of the trade-offs between the proposed systems, with a significant reduction in water stress obtained in the alternative scenarios. However, such a decrease is accompanied by a slight increase in some impact categories. Rainwater harvesting through roofs is the most environmentally friendly alternative, although the Cultural Theory parameter definition impacts on the sustainability ranking. Alternative sustainable systems for water management still need validation in terms of LCA, while decision-making for sustainable and resilient cities also requires a robust scientific basis. Thus, in conclusion, alternative systems such as SUDS were obtained to be more sustainable than conventional paving, drainage and water supply in the case study, and the understanding of different benefits found in the LCA is important to the decision-making process.

After optimization, the MCG-PAA/CFA exhibited water absorbency capacities of 1260(±10.6) g/g and 82(±1.4) g/g in deionized water and physiological saline, respectively. After adding 3 wt% MCG, the water absorption of SAC was improved from 415 to 746 g/g. After further introduction of 2 wt% CFA, the water absorption of SAC increased from 746 to 1260 g/g. Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) analysis confirmed that the grafting reaction was successful and that CFA participated in the reaction, while scanning electron microscope (SEM) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) results revealed that the grafting reaction and the introduction of CFA improved the surface morphology and thermal stability of the SAC. Kinetic analysis was conducted to investigate how the grafting reaction and the introduction of CFA affected the swelling and water retention kinetics of the superabsorbent composite. In the soil experiment, adding only 0.1 wt% MCG-PAA/CFA can improve the water holding capacity of sandy soil, loam soil and clay soil by 6.65%, 4.42%, and 3.76% respectively This SAC composite has great potential in soil drought resistance.

But the adsorption-based desalination slows down due to slow water adsorption/desorption rates and inadequate water storage capacity in conventional adsorbents. Therefore, the restructuring of porous MOFs increases water storage and transfer rates. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation on the fabrication of ionic liquid encapsulated MIL-101 (Cr) MOFs (metal-organic frameworks), and its interactions with water for desalination applications. Firstly, the pristine MIL-101 (Cr) is encapsulated with various types/amounts of ionic liquids. Next, these MOFs are characterized via SEM (Scanning electron microscope), FTIR (Fourier transform infrared), XRD (X-ray diffraction), TGA (Thermal gravimetric analysis), N2 adsorption techniques. The water adsorption on these MOFs is performed experimentally for a wide temperature (30–80 °C) and pressure (0 < P/Ps < 0.95) ranges. The effects of the size (or type) as well as the encapsulation ratio of ionic liquids on water adsorption behaviors are conducted. Based on the experimentally proven water adsorption (isotherms and kinetics) data, an AD (adsorption desalination) system is modelled and simulated. Finally, the AD performances in terms of the specific daily water production (SDWP) and performance ratio (PR) are parametrically studied with respect to various regeneration temperature (50–80 °C) and cycle times (100 s–1000 s). It is found that by ionic liquid encapsulation, the water uptakes/offtake rates are expedited up to 48% (for adsorption)/55% (for desorption), respectively. In addition, the water transfer (Δq) improves up to 45% more than the parent MIL-101(Cr) MOFs. Furthermore, the SDWP increases from 38 to 56 m3 of water per tonne of MOFs per day at the regeneration temperature of 70 °C. The simulation results also show that the ionic-liquid-encapsulated MIL-101 (Cr) MOFs generates water (>25 m3 water per tonne of IL-MOFs) at the regeneration temperature of 50 °C and is potential for the next generation desalination applications.

The increasing demand of freshwater poses a significant challenge for the sustainable development for industrial parks. This work reviews the evolution process of park-wide water infrastructure. A superstructure-based model was used to address the trade-off between water reuse and its impact on the wastewater treatment for the evolutionary state of water infrastructure. In the evolution process of park-wide water infrastructure, five scenarios were defined based on the evolution process of water infrastructure. For wastewater treatment system, centralized or decentralized wastewater treatment plants were deployed according to the evolutionary process of park-wide water infrastructure. The relationship among freshwater consumption, wastewater treatment, and discharge quality were investigated by optimizing the configuration of park-wide water infrastructure. The results indicate that the cost of park-wide water infrastructure with centralized wastewater treatment plant is lower than that with decentralized wastewater treatment plants. Improving the effluent standards for centralized wastewater treatment increases the total cost. For regeneration and reuse, improving the effluent standard for centralized wastewater treatment does not necessarily increase the total cost. The findings indicate that improvement in the discharge standard of centralized wastewater treatment depends on the specifications of the centralized wastewater treatment.

As renewable energy adoption expands, the demand for these applications is increasing. However, water electrolysis currently faces challenges in cost competitiveness compared to other hydrogen production methods. Additionally, its reliance on potable water sources places additional strain on freshwater reserves. This study addresses these issues by exploring the economically optimal investment and operational strategy for hydrogen production using non-potable water sources. The goal is to maximize net profit through mathematical optimization, utilizing three advanced electrolysis technologies: alkaline electrolysis, proton exchange membrane electrolysis, and solid oxide electrolysis. The study examines three non-potable water sources: seawater, urban wastewater effluent, and rainwater. The model takes into account electricity market values from day-ahead and balancing markets, as well as the market values for hydrogen, oxygen, freshwater, and mixed solid salt. Two scenarios are analysed, reflecting varying levels of uncertainty in electricity price forecasts. Each scenario includes nine case studies, representing various combinations of water sources and electrolysis technologies. The results indicate that alkaline electrolysis and proton exchange membrane electrolysis are financially viable technologies, with potential annual net profits of up to 6.4 and 6.2 million euros, respectively. In contrast, solid oxide electrolysis incurs a negative net profit across all scenarios and is not economically viable under the given conditions. The main revenue sources are hydrogen sales and combined up-balancing and down-balancing services in electricity markets. Participation in the balancing market constitutes a significant portion (35 to 61%) of the total revenue in all cases with positive net profits, making it critical for economic viability. Rainwater is identified as the most cost-effective water source for hydrogen production. However, the costs associated with water treatment and brine management are minimal, contributing only 0.7 to 3.7% to the total cost of hydrogen production. Thus, differences in net profit are primarily attributed to the type of electrolysis technology used.";"2024-10-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624029500";"1";"Water Refinement"

This study used Vallisneria natans, Iris pseudacorus, and their mixed plantings in aquatic ecosystems (9 m × 2 m × 0.5 m, L × W × D) receiving increased eutrophic nitrogen and phosphorus gradients (4, 40, 80 mg/L of nitrogen and 0.4, 4, 8 mg/L of phosphorus), to unveil phytoremediation effects and corresponding microbial mechanisms. Different phytoremediations could effectively improve water quality with removal efficiencies of 57.4%–98.7% on ammonium, 45.7%–93.7% on total nitrogen, 46.7%–100% on available phosphorus, and 38.4%–95.2% on total phosphorus, respectively. Macrophytes and eutrophic gradients jointly affected diversities, compositions, structures, interactions, and functions of sedimental bacterial and archaeal communities. Microbial diversities increased with macrophytes presence and increased eutrophic gradients. Principal component analysis demonstrated that different macrophytes diverged microbial community structures, and increment of eutrophic gradients reduced structural dissimilarities. Dominant compositional communities, including Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Anaerolineae, and Nitrososphaeria, were also keystone taxa of community co-occurrence networks in phytoremediations. Increased eutrophic gradients enhanced microbial cooperative interactions, whilst V. natans fostered bacterial interactions, and I. pseudacorus and mixed plantings strengthened archaeal interactions. Functional prediction indicated that bacterial “phosphate transferase” and archaeal “methanogenesis” were significantly reduced, whilst archaeal “nitrification”, “denitrification”, “comammox”, and “methane oxidation” were elevated by macrophytes and eutrophic gradients, indicating likely mechanisms for nutrient and GHGs metabolisms. This study extended our knowledge on microbial mechanisms of phytoremediations with different macrophytes treating eutrophicated waters of increased gradients, therefore providing references for further developing phytoremediation technologies.

Common concentrations in wastewater can range from micrograms to milligrams per liter, which is concerning due to their persistence and potential health impacts. The sustainable approach of using a nonconventional, eco-friendly mineral-organic composite might address this environmental issue. This study focuses on utilizing a composite of bentonite (BEN) and lignite (LIG) as a sorbent for dyes: Rhodamine b (RB), Remazol brilliant blue r (RBBR), pharmaceuticals: ibuprofen (IB), sulfamethoxazole (STX), and surfactant: sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS) from both synthetic solutions and real wastewater. BEN was chosen for its high cation exchange capacity, while LIG was selected for its ability to adsorb both anionic and cationic formsdiverse functional groups. The composite with BEN to LIG ratio of 20:80 (BL 20:80) demonstrated superior sorption capacity. The adsorption performance is quantified, showing removal efficiencies of up to 18.9 mg RBBR/g, 22.8 mg RB/g, 1.77 mg IB/g, 1.47 mg STX/g, and 4.7 mg SDBS/g. Sorption efficiency is influenced by factors such as the initial sorbate concentration, the pH of the solution, the form of sorbates, and the adsorbents textural, physicochemical (point of zero charge pHZPC), ion-exchange capacity, hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity) properties. Generally, STX and RB is favored by slightly acidic conditions (pH 4–7), while RBBR and IB are favored by alkaline conditions (pH > 7). The complex physical sorption mechanism includes hydrogen bonding, electrostatic and dispersion forces, as well as π-π interactions. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) suggests that a significant portion of the hydrogen bonding interactions contributes to RB adsorption. The sorption results indicate that the specially-designed mineral composite can effectively remove various chemically distinct organic compounds from real wastewater. Subsequent investigations will focus on the granulated BL 20:80 composite and its applicability in dynamic column systems.

They play particularly important roles in the spread of non-point source pollution. However, previous research has not investigated their combined effects, especially in the topographically and ecologically volatile Loess Plateau, China. This study applied machine learning and positive matrix factorization techniques to water quality monitoring data for the Wuding River basin, China, from 2017 to 2021 to assess the seasonal impacts of environmental factors on river water quality. The results showed that there were spatial and seasonal variations in pollution sources, and specific thresholds for the key landscape indices that influence water quality were identified. Landscape composition and configuration have the greatest influence on the water quality parameters during the dry season, whereas connectivity and landscape configuration are more critical during the wet season. The connectivity contributions to chemical oxygen demand, the potassium permanganate index, and total phosphorus in the wet season were 19.07%, 27.47%, and 5.08% greater than in the dry season, respectively. Connectivity also made a significant contribution to the composite water quality index, accounting for 33.46% in the dry season and 36.22% in the wet season. The positive matrix factorization model identified agricultural non-point sources and mixed pollutants as the main factors affecting water quality during the dry season, whereas erosion and mixed pollution sources dominated the wet season. Critical thresholds were established for the landscape indices that affected water quality, such as a landscape shape index below 18.5 and a grassland proportion above 65%. The results can be used to develop more effective water quality management strategies and illustrate the essential role played by connectivity when tailoring water quality management strategies to seasonal variations.

As anthropogenic activities and climatic change intensify, they affect ES individually and interactively. Thus, clarifying the effects of anthropogenic activities and climatic change on ES, and grading them to improve them, is beneficial for improving the ecological resilience and sustainable development of the region. However, few studies focus on the effects of climate-anthropogenic interactions on ES. According to data from 130 cities in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB), this study constructs index systems of ES, anthropogenic activities and climate change. And response surface methodology (RSM) is utilized to analyze the effects of factors acting alone and interacting on ES, as well as the ecological improvement paths under different climatic condition. The results manifest that: (1) From years 2001–2021, the ES of the YREB fluctuates in time, increasing by 2.2%, due to declining biological abundance and water network density. Spatially, it displays a spatial distribution of “high in the north and low in the south.” In 2021, the percentages of cities in the YREB with relatively high and high sensitivity reach nearly 50%. (2) Among the climatic and anthropogenic factors, the proportions of cities where urbanization, advanced industrial structure, precipitation and temperature factors individually significantly affected ES is 67.7%, 63.1%, 56.2% and 54.6%, respectively, suggesting that all these factors have a significant impact on ES in most of the YREB. The proportion of negative interaction effects in the significant interaction between anthropogenic and climatic factors is 78.6%, indicating that most of the climatic factors have an inverse role in the anthropogenic effect on ES. (3) Improvement paths for areas with high sensitivity (27 cities) are found by RSM. A total of 24 cities can reduce ES by harmonizing anthropogenic factors under different climatic conditions. Meanwhile, 17 cities should take targeted measures in the light of climate change.

As science and technology have advanced, the use of artificial intelligence has penetrated various disciplines, and the application of machine learning has achieved many good results in the environmental sciences; however, little attention has been given to the WECC. To this end, a WECC assessment model was developed based on a variety of machine learning algorithms, to provide a novel approach and better understanding of the WECC. In this study, 13 natural and anthropogenic factors related to the water environment system in Liaoning Province (China) were selected, and the study period ranged from 2015 to 2019. Four basic machine learning algorithms, namely, random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and k-nearest neighbour (KNN), were used for batch modelling, and stacking was carried out based on the output results. A comparison and screening of the models revealed that RF and the stacking model had the best model prediction performances. Because RF was relatively simple and convenient, a comprehensive assessment of the regional WECC based on this algorithm was carried out. The results showed that most of the control units with an overloaded WECC are located in the central and northern regions of Liaoning Province, and the control units of overloading can be well identified and the trend of regional WECC status can be observed. To improve model transparency, we also performed an explanatory analysis based on the shapley additive explanations (SHAP). The results showed that precipitation, soil texture, sewage treatment plant, wind speed, and temperature were the most important factors influencing the water environment system. Precipitation is the most influential factor, and with increasing rainfall, the WECC first improves and then gradually deteriorates. For the anthropogenic factors, the WECC generally improves first and then worsens as these factors increase. These research results can be used to provide a powerful and practical new methodology for the comprehensive assessment of the WECC and provide a basis for the development of water environment policies and regulatory implementation in the region.

However, its effectiveness and mechanism as an amendment material to manage sediment internal phosphorus (P) release under anoxic conditions is still unclear. Thus, a lanthanum carbonate-modified shrimp shell biochar (LBC-1) was synthesized for controlling sediment P release, and the efficacy, mechanism, and sediment microbial community impact of LBC-1 under two application modes (addition and capping) were investigated. The maximum adsorption capacity of LBC-1 for phosphate was 79.5 mg/g, superior to most La-modified biochar materials. The generation of LaPO4 and Ca5(PO4)3(OH) precipitates and the formation of inner-sphere complexes were the main adsorption mechanisms of LBC-1 for phosphate. Both the LBC-1 addition and capping treatments successfully blocked sediment P release under anoxic conditions, with the removal efficiencies of DGT-labile P in the overlying water being 97.7–99.7% and 97.5–99.5%, respectively. The conversion of the mobile P forms to the stable HCl-P form in sediments played an important role in the interception of internal P release by the LBC-1 addition treatment. Furthermore, the LBC-1 addition treatment also prevented internal P release by effectively adsorbing DGT-labile P in the interstitial water due to the excellent P adsorption capacity of LBC-1. However, the prevention of P release from sediments by the LBC-1 capping treatment was mainly attributed to the efficient adsorption of DGT-labile P by LBC-1 at the sediment/overlying water interface. The release of P driven by sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) was a key mechanism for the migration of P from sediment to interstitial water. The LBC-1 addition treatment reduced the relative abundance of SRB in the surface sediment and might inhibit the release of sediment P into the interstitial water, whereas the LBC-1 capping treatment had little effect on the relative abundance of SRB.

This study investigated the performance and mechanism of a novel Fe(II)-mediated anaerobic ammonia oxidation (anammox) process characterized by stable nitrogen removal and production of high-value Fe–P crystals (FePs) as byproducts. Fe(II) promotes the synthesis of heme C and enhances the activity of nitrate reduction metabolic genes, which induce nitrate-dependent ferrous oxidation to form a complex Fe–N cycle. In addition, Fe(II) significantly enhanced the phosphorus removal efficiency up to 79.2 ± 6.9% by inducing Fe–P biomineralization. Biomolecular analysis has shown that most iron absorption and transport genes, as well as phosphate transport and regulation genes, are promoted by Fe(II). The composition and microstructure analyses of the anammox granules revealed the formation of FePs that consisted of phosphosiderite (FePO4·2H2O), ludlamite (Fe3(PO4)2·4H2O), and vivianite (Fe3(PO4)2∙8H2O). This study also provides an in-depth illustration of the structural characteristics and formation processes of anammox-FePs granules. Thus, an Fe(II)-induced Fe–N–P metabolic network in an anammox-dominated system was uncovered, offering a feasible approach for simultaneous nitrogen removal and phosphorus recovery.

However, rainwater is a potential source of water for various end uses of municipal water. In this context, permeable pavements are promising for mitigating floods and alleviating water stress in cities. Herein, a process-based life-cycle inventory modeling approach was used to quantify the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) and water footprints of different road pavements in 28 pilot sponge cities in China. Three asphalt pavements were considered in this study: permeable-surface, permeable-base, and conventional nonpermeable pavements. Moreover, life-cycle cost analyses were performed to reveal the cost-effectiveness of these pavements. Results showed that permeable-base pavements exhibited the highest levelized GHG emissions (5.9 kg CO2e/m2/yr), followed by nonpermeable (5.5 kg CO2e/m2/yr) and permeable-surface pavements (3.8 kg CO2e/m2/yr). In terms of levelized water footprint, permeable-base and permeable-surface pavements enabled water savings (433.8 and 304.1 kg/m2/yr, respectively), while nonpermeable pavements consumed 30.6 kg/m2/yr of water. The levelized life-cycle costs of permeable-surface, permeable-base, and nonpermeable pavements were 32.8, 35.4, and 40.5 yuan/m2/yr, respectively. With regard to transitioning from nonpermeable to permeable pavements in urban road construction, Chongqing and Shenzhen presented favorable potential for GHG mitigation (22 and 26 kt CO2e/yr, respectively) and water savings (196 and 187 Mt/yr, respectively). Contrarily, Hebi, Yuxi, Sanya, Qianan, Chizhou, and Xining were not cost-effective in terms of GHG emission reduction. Moreover, in this study, GHG–water–cost tradeoffs were identified among different pavements, highlighting directions for unlocking the green benefits of installing permeable asphalt pavements in China.

The hydroponic bed was configured on a bench with a capacity of 100 L (1.62 m-long, 0.72 m-width, and 0.1 m-depth) and was coupled to a plastic tank with the fish. The coriander seeds were irrigated for four days until germination, when they were transferred to the hydroponic beds. Two hundred forty tambaqui juveniles (113.5 ± 0.15 g and 19.6 ± 0.20 cm) were distributed in 12 tanks (1000-L capacity) in aquaponic units, totaling 20 fish per unit. The fish were fed commercial feed (36% protein and 7% lipids), and water quality variables were monitored daily. At 5, 10, and 15 days after transplanting to the hydroponic bed, the leaf number (LN) and plant height (PH, in cm) of the coriander were determined. Additionally, total fresh mass (TFM, in g), leaf fresh mass (LFM, in g), root fresh mass (RFM, in g), total dry mass (TDM, in g), leaf dry mass (LDM, in g), root dry mass (RDM, in g), leaf length (LL, in cm), root length (RL, in cm), yield of total fresh mass (YTFM, in kg m−2), and the nutritional composition of macro and micronutrients were determined, as well as fish growth performance. A density of 512 cells m−2 reduced the electrical conductivity (0.097 ± 0.001 dS m−1) of the water. The pH, dissolved oxygen, and temperature did not differ significantly between the densities. The total ammonia nitrogen (28.81 ± 2.26 mg L−1) and nitrate (51.07 ± 0.81 mg L−1) concentrations were greater at a density of 32 cells m−2.

All variables (PH with root, LL, RL, LFM, TFM, LDM, TDM, RFM, RDM, and YTFM) were significantly influenced (p < 0.05) as a function of cultivation density. YTFM (1.82 ± 0.45 kg m−2), PH (30.39 ± 0.61 cm), and LL (16.62 ± 0.53 cm) were significantly higher (p < 0.05) at a density of 512 cells m−2. RL was significantly higher (p < 0.05) at densities of 72 and 32 cells m−2, of the order of 15.98 ± 0.43 and 18.79 ± 1.01 cm, respectively. Boron was significantly greater at a density of 512 cells m−2 (39.70 ± 1.04 mg kg−1) than at 32 cells m−2 (29.93 ± 4.66 mg kg−1).

In this study, a novel positive charged buoyant cenosphere (FABC@CTS) was developed for capturing and floating algal cells using chitosan (CTS) and an easily available waste material—fly ash buoyant cenospheres (FABC). The prepared cell-capturing buoyant cenospheres were characterized by various analytical techniques and tested for the removal of Microcystosa aeruginosa. The results demonstrated that at a FABC-to-CTS mass ratio of 8:1 and an FABC@CTS dosage of 55.5 mg CTS/g algae, the removal efficiency of Microcystis aeruginosa exceeded 95%. XDLVO analysis indicated a significant reduction in the repulsive energy barrier after surface modification due to stronger electrostatic and van der Waals forces. Compared with 108 μm buoyant cenospheres, 50 μm FABC@CTS exhibited higher affinity to algal cells, significantly improved the compactness and floatability of aggregates, enabling the rapid flotation of microalgae in 1 min. The FTIR and XPS analysis results further revealed that the amino and hydroxyl functional groups on the surface of the FABC@CTS could effectively capture microalgae through hydrogen bonding and π–π bonding.

Peak hourly demands generate significant costs due to the energy requirements of producing and pumping large volumes of potable water. High peak demands also require large investments in infrastructure expansion to support urban growth and economic development. This research develops an agent-based model to assess a demand-side management strategy that shifts high hourly demands. This research envisions a gamification system that rewards players through a leaderboard for shifting water end uses for laundry, irrigation, and bathing from on-peak to off-peak periods. Gamification of demand shifting behaviors is enabled through advanced metering infrastructure, which measures hourly or sub-hourly demands at the account level, and can be analyzed to assess water use behaviors. This research develops an Agent-based Modeling approach based on the Opinion Dynamics theory to calculate the changing opinion of household agents toward shifting water demands, based on utility broadcasts, observations of neighbor water use, social media, and participation in a leaderboard. The model is applied for eight months of hourly demand data collected through smart meters at a participating utility. Results show that a high level of participation in the leaderboard increases the adoption rate of customers shifting the time of specific end uses and may account for up to a 37 % reduction of the peak volume. The diurnal curve is flattened as consumers shift water use from on-peak to off-peak hours.

A three-chamber MEC system was developed, where ammonia nitrogen from sewage migrated across the membrane to the cathode chamber, and bicarbonate from the absorption chamber was simultaneously captured at the cathode driven by alkalinity gradients. The NH3 and CO2 released from the carbon-nitrogen co-absorption solution upon heating were fixed by CaCl2 slag to produce nitrogen fertilizer and nanometer CaCO3 products.

Density functional theory (DFT), solubility, and UV spectrum analyses revealed that the high chemical potential of the (BX)2M, (DDA)2M complexes in lead-zinc flotation wastewater played key roles for the solubility and ECIME removal of these pollutants. The complexes significantly inhibited activated carbon (AC) interface adsorption, as well as DDA and (DDA)2M degradation and Fe(II)–Fe(III)–OH flocculation. Prolonging the treatment times for Pb2+, Zn2+, BX, and (BX)2M effectively alleviated the inhibitory effect. However, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis also highlighted the difficulty of the electrochemical reduction deposition of the Pb2+ and Zn2+ reactions. Comparatively, the DDA and (DDA)2M in composite systems showed higher electrochemical stability, while degradation was highly dependent on high voltage and exhibited temporal hysteresis in the ECIME system. The DDA removal rate only reached 60% after ECIME treatment at 45 V for 90 min, while the values of Pb2+ and Zn2+ (9 V, 30 min) and BX (18 V, 70 min) exceeded 90% and exhibited significantly disadvantage effect when voltage was larger than 18 V.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2024.143025";"A chemical-free magnetophoretic approach for recovering magnetic particles in microalgae removal through magnetic separation ";" Magnetic separation can swiftly remove many substances (e.g., biomolecules, cells, and viruses) from water. In algal bloom mitigation and biomass dehydration, magnetic particles (MPs) with proper surface modifications could effectively attract and remove algae from the impaired water body. It has long been expected to recover and reuse magnetic nanoparticles or particles to reduce the algal removal cost and potential adverse effects on the environment. This study evaluated the use of a tunable magnetic field to remove algae using functionalized MPs coated with polymers: polyethyleneimine (PEI), chitosan (CTS), and cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), whose recovery and reuse were examined. The results show that PEI-coated MPs and CTS-coated MPs at the coating density of 2.3 g-cationic polymers·g-MPs−1 achieved higher removal efficiencies of 88.61 ± 9.12% and 73.19 ± 0.37%, respectively, toward a model algal cell (i.e., Scenedesmus obliquus) within a 5-min separation time. In contrast, CTAB-coated MPs and pristine MPs exhibited lower removal efficiencies (47.46 ± 0.3% and 52.69 ± 0.44%, respectively). Furthermore, the removal efficiency of PEI-coated MPs was further improved to over 95% under pH 7, the highest magnetic field of 40 mT, and algogenic organic matter-free conditions. Adsorption kinetics and isotherm analysis revealed that chemical and physical interactions drive the adsorption of a monolayer of algal cells on the surface of magnetic particles. Atomic force microscopy and quartz crystal microbalance confirmed a strong adhesion force and rate between functionalized MPs and algae, which affect both algal removal efficiency and MPs recovery from algae-MPs aggregates. The extended Derjaguin−Landau−Verwey−Overbeek (EDLVO) theory predicted a strong attractive force between algae and cationic polymer-coated MPs, which supported the enhanced algal removal. Finally, almost 99% of the four MPs could be recovered from separated algae-MPs aggregates within 30 s under the strong magnetic field and exhibited excellent magnetic responsiveness and reusability in further separation cycles. This study establishes a foundation for coagulant-free algae removal and enables the potential sustainable separation processes.

Methodologically, the study utilizes the forward and backward propagation capabilities of BBNs in GeNIe software to identify critical indicators. It also examines the predictive power of these indicators by analyzing their mutual value of information in Hugin software. Data utilized in the analysis include GFSI data for 2022 and associated sustainability and adaptation indicators. Key findings reveal the critical importance of proactive risk management strategies, sustainable agricultural practices, and effective governance mechanisms in shaping food security outcomes. Disparities between high- and low-performing countries in GFSI outcomes underscore the need for tailored interventions to address systemic vulnerabilities. High-performing countries in the food security environment exhibit a very high probability of 93% of achieving high performance in the national agricultural adaptation policy. Conversely, low-performing countries exhibit a very high probability of 91% of achieving low performance in the agricultural water risk – quality indicator. The study contributes theoretically by uncovering the complex interactions within food systems and practically by offering insights for policymakers and practitioners to develop targeted interventions.

Biosolids are valuable resources due to their high concentrations of carbon and other components. In line with Circular Economy principles, this study explores the potential conversion of biosolids into value-added products, specifically focusing on the feasibility of producing microstructure-engineered powdered activated carbon (AC) for wastewater treatment. Carbonization of biosolids using microwave (MW)-assisted heating technology, compared to traditional heating, presented reduced energy consumption (by 26%) and 38% higher surface area while attaining a similar carbonization yield. After the activation step, MW technology led to a 16% enhancement in surface area, achieving 1507 ± 60 m2/g. Subsequent diluted acid washing effectively reduced the ash content from 58 ± 2.3 to 14.4 ± 1.2 wt%. Then, the microstructure of the AC was tailored to adsorb methylene blue (MB, as a model molecule) and humic acid (HA, as a complex natural organic matter). Microstructure modifications attained an optimal blend of micro- and mesopores for adsorption. One of the ACs was assessed for methylene blue (MB) adsorption, demonstrating a remarkable adsorption capacity of 759 ± 46 mg/g, surpassing a commercial standard sample by 41.5%. The second AC displayed an adsorption capacity of 126.6 ± 5.1 g/mg of HA, a 22% improvement over the commercial sample with an adsorption capacity of 103.5 ± 4.1 mg/g. Kinetics analysis of both adsorption tests was conducted, and they fit well with the pseudo-second-order model.

This study develops and tests a novel life cycle assessment (LCA)-based framework to examine strategies for produced water (PW) management from offshore oilfield operations. The framework encompasses experimental designs under a dynamic modelling system coupled with stepwise linear regression, multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), and fluctuating scenarios in Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) and other internal reuse options including cooling systems, drilling operations, and utility services. Two strategies for treatment train technologies were tested with various PW compositions, sludge management options, and variable EOR demands. When comparing conventional (corrugated plate interceptor, hydrocylone and nutshell filter) with recent treatment/disposal technologies (tubular separation, combined fiber coalescence and mechanical vapor compression), the LCA revealed that the latter increased operational efficiency (14%), reduced cost (6.5%) and the overall environmental impact categories (66%). The scenario that exhibited the lowest emissions incorporated recent treatment technologies and land application for sludge management. This configuration demonstrated considerable environmental advantages, evidenced by significant reductions in key impact indicators including freshwater eutrophication (74%), global warming (64%), marine ecotoxicity (58%), and stratospheric ozone depletion (44%) when compared to the baseline scenario with conventional treatment-disposal methods. The system dynamics model revealed that the internal reuse options exploited 23%–47% of PW inflow, indicating a significant annual surplus of unused PW that presents an opportunity for external applications to enhance sustainability. In closure, we argue that the proposed framework offers a valuable tool for waste management practitioners, facilitating the identification and selection of strategies with minimal environmental impacts for PW management.

In this study, a hybrid anomaly detection framework is developed by the combination of prediction-based and classification-based data-driven methods to provide a scientific indication for river pollution identification. A Variational Mode Decomposition-Back Propagation Neural Network (VMD-BPNN) model is used to analyze the real-time water quality variation tendencies in the first stage. Additionally, a Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) algorithm is adopted to capture the multi-dimensional water quality anomaly characteristics in the second stage. The developed hybrid framework is then applied to the Kansas River in America, to verify its river pollution identification performance in comparison to different anomaly detection methods and in various anomaly-level scenarios.

Activated peroxymonosulfate (PMS) method is often used for catalytic degradation of antibiotics. However, how to reduce catalyst cost and ensure efficient degradation of antibiotics at the same time is a sticky issue for the activated PMS method. Two-dimensional vermiculite flakes (2D-VMT) is cost-effective and can be used as catalyst carriers for PMS activation. Hence, we exfoliated 2D-VMT from natural vermiculite and prepared NiCo2O4 loaded 2D-VMT (NiCo2O4/2D-VMT) catalyst. Levofloxacin (LVX), as a normal antibiotic, was used to evaluate the catalytic capacity of NiCo2O4/2D-VMT in PMS systems. Also, LVX degradation mechanism through NiCo2O4/2D-VMT activated PMS were explored here. XRD, EDS, TEM, and HRTEM analysis all demonstrated NiCo2O4 nanoparticles were successfully anchored on 2D-VMT. NiCo2O4/2D-VMT had a high specific surface area and abundant active sites. The NiCo2O4/2D-VMT/PMS system, with a 15% mass ratio of NiCo2O4 to 2D-VMT (15%-CN/2D-VMT), achieved LVX removal efficiency of 87% and LVX removal rate of 0.034 min−1. 1O2 and SO4·- were the major ROS for LVX degradation. The reversible redox cycle between Co(III)/Co(II) and Ni(III)/Ni(II) played a crucial role in activating PMS to generate ROS for LVX degradation process. Also, based on intermediates identification by LC-MS, possible degradation pathways of LVX were proposed and their ecotoxicological evolution was assessed by using the ECOSAR software. 15%-CN/2D-VMT may be a worth recommended loaded catalyst for antibiotics removal in environmental remediation, owing to its high reusability and excellent renewability.

The success of reuse practices mainly depends on the triad technology, regulation, and public acceptance. This study investigated public acceptance as a technical parameter to assess the implementation feasibility of DPR in large cities of developing countries. Residents of Campinas City (São Paulo, Brazil) were consulted through a multiple-response questionnaire addressing sociodemographic aspects, personal environmental perceptions, and the acceptable uses for wastewater reuse. The results showed a low rejection rate (∼7%) to DPR despite this not being regulated in Brazil. A total of 47% of the volunteers declared that they would accept the DPR of domestic sewage after appropriate treatments and technologies approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), and 46% would accept it after more information. Age was an essential factor for DPR acceptance, being greater among those between 30 and 45 years old.

The degradation rate of SMX by BNSBC/PMS system could reach 92.1% within 60 min ([SMX]0 = 10 mg/L, [BNSBC]0 = 0.4 g/L, [PMS]0 = 1 mM). B and N exhibited the synergistic enhancement effects on the physico-chemical characteristics of SBC, and abundant pores, defects, CO, -O-B-O-, graphitic-N and pyridinic N were confirmed as the main active sites of BNSBC for PMS activation. Characterization, quenching, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and electrochemical tests proved that non-radicals of surface-bound, 1O2 and electron transfer were the main contributors to SMX degradation. The high anti-interference of BNSBC/PMS system to pH range, co-existing inorganic anions and organic matter guaranteed its outstanding purification performance for SMX in diverse environmental waters.

The modelling results demonstrated that high filter porosity and low hydraulic load were significant factors for optimal removal of NH4–N, Total-N, PO4–P, Total- P in the top layer (>99.95 ± 0.03 %, 44.37 ± 28.75%, 70.89 ± 28.30%, 76.18 ± 20.3%), middle layer (>98.94 ± 1.77%, 18.23 ± 23.04%, 76.62 ± 28.73%, 65.40 ± 31.85%) and deep layer (>99.99 ± 0.02%, 65.50 ± 20.64%, 75.53 ± 23.16%, 41.54 ± 28.81%) in the TFCW system, respectively.

Here, this work proposes a sponge-like double-network hydrogel composite hygroscopic agent with a layered porous structure formed by mechanical foaming and in situ polymerization. The internal polymer skeleton can not only effectively prevent moisture-absorbing salt particles from aggregating and leaking, but also has stable mechanical properties. The layered porous structure and excellent superhydrophilicity enable the hydrogel hygroscopic agent to achieve excellent water absorption performance (0.785–3.507 g g−1) over a wide range of humidity (30 %–90 %). Thanks to the excellent photothermal performance, the hydrogel hygroscopic agent achieves a desorption efficiency of 3.82 kg m−2 h−1 under one sun. This high-performance, low-cost, and stable sponge hydrogel has great potential for large-scale atmospheric water harvesting applications, providing ideas for future multifunctional moisture-absorbing gels.

Herein, we proposed an effective strategy to construct multi-functional MoS2/rGO piezocatalysts based on bacteria-catalyst topological interactions and electron pump effects, which possessed high carrier separation ability and adhesion to bacteria, ensuring the effective utilization of ROS. Attributed to the unique 3D heterogeneous structure and interface electronic structure, MoS2/rGO could completely inactivate 6.21 log10 cfu mL−1 of E. coli K-12 within 30 min under ultrasonic conditions, significantly faster than pure MoS2. It was demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that the introduction of rGO led to the generation of a large amount of ROS by enhancing the piezoelectric properties and conductivity of MoS2/rGO, while the topological interactions between MoS2/rGO and bacteria facilitated effective bacteria capture, improving the utilization of ROS. Additionally, Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy texting confirmed that rGO acts as an electron pump, effectively attracting electrons from bacterial cells, which disrupted bacterial metabolic processes, increased oxidative stress, and further enhanced the bactericidal effect. The mechanisms of topological interactions and electron pump effects elucidated in this work offer new insights into the design and understanding of efficient bactericidal materials in water purification applications.

In this study, an emerging and effective method was used to purify PCE contaminated water by activating persulfate (PS) with dithionite (DTN). The addition ratio of PS and DTN were optimized in the removal of PCE by PS-DTN system and the optimal molar ratio of PS to DTN was 1 to 1 at the maximum PCE removal rate, and it was applicable in the pH range of 3–12. In PCE simulated wastewater, PCE removal rate in PS-DTN system exceeded 90% within 48 h, which was 66% higher than that in PS-NaOH system, and the degradation process followed pseudo-first-order kinetics with the reaction rate constant being 0.068 h−1. The dominant active species in PS-DTN system was proved to be sulfate radical on PCE degradation based on the radical quenching experiments and ESR analysis. HCO3 − and low concentration of natural organic matter (NOM) could promote the removal of PCE, while Cl− and high NOM concentration had no adverse effect on PCE degradation. Few chlorinated intermediates (<2.77%) were produced and the dechlorination rate of PCE reached 95%, indicating a low secondary pollution risk. In simulated groundwater containing aquifer media, PS-DTN system could still degrade PCE to a certain extent, but the non-target reaction triggered by iron minerals on the medium mainly inhibited PCE degradation. The study showed that PS-DTN system was promising in degrading organic pollutants in groundwater.

Seawater collected from “Bay of Bengal” was used as the fluid and analysis was conducted at a constant water depth of 20 mm. The system was constructed using mild steel and stainless steel 316 L was used as electrodes. A set voltage and current of 12 V and 40 A was supplied to the electrodes through switched-mode power supply (SMPS). The study investigated the impact of solar radiation and induction of electrolysis system on the performance of solar stills. The results demonstrate a significant positive correlation between solar radiation and still temperature, with 877.1 W/m2 of maximum solar radiation intensity resulting in a still temperature of 53.9 °C. The temperature of the basin water increased by an average of 4.25% upon the addition of an electrolyser. It was noted that with the introduction of electrolyser there was increase in productivity by 48 % than the still without the electrolyser. When the solar radiation was at its peak the maximum amount of hydrogen and oxygen were produced which is 0.44 kg/L and 0.24 kg/L respectively. It was noted that when the system with electrolyser is operated at its peak there was increase in solar still and exergy efficiency by 30.5 % and 9.32 % than the system operated without electrolyser. The economic analysis revealed that the hybrid system which possessed electrolyser has very short pay back period of 1.5 days which is approximately 90 days less than the still without electrolyser. The study shows the use of hybrid system reduces the carbon emission significantly which contributes for its sustainable utilisation. The study highlights the interaction between solar radiation, electrolyser induction, and overall efficiency in the context of seawater desalination and shows the system's strong performance.

Herein, we designed Mg-assembled carbonitride (MAC) that allowed for phosphorus (P) and selective dye recovery (methylene blue (MB) as model pollutants) simultaneously, and then successfully separated the two pollutants in a simple way to obtain pure dyes and phosphorus-containing compounds. The triazine ring conjugation framework and abundant functional groups of carbonitride facilitated the doping of Mg sites. The adsorption capacity of MAC for P (211.6 ± 2 vs 207.4 mg P·g−1) and MB (116.5 ± 3 vs 117.8 mg MB·g−1) in the binary-polluted system exhibited little difference from the individual, implying synchronous and undiminished adsorption on MAC. This was attributed to the ring-opening reaction triggered by NaOH etching and thermal decomposition, generating the two new active sites, where cyano groups (C N) interacted with P and Mg–N bonds responded with both target pollutants. Moreover, the favorable selective adsorption ability of MAC for different dyes was attributed to electrostatic attraction, surface complexation, hydrogen bonds and π-π interactions.

H3PO4 was used as the precipitant for F removal. The F concentration could be reduced from 9.5 mg/L to 0.09–0.91 mg/L for over 900 BV with running-backwashing cycle. The precipitates formed during contact precipitation were easily stripped from the shell matrix by periodic backwashing, thus supporting the continuous dissolution of calcium (Ca) from the shell particles. X-ray diffraction (XRD)-Rietveld analysis showed that the backwashing residue was fluorapatite (FAP) with a small amount of hydroxy substitution. Therefore, FAP can be used as a raw material in phosphate fertilizer manufacturing. Economic analysis and sustainability evaluation showed that the contact precipitation process with H. cumingii shells as the substrate not only reduces chemical costs but also generates value-added products; thus, this process is environmentally friendly compared to traditional methods of F removal. The proposed approach for F elimination, waste shell utilization, and F and Ca resource recovery in the contact precipitation process represents a novel sustainable water treatment technology.

The pharmaceuticals were adsorbed on biochar prepared from Miscanthus x giganteus biomass obtained from the phytoremediation of contaminated or marginal soil. The feedstock was pyrolyzed at 360 °C (M-3) and 500 °C (M-5). The representation of functional groups, specific surface area, porosity, and pore volume were lower for M-5. Pore diameters were comparable, but their depth decreased for M-5. The specific surface area and porosity surface area of M-5 were 30 times higher after 4 h of shaking compared to properties without shaking. The biochar leachate pH was 9.8 ± 1.0 (M-3), and 11.1 ± 1.1 (M-5). No desorption of potentially risk organic compounds was detected. M-3 was generally a better adsorption material. The removal of EE2, AT and SMX was greater than 90%, 70% and 30 % respectively after 4 h in model waters. There was no evidence of a linear relationship between the sorption efficiency of pharmaceuticals and the biochar dose. Sorption experiments with real wastewater from a hospital wastewater treatment plant demonstrated high removal rates of monitored pharmaceuticals, including e.g. SMX (80%), trimethoprim (91%), venlafaxine (100%), clarithromycin (96%), tramadol (93%), diclofenac (86%). It was proven that the efficiency of the adsorption process is influenced not only by the dose or physico-chemical properties of the biochar, but also by the initial concentration of the pharmaceutical and its properties. The presence of other components of real wastewater, which can cause competitive sorption and overlapping of active centers on the surface of the biochar, also decreased the efficiency. The results demonstrate that both biochars are suitable for tertiary or quaternary water treatment for pharmaceutical removal. Due to the lower energetic, and therefore economic, costs of pyrolysis, a lower pyrolysis temperature can be preferred.

Mitigating pollution in the way of sustainability is the need of the hour to protect the existing environment from degradation. In this regard, eco-friendly biochar was prepared from the intact plant of Eichhornia crassipes (water hyacinth) without neglecting the roots, stems, leaves, and flowers and assessed for its ammonium removal efficiency in the study. Twelve biochars of two categories, viz., treated and normal, were produced under two different pyrolysis temperatures of 300 °C and 500 °C and three residence times of 30, 45, and 60 min. The adsorption experiments were conducted as batch studies in triplicate to examine the impacts of multiple adsorption-inducing factors in biochar.

To this end, field studies including environmental surveying and water column sampling at six stations along two routes in Lake Zarivar, Iran, together with laboratory analysis were conducted. Then, a stepwise multivariate regression analysis was employed to identify existing patterns and effects among variables. To secure the evolved model generalizability, the range of data was adjusted using available measurements from several similar lakes/wetlands with respect to their climate and sampling season. Finally, the evolved models’ reliability was examined using validation samples as well as a comparative performance appraisal with a benchmark model attained by the least squares regression technique. The results indicated that NH4 and pH have the most significant effect on DO. The greater amount of DO on the lake surface, i.e., wind effect, and its effect on both nitrification and ammonification processes ensure the absence of hypoxia in surface layers. Therefore, in water column monitoring programs, measuring NH4 and pH would be sufficient. Our results also demonstrated that the potential of hypoxia increases if the amount of NH4 increases in the lower layers of the water column despite releasing DO with nitrate. Strong relations between DO, as the main factor of hypoxia, with NH4 and pH, gives us the opportunity to predict the hypoxia potential and its level.

Their harmfulness to the ecosystem cannot be ignored. UV/H2O2 is one of the most conventional advanced oxidation processes, which has remarkable advantages for the removal of refractory organic pollutants in wastewater. However, the reaction mechanisms and pathways of pollutants with reactive radicals are still unclear. In this study, the degradation efficacy and mechanisms during the photodegradation of 2,4-D and 4-CPA in UV/H2O2 processes were investigated by experiments and density functional theory calculations. The results showed that 2,4-D was more likely to be degraded by UV/H2O2 treatment than UV photolysis alone. In contrast, 4-CPA can be degraded effectively and rapidly under UV irradiation alone. By LC-MS analysis, the degradation products of 2,4-D and 4-CPA in the UV/H2O2 processes were identified and they were produced by hydroxylation and photolysis. Therefore, we speculated a competition mechanism presented between direct photolysis and indirect photolysis in the UV/H2O2 degradation of 2,4-D and 4-CPA. The OH-initiated reaction mechanisms of 2,4-D and 4-CPA in aqueous environments were investigated using quantum chemical methods SMD/M06–2X/6–311++G (3df, 2p)//SMD/M06–2X/6-311 + G (d,p). The pH dependence of the reaction mechanisms and rate constants in their degradation process induced by ·OH was also investigated. The calculation results showed that the ionic forms (2,4-D- and 4-CPA-) were more prone to react with ·OH in comparison to the corresponding molecular forms (2,4-D and 4-CPA). The total rate constants of 2,4-D and 4-CPA with OH increased with the pH from 1 to 10, and decreased with continued pH increase.

Finally, the factors influencing ecological compensation and the interactions among the factors were analyzed using an optimal parameters-based geographical detector.

In this study, the electron beam radiation coupled to flocculation process was firstly developed and investigated for the advanced treatment of coking and dyeing wastewater. Three different coupled processes were studied, i.e. electron beam radiation followed by flocculation process (EBF), flocculation followed by electron beam radiation process (FEB), and simultaneous electron beam radiation and flocculation process (SEBF). It was found that different processes had various performances in the removal of targeted organic pollutants. For humic acid, FEB with poly aluminum ferric chloride (PAFC) as flocculants showed the best synergistic effect at 10 kGy, in which the removal of humic acid was 95.2%, while SEBF exhibited the inhibition effect under all the conditions. For Rhodamine B, EBF with PAFC had the highest synergistic effect at 10 kGy, in which the removal of Rhodamine B was 87.4%. For phenol, SEBF with PAFC as flocculants showed the highest synergistic effect at 10 kGy, in which the phenol removal was 64.2%. The transformation of organic pollutants, such as the polymerization was the main reason for the synergistic effect of EBF, while the dissolved iron ions and the enhanced oxidation made major contribution to the synergistic effect of FEB, and the structural change of flocculants and the transformation of organic pollutants during the process of electron beam radiation was mainly responsible for the synergistic effect of SEBF. EBF showed better performance in COD removal for actual coking and dyeing wastewater than FEB, indicating that electron beam radiation could promote the flocculation effect. Considering the operation procedure and treatment cost comprehensively, EBF with PAFC is recommended for the advanced treatment of actual coking and dyeing wastewater. This study could provide a novel and effective method for the advanced treatment of industrial wastewater.

However, these factors are also polluting the existing water bodies and therefore, limiting the water supply. Increasing level of contaminants poses risk to human, wildlife and the environment. Widening gap between water demand and supply creates water stress. Therefore, treatment of waste water becomes imperative in order to ensure sustainable development of planet earth. Conventional methods utilizing physical, chemical and biological processes are generally adopted for this purpose. These methods are further modified so as to enhance the efficiency and economy of the treatment process as well as to make them more eco-friendly. None of the conventional or advance technology is individually sufficient for appropriate treatment of wastewater. Therefore, more efficient hybrid methods are required. The development of such hybrid methods needs detailed information about various treatment methods. This paper critically reviews the conventional and advanced biological methods used for waste water treatment. The main objective of this review is to present vital information about various biological treatment methods forming the basis for the development of sustainable hybrid methods for waste water treatment.

IS creates links between different industries to reduce resource consumption. This article analyses the environmental, social, and economic sustainability aspects of the WF in an IS system. First, the inventories of these three aspects were carried out simultaneously with the WF inventory. Sustainability indices were presented based on the relative comparison of current WF and sustainably oriented WF (SOWF). SOWF in an IS system is defined as the situation with minimum total WF and is obtained by mathematical programming. The proposed framework was applied to an IS involving three industries in southeastern Iran: steel production, coal concentrate, and power generation. The blue WFs of these industries were calculated as 11.77 m3/ton of steel, 0.87 m3/ton of coal, and 8.31 m3/MWh of power. The sustainability indices revealed that the steel industry exhibited a more favorable environmental and social performance than other industries, while the power generation was economically superior with a higher cost ratio of current WF to SOWF. Subsequently, several sustainability-enhancing solutions were evaluated based on environmental, economic, and social criteria. Among these, solar energy usage, wastewater reuse, and recycling in iron ore processing emerged as effective strategies to enhance overall sustainability by reducing WFs and improving social criteria. Ultimately, the wastewater reuse option was given the highest priority. ";"2024-05-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624016755";"1";"Water Refinement"

Due to the limited amount of in-situ temperature measurements from traditional sampling programmes, most of the related studies, however, restricted their analysis within the surface and rarely checked the results for whole depth profiles. Moreover, capability of such methods in projecting thermal dynamics under future climate conditions is even less illustrated. To fill the gap, we collected an unparalleled huge database including 9 million water temperature measurements, from 2013 to 2022, in Rappbode Reservoir, Germany as well as the corresponding climatic and hydrological observations, to train three commonly used ML models (Random Forest, XGBoost, and Long Short-Term Memory) and comprehensively evaluate their performance in reproducing thremal structure within the whole water column. We also systemically compared such simulation results with a well-established process-driven model (CE-QUAL-W2). Going beyond a pure reproduction of observatiosn, we further evaluated the ability of CE-QUAL-W2 and ML models in projecting thermal dynamics under RCP8.5 climate scenario up to 2100. Our results suggested three ML methods yielded high accuracy in capturing water temperature dynamics from the surface (epilimnion) to bottom (hypolimnion), and also satisfactorily reproduced temporal development of the stratification pattern, with the results corresponding well with those from CE-QUAL-W2. By contrast, the projections by ML models were rather insensitive to future climate warming under RCP8.5 comparing with those by CE-QUAL-W2, pointing to an important risk whenever ML-based models are extrapolated beyond their training data range. Supported by millions of in situ measurements, our research clearly illustrated the opportunities (limits) of ML models in projecting thermal dynamics in deep waters, and the conclusion also provides key guidance for scientists to select the appropriate tools in projecting water temperature, and other environmental factors, under changing climate.

Optimizing oxygen transfer, from an energy usage perspective, is crucial in the development of clean production techniques and for the stimulation of the circular economy. Although large efforts have been made in enhancing this process, particularly in ameliorating bubble diffusers, a main problem lies in energy wastage due to over-pursuing ultra-fine bubble generation. In this study, a dynamic model, that integrated both bubble expansion and detachment at submerged orifices, and consequential oxygen utilization during the uprising, was developed in order to better facilitate energy savings during the control of bubble generation. We demonstrate through calibrated models that bubble formation is governed by many factors including gas flow rate, orifice radius, surface tension, liquid viscosity, and surface wettability. Small bubbles are more prone to form when subjected to conditions of high wettability, small orifice size and low flow rate, since the bubbles are easily detached by the increasing upward forces in these scenarios. The oxygen transfer during the rising process was calculated as a function of bubble size, gas type and water depth. Bubbles with a radius smaller than a threshold value can shrink and collapse while below the water surface and thus provide 100% oxygen utilization. The threshold values of bubble radius are determined to be 150 μm and 250 μm at 5 m and 15 m initial water depth, respectively. The parameter set for bubble generation in order to obtain the desired bubble size may then be inversely determined by our bubble formation model, and it's considered as optimal aeration strategy to realize precise aeration. With these results, our study highlights the viability of the approach employing the proposed model in order to direct energy-efficient bubble generation.

The results show that short-term sustained heavy precipitation causes additional load on the river. Significant temporal variations and increases in dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and molecular weight of raw water were observed during the heavy precipitation, and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) showed a remarkably decline with the continuation of precipitation. The molecular weight and aromaticity of DOM increased dramatically with the continuous superposition of precipitation and flow, and the proportion of hydrophobic fraction increased during the study period. Four different fluorescent components were identified, including humic-like (C1, C2 and C3), and protein-like fluorophore C4. Heavy precipitation events affected the mobilization of DOM, while the generation of DBPs increased by 4%–47% during the chlorination, and the elevated river level further increased the DBPs formation. In particular, the HOA fraction was the main contributor of DBPs (up to 70%). The risk of haloacetic acids (HAAs) generation caused by heavy rainfall was concentrated in the river runoff producing and regression periods for both hydrophobic and hydrophilic fractions of DOM. Humification index (HIX) was positively correlated with the yield level of TCM, DCAA, TCAA, and DCAN during chlorination. Chlorination disinfection of raw water during river runoff producing and regression period is likely to increase the haloacetonitriles formation potential (HANsFP), thus posing a vital threat to water supply safety, while chloramination disinfection may significantly relieve the threat. This study provides a theoretical basis for the direct/indirect link between short-term precipitation events and their impact on water quality.

In this study, to explore the underlying mechanism of these dual factors on water quality in the upper Taihu Basin, a combination of graphical analysis, the water quality index (WQI) method, and the partial least square-structural equation model (PLS-SEM) were employed to quantitatively investigate the river structure indices (water surface ratio, WP; river system fractal, Δα; river network connectivity, γ) and hydrodynamic force indices (the flow index, FI), and their influence on water quality. Negative correlations were found between both WP and Δα with FI and a positive correlation between γ and FI. The southern water network had a higher water body area and greater difference in river network density, while the northern river network had enhanced connectivity and stronger water flow, thus exhibiting superior water quality. Regarding the influence of these factors on water quality, the impact of river structure on WQI was statistically insignificant (P > 0.05), while hydrodynamic force was significantly positively correlated with the WQI (P < 0.05). Moreover, in comparison to the path coefficient of 0.657 for the river structure's influence on the WQI, the hydrodynamic force exerted an even more significant impact on water quality with a path coefficient of 0.715. This study suggested that water quality improvements depend on optimizing the structural integrity of river systems and promoting favorable hydrodynamic conditions, with the latter having greater influence. This research provided theoretical underpinning for optimizing river structure and advancing river and lake water environments within the Taihu Basin.

The regulation of cake layer characteristics is less clarified in the coagulation-microfiltration (CMF) technique due to an incomplete understanding of flocculation mechanism; however, gaining such insight will contribute to improving MF efficiency for water purification. Herein, an antifouling MF membrane for high saline textile wastewater was constructed using polydopamine (pDA) co-deposition with sodium p-styrenesulfonate (SS), and methoxypolyethylene glycols (mPEG). Thereafter, the cake layer formation in the CMF technique could be precisely regulated by adjusting salt concentration (NaCl or Na2SO4). Results indicated that the inorganic salt-induced transformation of flocculation mechanism endows a desired regulation of cake layer characteristics, consequently leading an increase in membrane flux. Various properties and formation of flocs were caused via different flocculation mechanisms (from predominant charge neutralization to integrated interaction) in response to a salt variation, giving rise to a directed transition behavior of cake layer formation from compact to porous structure. Particularly, the coagulation mechanism was validated by the experimental analysis and molecular dynamics simulations. Furthermore, the high salt permeation (>90%) and acceptable dye rejection (>98%) of two commercial reactive dyes could be obtained by the proposed CMF technique, exhibiting a satisfactory fractionation behavior of dyes/inorganic salt. A beneficial contribution is the direct reuse dyeing of NaCl from the spent dyeing bath in new dyeing operations. These results could provide a further understanding of the underlying mechanisms of coagulation-enhancing MF behavior and inspire the precise regulation of cake layer characteristics to achieve efficient MF.

To guarantee the safety of water quality, the development of in-situ and online sensors for monitoring Cr(VI) contamination events is crucial. In this work, sediment microbial fuel cell (SMFC) based sensors using floating cathode as sensing element were operated in outdoor environment for one year to monitor repeated Cr(VI) shocks in wetlands constructed with coastal alkaline soil (YC), paddy of acidic soil (YT), and paddy of neutral soil (NJ). K2CrO4 solutions were added to the cathode four times in January, March, June, and September, respectively. Results showed that each Cr(VI) addition triggered a voltage peak and the voltage increments were linearly correlated with Cr(VI) concentrations within the range of 5–120 mg L−1 Cr(VI). The highest sensitivity was observed for YC (1.2 mV L mg−1) and YT (1.4 mV L mg−1) in June and for NJ (1.2 mV L mg−1) in September. XPS analysis demonstrated the reduction reaction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) on the cathode might contribute to the generation of voltage peaks. Despite repeated shocks, Cr(VI) was immobilized in the soil and completely reduced to low-toxic Cr(III) with the consumption of soil organic matter, and the diversity and abundance of exoelectrogenic bacteria-associated genera were not inhibited.

Effective biodegradation strategies are required for their removal and detoxification. In this study, bacterioplankton were isolated from eutrophic reservoir water used for crop irrigation and tested for their ability to degrade MCs. These bacteria are hydrologically transported from the contaminated reservoir to downstream farms where they are able to grow under the favorable conditions provided by a multi-soil-layering (MSL) system, a low-cost and locally applicable ecotechnology for the removal and detoxification of MCs. These bacteria enhance the ability of the MSL to remove MCs by forming biofilms within the MSL system. The bacterial strains were then sequenced and their partial 16S rRNA was compared to the reference strains in the NCBI database. The effectiveness of the MSL system in the removal of MCs from water was evaluated. The MSL utilizes a layered soil matrix that promotes microbial growth and physicochemical interactions that enable the removal of various contaminants. The mechanisms of MC removal in the MSL were evaluated by studying the physicochemical properties of the system substrate before and after treatment using X-ray fluorescence, zeta potential, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses. The microbial functional groups, including ammonifying and denitrifying bacteria, were also investigated in the MSL soil matrices before and after treatment. The results showed that seven bacterial strains exhibited high MC degradation capabilities, with MC degradation performance exceeding 97%. These isolated bacterial strains had a nucleotide identity score of 100% and an E value of 0.0 compared to reference strains. The MSL showed a 99% removal rate for MC-LR and MC-YR, as well as significant reductions in other pollutants, including COD (60%), BOD5 (60%), chlorophyll-a (96%), pheophytin (70%), organic nitrogen (80%), and nitrites (90%). After treatment, there was a statistically significant increase in the total bacterial count, as well as ammonifying and denitrifying bacteria, in the MSL soil matrices compared to their state before treatment. SEM analyses revealed the formation of dense biofilm microbiota, indicating additional biological processes besides adsorption for MC reduction. Overall, the MSL provides a low-cost alternative for the removal of MCs and cyanobacteria with minimal resource requirements and maintenance. It offers a promising solution for mitigating toxic cyanobacterial blooms, ensuring safe agricultural water reuse.

Effects of sludge concentration and FeCl3 dosage on carbon capture in FC-HRAS were investigated. The optimum sludge concentration of 2.0 g/L and FeCl3 dosage of 30 mg Fe/L were obtained, with total COD removal efficiency of 76.8%. Carbon balance analysis showed that FC-HRAS increased organics capture proportion by 91.8% while reducing loss from oxidative metabolism compared to HRAS. The potential mechanism of enhanced carbon capture for FC-HRAS was further explored. Adding Fe(III) caused coagulation of organics by increasing the Zeta potential in wastewater. Impacted by charge neutralization “compression” and coagulation floc “encirclement”, sludge particle sizes decreased, leading to increases of internal surface area and adsorption site of sludge for binding with bacteria; it facilitated the biological flocculation of FC-HRAS. Meanwhile, Fe(III) binding with proteins in EPS induced formation of “protein shell – β polysaccharides kernel” sludge structure and reduction of sludge negative charge, which intensified sludge stability and agglomeration. These factors explained the increase in organics capture proportion. The decrease in metabolism loss of organics could be attributed to the increase in organics transfer resistance in sludge EPS and selective elimination of heteromorphic bacteria (e.g., denitrifiers) in sludge.

Currently, struvite recovery often requires supplementing magnesium ions and raising pH with chemicals, making the recovered struvite unfavorable for organic production. In an effort for cleaner production, this study developed a versatile approach employing two mineral products in variable combinations for optimal supplementation of magnesium and elevation of pH. Magnesite, a mineral of MgCO3, was ground and calcined without use of any catalysts. The magnesite calcined under the optimum conditions (800 °C for 30 min) can be dissolved in near-neutral filtrate of sludge digestate to supplement magnesium and raise pH for effective struvite formation. The OMRI-listed Epsom salts (MgSO4∙7H2O), mineral-based water-soluble commercial products, can be used to supplement magnesium without changing pH of alkaline wastewater. Six-hour batch operation of an air-lift crystallizer removed 85.7% and 94.7% of phosphate in hydrolyzed human urine when magnesium was amended to 1.2 × molar concentration of phosphate with calcined magnesite and an OMRI-listed Epsom salt, respectively.

Year-round availability and biodegradable organic content of greywater make it a viable source of water for recycle and reuse supplementing water supply especially in water-stressed areas. Greywater reuse warrants installation of a treatment plant and supply infrastructure, both of which require financial resources. Unfortunately, there is no uniform method for performing cost-benefit analysis (CBA) that considers the local context but still is applicable to all reuse applications. The present work critically analyses the overall greywater characteristics and evaluates the efficacy of various physicochemical, biological, and advanced treatment methodologies for enhancing its quality, with the ultimate aim of promoting its safe and sustainable reuse. This article addresses several ways for CBA of greywater management and illustrates them with examples. Appropriate CBA techniques can be used as a tool for better understanding the economics of wastewater management as well as cost evaluation to rationalize appropriate investment option in this sector. Aspects of economic analysis and economic feasibility study are also considered for total economic evaluation as it can provide useful information for improving the greywater management and, further, help integrating the environmental and health advantages.

The present work accounts for preparing in-situ nickel-engineered graphitic-layered carbon (Ni@GLC) using different loading of Ni2+ on bagasse waste by carbonization technique. Various spectro-analytical and physiochemical techniques are used to characterize and elucidate the plausible mechanism of in situ carbonization and grafting of Ni on GLC. Initially, the Ni@GLC was employed as an electrocatalyst for OER reaction under ambient conditions. Results revealed that effective nickel loading Ni@GLC-2 showed enhanced electrocatalytic activity with a Tafel slope of 86 mV dec−1 and ɳ of 284 mV (vs. RHE) to drive j10 mA cm−2 in an alkaline medium (pH 13). The material showed 12 h chronoamperometry (CA) stability. Further, in the case of water remediation, Ni@GLC-2 was employed as an adsorbent through the adsorption technique using Methyl orange (MO), Amido black (AB), and regular hair dye (HD) as emerging pollutants. Reaction variables such as the effect of pH and dosage study were investigated and discussed. Results revealed that time-dependent kinetic data was better fitted for the pseudo-second-order model, and isotherm studies with the Langmuir model attained qm capacity of 2232 and 617 mg g−1 for MO and AB, respectively.

After isolation processes, TL is available in large quantities and has favorable compositional characteristics to produce high-performance activated carbons (ACs), such as low amount of residual carbohydrates, high reactivity due to the presence of different functional groups, and high aromatic carbon content. The value of the AC market is projected to reach US$ 7 billion by 2028, led by the water treatment sector. This work provides a brief overview of the status quo in the production of new adsorbents from TL, focusing on biorefineries, together with a bibliometric and patentometric survey. This evidenced a scarcity of publications on this topic, with the primary focus being on chemical modification of TL. A notable increase was observed in the production of ACs for electrochemical applications. Only a few patents were found on the subject, with China predominating technological development in this area. The findings revealed a technical-scientific-economic potential that has been largely unexplored, as no TL-derived AC from 2G biorefineries has yet been produced and applied in water treatment. Hence, there is excellent potential for the wider commercialization of AC produced from TL, representing an excellent opportunity to recycle TL and support the bio-based circular carbon economy, while also contributing to carbon emission neutrality. The marketing of high-performance ACs produced from TL could make biorefineries more profitable and less sensitive to market price fluctuations, while becoming carbon-neutral multiproduct platforms.

Current methods for evaluating water quality often fall short of meeting the needs of water resource management due to the lacks of accuracy and applicability. In this paper, an enhanced water quality evaluation system was established by Principal Component Analysis / Factor Analysis (PCA/FA), Analytic Hierarchy Process / Entropy Weight Method / Game Theory (AHP/EWM/GT) and Variable Fuzzy Set Theory (VFST). The accuracy of this method was verified by evaluating the water quality of a landfill in a karst area and comparing with the conventional evaluation models. The results indicated that the highest influence on groundwater quality in the study area came from human factor, dissolved solid factor, biological factor, and nutritional factor. The quality of surface water and groundwater in the study area was primarily Grade Ⅱ, accounting for 62.5% and 75%, respectively. The predominant groundwater type was HCO3-Ca·Mg, which was strongly affected by karstification. The NH3-N and TP in the surface water had the highest variability, and the variation coefficients of K+, Na+, Ca2+, Cl−, NH3-N, NO3 −, TDS, and TH in the groundwater were greater than 1. The surface water quality gradually improved between 2018 and 2019. Overall, the groundwater quality in the southern and central regions was inferior to that in the northern and surrounding areas. There could be a hydraulic link between the surface water and landfill in the research location, while karstification and leachate primarily impacted the groundwater.

Whilst there has been an improved understanding of the global warming potential of centralized urban water infrastructure, rigorous analyses of smaller-scale rural systems are rare. This work adopts a life cycle assessment to ascertain the global warming potential of existing drinking water treatment works and wastewater treatment works associated with five Scottish islands: Arran, Iona, Jura, Barra, and Vatersay. The water systems, from source to sink, along with the use of chemicals, transportation, energy, and the reuse of waste products from water infrastructure are considered. The global warming potentials of the island's drinking water treatment works ranged from 0.18 to 0.79 kgCO2-eq/m3 of drinking water, while that for wastewater treatment works were 0.51 to 1.14 kgCO2-eq/m3 of wastewater. The global warming potential for water services on the islands can be as much as 7-times of that water services across Scotland as previously reported. Major global warming potential contributor in drinking water treatment works was the electricity consumed by the membrane bioreactors. The modelled direct emission of methane from sludge in septic tanks and for land reclamation made the largest contribution to global warming potential. It was also highly sensitive to model parameters, which highlights the need for a comprehensive exploration of process emissions from septic tanks and sludge handling.

In this study, three freezing temperatures were set to carry out single-stage progressive freezing desalination of brackish water in southern Xinjiang, China. The ice were melted using conventional methods and gravity-induced desalination (GD), and the salt migration law during the icing and melting process was studied. The effect of GD technology on the improvement of the output of frozen desalinated produced water was quantitatively analyzed using scenario simulation. Experimental results showed that salts accumulated towards concentrated water during FD process. The ice total dissolved solids (TDS) increased with decreasing freezing temperature, which was linearly and positively correlated with the raw water TDS. GD efficiency was significantly affected by the salt concentration of ice crystals. In the first stage (the first 450 mL), ice-melt water was salt explosive dissolution, with salt drained mass accounted for more than 85% of the total salt mass. During GD process, exponential decay of ice-melt water TDS (TDSI) was observed with increasing ice-melt water amount. Through the simulation of the two exponential equation scenarios, it was found that Scenario II (mixed water TDSI as the target value) had significantly higher water yield and production rate than Scenario I (TDSI as the target value), with an increase of more than 23%. The algebraic relationship between TDSI of mixed water and the amount of ice-melt water was derived. GD technology can effectively improve the freshwater output efficiency of the FD process, which is manifested by the fact that the ice crystals of the FD process cannot produce freshwater using conventional melting. Scenario II can produce freshwater as high as 69.83% of the total amount of the GD ice-melt water. The GD technology performed increased multiplicatively in WPdv (decrease in water production) and WPRdv (decrease in water production rate) when the TDSI of the mixed water demanded by the user was low. When FD and GD are combined to desalinate salt water, lowering the freezing temperature can significantly increase the freshwater yield, breaking the limitation of freezing temperature for FD. Therefore, an automated, energy-saving freeze desalination-gravity desalination device capable of realizing the collection of the product water according to the users' needs was conceptualized. This study provides new ideas and algorithms for accurately assessing the efficiency of water production in the combined desalination of saltwater by FD and GD.

Previous studies focused on water conflicts among users, overlooking the government's regulatory role in the eco-compensation mechanism and the coordinating function of water transfer compensation fees among users. This study constructed a tripartite evolutionary game model involving government regulatory agencies (GRA), in-channel ecological environment water demanders (EEWD), and off-channel socio-economic water users (SEWU). The evolutionary stability strategies (ESS) of the GRA, EEWD, and SEWU and the evolutionary trend of the tripartite system were analyzed using the finite rationality evolutionary game model, and the sensitivity analysis of the influencing factors was conducted using the eigenvalues of the Jacobi matrix and numerical simulation. Taking the Bai River Basin in Nanyang, China, as the case study, the results showed that the GRA's rewards and penalties were controlled within a reasonable range can promote the enthusiasm of the participating subjects in the water quantity compensation mechanism; water quantity compensation standard for the SEWU was an important indicator for the smooth implementation of the compensation mechanism, the loss coefficient and the overall ecological benefit allocation coefficient of the EEWD will influence the formulation of water quantity compensation standards. This suggested that the GRA should enhance the management of the eco-compensation-related policies and laws and regulations, limit the SEWU's eco-compensation standard, and improve the net benefit of EEWD, to achieve the optimal eco-compensation strategy of ''supervision, protection, compensation''.

This matter is particularly crucial in developing countries where dense urban areas experience unexpectedly growing populations. Herein, we study the capacity upgrading of a WWTP working by a conventional activated sludge (CAS) system from 180,000 m3/d to 240,000 and 300,000 m3/d. The WWTP case study focuses on a large plant in Mansoura, Egypt, requiring capacity upgrades to accommodate population growth. For this purpose, we used mathematical modeling to simulate current and suggested WWTP designs. Moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and integrated fixed film-activated sludge (IFAS) systems were designed to increase the WWTP capacity to 240,000 and 300,000 m3/d by the addition of plastic biofilm carrier to 25% and 50% of the aeration basins, respectively. IFAS outperformed conventional and MBBR systems in terms of BOD, COD, TSS, NH4, TP, and PO4, in addition to increased capacity. We moreover used life cycle assessment (LCA) to comprehend the environmental favorability of upgrading scenarios. The most affected environmental categories are global warming and eutrophication due to the operation stage (especially electricity).

However, the poor purification capacity for wastewater and difficult liquid phase dispersion of natural starch severely hindered its application in wastewater treatment and limited the development of starch materials. Hence, a series of cationic starches with different particle sizes were fabricated by controlling the acidification time and combining starch with N-2,3-epoxy-propyl trimethyl ammonium chloride to improve the dispersion and purification effect of starch in water. Acid hydrolysis could destroy the spatial structure of starch, which improved the etherification property to enhance the purification property of starch to different pollutants and the dispersed stable state in water.

However, their practical application is limited because of inevitable cathodic scaling. To overcome this challenge, one necessary approach is to understand the ion migration mechanism in the typical IEM reactor. In this study, we used operando visualization to reveal that the divider such as IEM or nylon nets was essential to confine the neutralization reaction between H+ and OH−. Ca2+ and Mg2+ may transfer from the anode chamber through the divider into the cathode chamber via electromigration. Using mesh electrodes instead of plate electrodes, the total hardness removal in the cathode chamber and anode chamber was 94.2% and 92.5%, respectively. The high removal rate was attributed to H2 microbubbles produced by cathodic water electrolysis, which drove OH− ions diffusion into solution and sequentially strengthened the nucleation of scale crystals in solution rather than on the cathode surface. On the basis of the above ion migration mechanism, the revolutionized reactor with mesh electrode module and nylon-net divider exhibited good performance in softening real circulating cooling water, and the total hardness removal exceeded 93.1% during 30 h running.

However, due to the special chain-like structure of Anabaena, the removal characteristics of Anabaena in water treatment process are quite different from those of unicellular cyanobacteria. No study has yet systematic studied on the enhancement effect of ultrasonic enhanced water treatment process on Anabaena. Therefore, this paper studied the characteristics and mechanism of ultrasonic pretreatment to enhance the removal of Anabaena, and carried out pilot experiments. The results showed that ultrasound irradiation at 740 kHz and 1.12 MHz had a great effect on the destruction of the chain-like structure and cell structure of Anabaena. After 15 min, the removal rate of Anabaena cells reached 16.0% and 30.4%, respectively, and the release of intracellular organic matter (IOM) reached 4.3 and 6.0 mg/L, in which phycocyanin released more. The damage of dynamic ultrasound irradiation on algae cells is weak, which can avoid the influence of uneven ultrasound irradiation on algae cells. The enhanced coagulation effect was better after 740 kHz ultrasonic pretreatment for 1 min, and the removal rates of algal cells, turbidity and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) increased by 7%, 9.4% and 12.6%, respectively.

The results showed that photovoltaic systems increased water uptake by the dominant species Leymus chinensis from the top 10 cm of the soil and the aboveground biomass. This was associated with strong plasticity of roots and conduction tissues, which improved resource uptake from the fertile surface soil and transport within the plant, and promoted photosynthesis and leaf water loss by inducing stomatal opening.

One of the most affordable methods for small-medium mills is to send OMW to industrial wastewater treatment plants (IWTP). Accordingly, this work explored a strategy consisting of the biological co-treatment of real OMW and simulated urban wastewater by a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR), with and without (electro)Fenton pre-treatment, to simulate OMW treatment through a multi-barrier approach in an IWTP. The effluent of the MBBR without pre-treatment, despite the long period of operation of 18 months, was in compliance with the limit for total phenols (TPHs) of 0.5 mg/L only at a really low OMW's dilution ratio (DR) (1/4000 (v/v)). The Fenton oxidation (FO) and the electro-assisted Fenton (EAF) processes were investigated as pre-treatment of diluted OMW. FO resulted in good performances in terms of TPHs removal (81%) and improved biodegradability (final BOD5/COD ratio = 0.35) but in poor COD removal (24%). EAF was more effective (COD removal = 41%, TPHs removal = 85%, and final BOD5/COD ratio = 0.40) than FO. Therefore, EAF was finally investigated on undiluted OMW (COD removal = 56%, TPHs removal = 84%, and final BOD5/COD ratio = 0.62) and subsequently co-treated with simulated urban wastewater by MBBR, identifying 1/1000 as the optimal DR.

Experiments and density functional theory calculations illustrated that the introduced piezoelectric field directionally tuned the energy band structure of heterostructure, triggering a change in the electron transfer path within the heterostructure, which facilitated the major electrons transferred to zinc oxide (H2 evolution) and holes accumulated in molybdenum sulfide (hydroxyl radical generation), further accelerating contaminants degradation and H2 evolution. Furthermore, the in-depth mechanism of contaminants degradation and H2 evolution under the influence of piezoelectric field was further explored. The piezo-photocatalytic system of this work first accomplished H2 recovery in wastewater treatment on heterostructure, providing a constructive strategy for the design of environmentally sustainable catalytic systems.

Here, the distribution of ZnO-NPs along with its impact on metabolism in microalgal-bacterial granular sludge (MBGS) was studied. The results showed that over 95% of ZnO-NPs in the MBGS system were absorbed by sludge or enriched in the sludge layer in the form of zinc oxide, while releasing a small amount of Zn2+. The adsorption of ZnO-NPs by MBGS mainly relied on the –OH functional groups and protein structures. After ZnO-NPs adsorption, the cell membrane could be destroyed, resulting in the release of lactate dehydrogenase. At the genetic level, ZnO-NPs promoted gene abundance levels related to biological processes and enzyme glycosyl transferase synthesis, but inhibited intracellular biosynthesis and metabolism of genetic material, especially glutathione synthesis. Key functional and biosynthetic genes involved in metabolic processes were also inhibited, such as acs and glnA. This study explained in detail how ZnO-NPs altered and impacted on MBGS, which provided a reference for future practical applications of MBGS for wastewater treatment containing nanoparticles.

In this study, the influence of high ammonia concentrations (1000–2000 mg/L) on pollutants removal and microbial response in high-sulfate wastewater was investigated. Surprisingly, our study found a robust ammonia resilience, as demonstrated by the stable removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD) at 60.64% and sulfate at 79.76%. The core functional bacteria, Desulfovibrio and Erysipelatoclostridium, responsible for sulfate and COD removal, were discovered to remain at a relative abundance of up to 47.61% and 40.22%, respectively. Metagenomic analysis showed that three bins assigned to Desulfovibrio contain genes encoding glucokinase (glk), phosphofohexokinase (PFK) and pyruvate kinase (PK), indicating their capability for complete carbon metabolism. Of significance, this study revealed a remarkable amount of gene up-regulation involved in sulfur metabolism, showing resilience against ammonia stress. Unexpectedly, a positive correlation (p < 0.05) was observed between genes (aroAC and trpABDFG) responsible for tryptophan biosynthesis and the relative abundance of Erysipelatoclostridium. The complete genetic pathway for tryptophan biosynthesis was uncovered in two bins associated with Erysipelatoclostridium, suggesting potential interspecies cross-feeding between Erysipelatoclostridium and Desulfovibrio for maintaining functional stability.

However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive analysis on the potential benefits of FPV. Utilizing reservoir databases and employing a professional FPV system design, a methodology for determining the water footprint recovery period was introduced, which enables the assessment of potential FPV benefits. The water footprint recovery period for constructing FPV on 909 reservoirs in China was found that ranges from 1.86 yr to 10.48 yr. It is found that reservoir evaporation, latitude, and climate are closely related to the water footprint recovery period of FPV. Furthermore, by implementing FPV panels with an optimal tilt angle, covering 30% of the area in each reservoir, the annual electricity generation can amount to 1429.19 TWh, leading to savings of 5.76 billion m3 of water. This achievement corresponds to 19.41% of the national electricity consumption and a 6.86% reduction in the national residential water consumption in 2020. The overall economic benefit is 5.61 myriads RMB, equivalent to 5.76% of the national GDP. These benefits are unevenly distributed and mainly concentrated in areas with more reservoirs. The anticipated enhancement of FPV system benefits is foreseen with the ongoing development and implementation of future reservoir power infrastructure and energy storage technology. These results demonstrate the significant potential of installing FPV systems on the reservoirs in China. This study proposes a method to comprehensively evaluate the comprehensive benefits of constructing FPV in China and conduct a thorough analysis of the feasibility of FPV, which could provide reference for the development of regional industries and the achievement of sustainable development goals (SDGs).

However, there is seldom analysis on how the water environment regulation influences an enterprise's innovation due to data deficiency. Using our database from 2000 to 2022, we combine geographic information from water quality monitoring stations with the data on listed companies in China to pinpoint what distance firms are exposed to the monitoring stations. Results from a spatial regression discontinuity design along the geographic distances demonstrate that water environmental regulation has a significant positive impact on the quantity and quality of enterprise innovation. This paper found that it is primarily driven by the decreased usage of intermediate goods, rising industry profits from the exit of low-productivity firms, and enhanced enterprise research and development (R&D) investment. Furthermore, the positive impact is more pronounced for privately-owned firms, firms closer to suppliers, polluting firms, and politically unaffiliated firms.

The coupled process not only realized about 70% desalination of seawater, 90% removal of 200 mg/L ampicillin (AMP) and 3.2 g/L H2O2 production at 4 V, but also showed the ability to effectively remove various contaminants including rhodamine B, urea, nitrobenzene and quinoline. The coupled process represented a great processing capacity for 100–300 mg/L AMP and seawater with 15–45 g/L NaCl. The mechanism exploration indicated the electrodialysis and electrocatalysis worked synergistically. The electrodialysis could generate an internal potential of 0.5 V to promote the electrocatalysis, and provide Cl− and Na+ as the electrolytes for electrocatalysis. Furthermore, the chlorine evolution reaction through electrocatalysis improved efficiency of electron transfer, resulting in a higher AMP removal and H2O2 production. Radical scavenging experiments and chemical analysis indicated that •OH and reactive chlorine species (RCS) accounted for 70% and 30% for AMP removal in anode chamber.

In this paper, novel Fe–Mn bimetallic catalysts were synthesized by Mn doped different precursors of morphologies α-Fe2O3 with one pot hydrothermal method, and then activated peroxymonosulfate (PMS) to degrade tetracycline (TC), as a model of medicaments in the water environment. Meanwhile, density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed the Fe–Mn bimetallic catalyst was favored for activating PMS. Notably, the treatment rate of TC was 90.7% within 60 min in the FMDS-3 + PMS system. Besides, the FMDS-3 bimetallic catalyst presented excellent repeatability, and its system treatment rate achieved 75% after repeated use nine times. Subsequently, the adsorption energy reached −6.857 eV as FMDS-3 adsorbed PMS, and differential charge density also clearly indicated that electron transfer was more active in the FMDS-3 + PMS system. In further research on the density of states, the electron spin of the FMDS-3 bimetallic catalyst made its characteristic peak closer to the Fermi level, which promoted the adsorption of PMS on its catalyst.

Also, the phosphorus removal process in wastewater treatment plants produces large amounts of sludge containing FP. It is a huge waste of both iron and phosphorus resources if such FP cannot be utilized. This work explores a new strategy for utilizing FP to activate sulfite (S(IV)) autoxidation for simultaneous pollutant degradation and phosphorus release in water. Acid orange 7 (AO7) and several pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) were chosen as the target pollutants for the FP‒S(IV) system and the influence of pH, FP and S(IV) dosage were investigated. Typically, up to 89.5% AO7 (10 mg L−1) and above 60% PPCPs (10 μM) were oxidized within 90 min by adding 1 g L−1 FP and 2 mM S(IV) into the water at the initial pH 4.0. Results of quenching experiments and electron spin resonance analysis confirmed SO5 •− as the dominant reactive species for AO7 oxidation. Meanwhile, two stages of phosphorus release from FP were observed along with the AO7 oxidation and their linear correlation over the pH range 3.0–8.0 was proven. The first stage (0–5 min) was thought to be dependent on the initial pH and was obviously faster than the second stage (10–45 min), whose rate increased linearly with S(IV) dosage. Phosphorus released high up to 24.3 μM at 90 min with 4 mM S(IV). Moreover, the mechanisms of FP activated sulfite autoxidation as well as phosphorus release were proposed, and the AO7 degradation pathway was investigated.

The need arises to understand hydrothermal carbonization's (HTC) potential in nutrient and resource recovery from this biomass. While willows are well-studied in bioenergy, their utility in HTC remains understudied. We investigated the unexplored HTC of EWS-sourced willows. Here, we demonstrate that combining the robust biomass yield of a zero-discharge willow system—56 t DM⋅ha−1 over a three-year rotation—with HTC yields hydrochars, enabling phosphorus recovery (13–52 kg P⋅ha−1) and carbon sequestration (9–17 t C⋅ha−1). In a broader perspective, 10-ha willow systems can sequester about 117-tons of carbon annually, with hydrochars contributing 90-tons and an additional 27-tons attributed to the root system. Moreover, recirculating HTC-process water through hydrochar can increase the recovery to about 130–280-kg of phosphorus annually. We noted HTC-reactivity variations between a natural Salix variant and a wastewater-optimized clone. We used custom-engineered reactors and a two-factor experimental design that varied the HTC temperatures (225, 250, 275, and 300 °C) and reaction times (10, 20, 30, and 60 min), maintaining a 1:10 dry biomass-to-water mass ratio and heating rate at ∼59 °C⋅min−1. Hydrochars show improved fuel properties and energy content—Higher heating value of 22–28 MJ⋅kg−1, aligning closely with mineral coals. These hydrochars also showcased enhanced thermal stability, heightened aromaticity, and increased fixed carbon content (14–45 %). Remarkably, phosphorus densification in hydrochars reached up to 100 % during HTC reactions. Chemical P-extractions indicated a high P-bioavailability in the willow-woodchips and a low potential for phosphorus leaching in hydrochars, with 87 % of total-P extractable using HCL. Our findings offer a preliminary framework for bridging EWS in the domains of hydrothermal processes as an opportunity for future integration in biorefineries.";"2024-02-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652624004098";"3";"Water Refinement"

Untreated sewage disposal from municipalities, industrial wastewater, and numerous recreational and commercial activities along the coast not only deteriorates the water quality but also poses a significant threat to the marine ecosystem, food chain, and public health. Therefore, continuous monitoring of coastal water quality is essential for the sustainable upkeep of marine and aquatic ecosystems. The study aims to assess the intra- and interannual variability of coastal water quality in the Sundarbans estuarine system, straddling the borders of India and Bangladesh. The study employed Landsat 8 OLI satellite data and in-situ measurements of water quality parameters, including temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, phosphate, total phosphate, nitrate, and nitrite. These measurements were obtained from 100 sampling locations across the entire Sundarban estuarine ecosystem. The data collection spanned the pre-monsoon, monsoon, and post-monsoon periods in the years 2021 and 2022. Several sophisticated machine learning models, including Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were employed to precisely forecast various crucial water quality indicators. Cross-validation results showed that the random forest model is most promising, with R2 values ranging between 0.50 and 0.96, followed by the artificial neural network (R2 values ranging between 0.36 and 0.97), the support vector machine (R2 values ranging between 0.29 and 0.97), and the KNN (R2 values ranging between 0.26 and 0.94). Subsequently, a random forest algorithm was customized for the study area to compute the coastal water quality index on a seasonal scale for the years 2021 and 2022. Results reveal that the concentrations of dissolved oxygen, phosphate, total phosphate, nitrate, nitrite, pH, and water temperature were relatively higher during the pre-monsoon and post-monsoon seasons compared to the monsoon season. In situ and remote sensing data analysis confirmed that Sundarbans estuarine water quality was relatively good during the monsoon period as compared to the rest of the year. In addition, research also highlighted the significance of monsoonal rainfall in the watershed for maintaining coastal water quality. It is estimated that the coastal water was particularly vulnerable due to the combined effects of industrial waste water and municipal sewage discharge. Ultimately, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning models and remote sensing in predicting the condition of coastal waters. The findings of this research can offer significant perspectives to decision-makers in developing a sustainable strategy for the management of coastal water resources.

Discharging nutrient-rich secondary effluents from municipal wastewater treatment plants exacerbates this problem. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of a pilot-scale Ion Exchange Membrane Bioreactor (IEMB) in removing nitrate from secondary treated effluent. The process involved Donnan dialysis (DD) followed by heterotrophic denitrification in an anoxic fixed bed bioreactor (FBBR). DD process demonstrated an efficiency of over 75 % when nitrate was externally spiked in the secondary treated effluent and over 90 % without spiking, reaching final concentrations below 5.65 mg NO3–N/L and 1.1 mg NO3–N/L, respectively. Furthermore, denitrification in FBBR was greater than 95 % at C/N ratio of 1.8–2 provided in the form of glycerol at an HRT of 2 h when nitrate was not spiked externally. Though sulphate accumulation occurred in the receiver (bio-side) during DD, denitrification outperformed sulphate reduction, as confirmed by the favourable oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) readings (−50 to −200 mV) in the FBBR reactor. Optimal conditions for nitrate removal, considering chemical and energy consumption, resulted in a cost of $0.237 per cubic meter of treated secondary effluent during continuous operation. A life cycle assessment (LCA) was also conducted to understand the environmental impacts of the IEMB. In light of these findings, IEMB showed a promising potential for tertiary wastewater treatment, providing an economical and sustainable solution for nutrient removal and indirect potable reuse of treated wastewater.

This study investigated the pollution characteristics, origins, and health risks associated with eighteen toxic metal (loid)s (TMs) across various depths in five cascade reservoirs located in the upper Mekong. The findings revealed that naturally sourced TMs (As, Cd, Li, Mo, Sb, and Sr) exhibited elevated levels in upstream reservoirs due to the interception effects of cascade dams. Anthropogenically sourced TMs (Co, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) showed heightened concentrations in downstream reservoirs, linked to increased human activities in the downstream region. In deep-water reservoirs, the vertical distribution of redox-sensitive elements was influenced by thermal stratification, with concentrations of As, Cs, Li, Mo, Rb, Sr, and U notably higher in the hypolimnion than the epilimnion. Importantly, the concentrations of all elements in these cascade reservoirs meet Chinese and WHO drinking water standards. Water quality index (WQI: 9.2–19.1), heavy metal evaluation index (HEI: 0.96–1.37), and Nemerow index (NI: 0.35–0.56) confirmed the commendable quality of the cascade reservoir waters. The health risk assessment identified As, Sb, U, and Tl as primary contributors to non-carcinogenic risks in the cascade reservoirs.

The present paper proposes a novel ZLD technology based on solvent extraction desalination (SED) to avoid the intensive use of high-grade electrical energy and steam. Three amines are compared for the water extraction and salt precipitation performance from desulphurization wastewater simulated by NaCl and Na2SO4 solution. Results show that with the same volume ratio, diisopropylamine exhibits the optimized extraction performance, while N,N-dimethylcyclohexylamine has the highest ions removal efficiency of over 98 %. Diisopropylamine is selected as the target solvent for further evaluation regarding its feasibility. The detailed analysis indicates that for 100 mL of wastewater, the corresponding solvent volume to achieve ZLD is 300 mL, 400 mL and 600 mL when the extraction temperature is 5°C, 10°C and 15°C, respectively. High water recovery efficiencies and salt removal efficiencies within five repeated ZLD tests highlights the reusability performance of SED. In addition, a novel SED-ZLD system with the flue gas before desulphurization as heat source is proposed. Thermodynamic calculation results show that for 5 t/h of wastewater, less than 50,000 m3/h of flue gas is sufficient for heating.

Through lab and pilot experiments on the anaerobic treatment process of high-salt wastewater, combined with different prediction requirements, the feature variables are classified. The effluent-COD and VFA prediction models of five different Machine-learning methods (i.e., back propagation neural network (BPNN), Genetic algorithm optimizes BPNN(GA-BP), support vector machine (SVM), Least squares support vector machine (LSSVM), and random forest (RF)) were established. The modeling results on different dataset (i.e., lab dataset, pilot dataset and mixed dataset) showed that the SVM and LSSVM methods based on statistical learning had the best model prediction performance in lab and pilot datasets, and the RF method performed well in mixed dataset. Furthermore, the genetic algorithm was adopted to optimize the RF model. After optimization of mixed dataset, the effluent-COD prediction (i.e., R2 = 0.966, RMSE/MAE are 61.227/48.584 mg/L) and VFA prediction (i.e., R2 = 0.639, RMSE/MAE are 26.838/21.831 mg/L) have been improved compared with the original RF model (i.e., R2 = 0.918, RMSE/MAE are 86.232/65.03 mg/L of effluent-COD, and R2 = 0.539, RMSE/MAE are 35.489/26.726 mg/L of VFA).

However, the presence of chloride ions (Cl−) in waters can accelerate anodic corrosion as well as lead to the formation of toxic chlorinated byproducts (i.e., ClO4 −), limiting its practical application. In this study, we introduce a novel Nd/Bi@SnO2 anode to construct E-PS, which exhibits high stability in chloride-containing water with a long-expected service lifetime of 13.7 years. The Nd/Bi@SnO2 electrode can effectively convert Cl− to reactive chlorine with the assistance of PMS, triggering singlet oxygen (1O2) generation for superior organic removal while avoiding toxic chlorinated byproducts (i.e., ClO4 −) generation as well as greatly reducing the energy consumption. Comprehensive structural and electrochemical characterization results demonstrate Nd/Bi co-doping introduces oxygen vacancy on Nd/Bi@SnO2, enabling the anode with high oxygen evolution potential, excellent conductivity and superior stability. Scavenging experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance illustrate the generation of various reactive species in the system, among which 1O2 predominantly contributes to organic removal and results in harmless intermediates.

The extraction of reservoir operation rules from massive historical operational data still remains a challenge. Therefore, a novel framework for extracting the operation rules of cascade reservoirs was proposed in this study based on artificial intelligence models by considering hydrometeorological spatiotemporal information. First, the observed precipitation was obtained by merging multi-source precipitation products through a convolutional long-short-term memory (ConvLSTM) network. Second, a novel extraction model by considering hydrometeorological spatiotemporal information was established, comprising a process of capturing the spatiotemporal information of interval precipitation using ConvLSTM and a feature aggregation process of aggregating precipitation and reservoir historical operation information using an LSTM network. Finally, three different extraction strategies (recursive, direct, and multi-input multi-output (MIMO) strategies) for cascade reservoir operation rules were developed and compared, and the influence of future multi-step forecast information was analyzed. Considering the example of Yalong River, the results are as follows: (1) the proposed extraction model has excellent fitting performance with a Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (NSE) of more than 0.95 and mean relative error (MRE) of less than 10 %, especially in reservoirs with large regulation capacity; (2) according to the regulation capacity of the reservoirs and reliability of forecast precipitation, appropriately adding multi-step forecast information can improve the performance of the extraction models; (3) each reservoir's NSE when using the three strategies is above 0.9, indicating that they can all be used to extract the operation rules of the cascade reservoir.

The search for alternative water sources and low-energy alternative methods has been necessitated especially for drinking water treatment plants (DWTPs) operations. The study investigates the inherent relationships between water, energy, and carbon emissions in DWTP operations using the systematic review method. A total of 93 bibliographic records were analyzed. Data shows that research trends have increased in recent years, peaking in 2011 and 2021, with the US, Spain, and Saudi Arabia making significant advances in the research domain.

This study aimed to simultaneously remediate the water contaminated by Sb and As and realize the resource utilization of solid waste. Herein, electrolytic manganese residue (EMR)-biochar composite (EB) was prepared by a one-step pyrolysis method using the mixture of EMR and distillers grains for the removal of As(III, V) and Sb(III, V) from water. The results indicated that the optimal pyrolysis temperature and EMR to distillers grains mass ratio for EB removal of As(III, V) and Sb(III, V) were 750 °C and 3∶1, respectively. The removal of As(III, V) and Sb(III, V) by EB was inhibited to varying degrees by HCO3 −, PO4 3−, and humic acid.

Herein, the doping technique was applied to modify the biosynthetic hydroxyapatite, and the maximum defluoridation efficiency (90.37%) was obtained in the La@HAP system. The introduction of Fe and Al species prominently reduced the dosage of La species while ensuring the ideal defluoridation effect.

The performance of solar stills is highly contingent on environmental factors, making it essential to address these variables. To achieve this, a double-slope single basin solar distiller (DSBD) was upgraded by incorporating a partially coated absorber plate with ZnO/PVC/Bioactive nanocomposite (ZPBN), which was subsequently examined for its impact on drinking water production from multiple perspectives, including energy, exergy, environmental, and economic considerations. The ZPBN material was synthesized using the solvent casting technique, and its properties were comprehensively characterized through various analytical methods. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis revealed a regular crystalline lattice structure amidst an amorphous background, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images confirmed its surface performance. The presence of ZnO nanoparticles within the PVC and bioactive matrix imparted enhanced thermal characteristics to the DSBD, including higher temperatures, specific heats, and thermal stability compared to the ZPBN. The study demonstrated that the introduction of ZPBN significantly increased drinking water yield by up to 126% due to its enhanced absorption of solar energy. Furthermore, the energy efficiency of the DSBD improved by 0.44%, while its exergy efficiency decreased by 0.25% when compared to a conventional double slope single basin solar distiller (CDSBD) under the tropical climate conditions of Vijayawada, India. In terms of energy matrices, the ZPBN-coated basin area exhibited minimum and maximum energy payback times of 6.55 years and 0.15 years, respectively. Over its lifetime, the DSBD was found to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 2.97 tonnes and offered the lowest cost per litre, amounting to $0.0360. The incorporation of ZPBN on the absorber plate within the DSBD resulted in excellent environmental and energy economies, with values of 4.640 kWh/$ and $83.210, respectively.

The crucial point is placed on the systematic explanation of recent advancements and the technical obscurities associated with diverse catalytic composite materials-based photocatalytic degradation of BPA. Specifically, we have focused on the BPA removal performance of TiO2, graphitic carbon nitride, metal-organic framework, and miscellaneous composite photocatalytic materials in light of advanced photophysical/physicochemical properties (e.g., structural tunability, optical properties, charge-carrier dynamics, capability of active sites, incident light absorption capability, and BPA adsorption and oxidation potential). The operating performance of photocatalytic systems applied for BPA removal has been accentuated by the evaluation of three key performance metrics such as quantum yield, spacetime yield, and figures of merit. The future perspectives of a photocatalytic system are also explored with respect to the control of hazardous by-product formation, hydrogen/electrical energy recovery, and adaptation of advanced ROS analysis techniques. The overall outcomes of this detailed review are expected to be advantageous for further advancement in next-generation advanced composite photocatalytic materials in order to adapt a real-world applicable option for an efficient emerging organic contaminant contained wastewater management.

Factors such as calcination temperature, the addition amount of WS2 in FeWO4/Cu2S, molar ratio of Cu/Fe in FeWO4/Cu2S, catalyst dosage, solution pH, inorganic anions and natural organic matters（NOM）were investigated. It was found that in FeWO4/Cu2S at 1:2 possessed the best catalytic performance for PMS. FeWO4/Cu2S performed well in a wide pH range (3–9) and the effect was better under acidic conditions. A high catalyst dosage could supply more catalytic active sites for PMS activation and encourage the production of reactive oxygen species. Anions (HCO3 −and HPO4 2−) and NOM significantly inhibited SCP degradation, whereas Cl− had only a tiny inhibitory impact. In addition, H2PO4 − and NO3 − demonstrated duality in the degradation of SCP. The oxidation process was dominated by non free radical oxidation by 1O2 rather than free radicals oxidation by HO⋅ and SO4 •−. Three SCP degradation pathways—SO2 extrusion, S-N bond cleavage and hydroxylation were proposed according to intermediate products analysis. The mechanism was found that the introduction of W improved the dual metals cycles of Fe3+/Fe2+ and Cu+/Cu2+ which could efficiently promote PMS activation. In addition, the magnetic FeWO4/Cu2S was easy to separate after reaction, which had great application potential in the water treatment.

Finding an effective method for controlling membrane biofouling caused by TEP is essential for the long-term stable operation of membrane systems. The results of this experimental study show that the coupling process of magnetic ion exchange resin (MIEX)/Ultrafiltration (UF) can significantly mitigate membrane biofouling induced by TEP. Compared with the UF process, the irreversible growth rate of TEP on the membrane in the MIEX/UF process decreased by 75.9%, and the synergistic irreversible accumulation rate of TEP and bacteria decreased by 81.2%. The irreversible adhesion of bacteria to the membrane was significantly reduced, effectively inhibiting the formation of the primary level of biofilm and the development of biofouling. Further analysis showed that the MIEX inhibited the conversion of TEP precursors to TEP, and the quaternary ammonium salt functional groups on the surface of the MIEX sterilized bacteria and inhibited their proliferation in water. More importantly, because the interfacial forces between TEP/bacteria and MIEX were much higher than those between them and the UF membrane, the deposition of MIEX on the membrane surface not only prevented TEP and bacteria from reaching the membrane surface, but also removed the deposited TEP and bacteria from the membrane surface by hydraulic backwashing.

Dissolved oxygen is one of the main factors affecting denitrification and phosphorus accumulation, and there is currently little research on the oxygen sensing regulation mechanism of Thauera bacteria. We studied denitrifying phosphorus accumulation and gene transcription expression of Thauera sp. RT1901 in anaerobic, microaerobic, and aerobic environments and analyzed the protein structure and regulation mode of two oxygen-sensing systems. The results showed that the strain could achieve the similar denitrification and phosphorus accumulation effect in microaerobic environment as in anaerobic environment. Transcriptome analysis showed that as the oxygen concentration continued to rise, the core carbon and phosphorus metabolism pathways of the strain remained unchanged, and the respiratory system shifted from nitrate respiration to aerobic respiration, thereby inhibiting the denitrification pathway. The fumarate nitrate reduction (FNR) protein and FixLJ two-component system performed oxygen sensing to jointly regulate the expression of respiratory genes. The FNR protein formed a dimer in an anaerobic environment, activating denitrification-related genes and inhibiting cytochrome oxidase-related genes. The FixLJ system conducted signal transduction through phosphorylation in a low oxygen environment and activated the transcription of the fixK gene. The FixK protein has a similar structure and function as the FNR protein but is not directly affected by oxygen. These results reveal the oxygen sensing regulation mechanism of Thauera sp.

However, the intricate interplay of how floc structure induced by coagulation hydraulic shear influences the cake layer and filtration performance in coagulation macro-filtration of microalgae remains unexplored. In this study, a novel coagulation filtration with macro-pore of 75 μm was first adopted for the rapid removal of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, and the floc structure was artificially manipulated through various velocity gradients to explore the effect mechanism of the coagulation hydrodynamic shear on the macro-filtration performance from the perspectives of floc characteristics (size and fractal dimension) and cake layer structure (thickness and roughness). The results showed that an optimal average flux of 31257.64 ± 2776.28 L·m−2·h−1 can be achieved at a manipulated appropriate velocity gradient (19 s−1), which is 1.1–2.3 times the flux achieved at higher or non-velocity gradients. The flocs formed at low velocity gradient were large and loose, while those formed at high velocity gradient were small and compact. Subsequently, the cake layer stacked by loose flocs was thicker and coarser than that by compact flocs, and exhibited a lower specific cake resistance, yielding a higher average flux. Moreover, a theoretical model for average flux was developed by introducing the velocity gradient, which directly elucidates how hydrodynamic shear affects floc characteristic, cake structure and filtration flux for the coagulation macro-filtration of Aphanizomenon flos-aquae.

And it was found to be mainly owing to the role of Fe(IV) and electron transfer induced by doped Cu. Specifically speaking, the doped Cu caused over an order of magnitude increase in Fe(IV) formation from 1.84×10−10 M to 4.75 × 10−9 M. And the more significant electron transfer between nZVI/Cu@BC, PDS and SMZ was confirmed by series electrochemical tests. In contrast, the formation of SO4 ·- and OH was still at a low concentration, playing a small role. The different activation mechanisms were identified to be that doped Cu provided Cu(Ⅰ)/Cu(Ⅱ) cycle to accelerate Fe(Ⅱ)/Fe(Ⅲ) cycle for enhanced PDS activation. Besides, the Fe0/Cu0 co-active sites appeared on the material surface after nZVC doping, exhibiting a stronger interaction with PDS.

Further exploration indicates that DIF has a more significant impact on UWE in cities with populations exceeding 5 million, no water resource tax, and strict environmental regulation. The combined efforts of financial and environmental regulation by the Chinese government play a key role in strengthening the positive relationship between DIF and UWE. Consequently, this research provides stronger evidence that financial development enhances environmental efficiency and offers new insights for urban water resource management.

A novel biocarrier (MBF@FMJSB) assembled with modified basalt fiber and modified wild jujube seed biochar (FMJSB) was used to construct fixed-biofilm reactor (FBR) for concurrent removal of nitrate, TC, and Cd2+. The removal efficiencies of nitrate, TC, and Cd2+ of the bioreactor were 79.34%, 85.45%, and 88.02%, respectively, when HRT was 6.0 h, C/N ratio was 1.5, influent nitrate concentration was 25 mg L−1, pH was 6.5, and TC and Cd2+ concentrations was 0.6 and 1 mg L−1. The addition of FMJSB was not only beneficial for bacteria to resist the stress of TC and Cd2+, but also contributed to the removal of TC and Cd2+ pollutants. In addition, microbial metabolism was a key pathway for pollutant removal in FBR. Microflora with Zoogloea as a core genus can dynamically regulate the community structure and expression of microbial metabolism related genes to adapt to TC and Cd2+ stresses. This study was valuable for the treatment of wastewater containing mixed pollutants. ";"2024-01-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623043482";"12";"Water Refinement"

The SLS/DTPA@ZIF-8 adsorbent exhibited excellent performance in removing heavy metal ions (Pb2+) and cationic dyes (methylene blue, MB and crystal violet, CV) from wastewater. To determine the maximum adsorption capacity, various influencing factors such as contact time, initial concentration of contaminant solution, adsorbent dosage and pH of solution were systematically discussed. The maximum adsorption capacities of Pb2+, MB and CV were calculated from Langmuir isotherm model to be 1021.85, 890.90 and 827.54 mg g−1, respectively (C0 (Pb2+) = 100 mg L−1, C0 (MB) = C0 (CV) = 25 mg L−1, pH = 6 ± 0.2, dosage = 0.2 g L−1 and T = 298K). The results of adsorption kinetic and isotherm experiments indicate that the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir isotherm models are most appropriate for describing physical and chemical adsorption processes occurring simultaneously. The XPS results confirmed that functional groups containing O and C were involved in the interaction of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic attraction between pollutants and hydrogel adsorbents. Additionally, the adsorbent's regeneration capabilities were studied. Five regeneration cycles later, the adsorbent still had good adsorption performance for the target pollutant. Overall, the present study shows a low-cost, green and efficient hydrogel adsorbent that exhibits remarkable efficacy in removing Pb2+ and dye from aqueous solutions.

In this study, the REWAS tool developed by FAO and Future Water was used to evaluate the effects of technological and management strategies on real water savings (RWS) in the Zarrineh River sub-basin, Iran. Nine farms were investigated (wheat, corn, tomato, sugar beet), including control and treatment farms. According to changes in water consumption and return flows, RWS was calculated for various scenarios of field interventions. To assess the water consumption in Basin scale, REWAS was simplified the accounting framework for water consumption (consumed and unconsumed). In the Zarrineh River sub-basin, the use of the techniques applied in the treatment farm, compared to the control farm (according to farmer customary practices), resulted in a significant reduction of non-beneficial consumption. For example, according to the REWAS evaluation in West s17 farn, the treatment farm consumed the most useful water compared to the control farm (331 mm and 267 mm, respectively), which led to the most useful water consumption at basin scale (to the order of 3920 mm and 3166 mm). According to the results on the scale of the basin , the highest amount of recoverable discharge was also obtained in the control farm with an increase of 3774 MCM over the treatment farm. Using strategies to reduce water consumption resulted in apparent water saving (AWS) at the farm scale, but these AWS were very different from their RWS at the basin scale and the RWS at the basin scale (13%) was much lower than the AWS at the farm scale (38%). According to the results, apparent water savings (AWS) at the farm scale do not reduce water consumption, and may actually increase it when viewed in a basin scale. REWAS concepts indicate that significant amounts of “lost” water are actually recoverable return flows that can be used by downstream users or contribute to wetlands. According to REWAS concepts, real water savings can only be achieved by preventing non-recyclable backflows. Assessing RWS can help decision makers select sustainable interventions that will improve agricultural water productivity by providing information on farm flows, irrigation networks, and basin scales.

Under simulated sunlight irradiation, the optimal ratio of CFO/ZIS composites (CFO/ZIS-2) achieved a reduction rate of about 99% for Cr(VI) within 20 min, and a degradation rate of about 73% for CIP within 60 min.

Spain is among the European countries facing considerable water shortage problems, particularly within its southern regions. The current paper introduces an efficiency evaluation model based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The model incorporates a subset of outputs as undesirable inputs to account for the circularity of the production process by means of treated and reused water. The main differences existing between the circular approach proposed, a standard two-stage DEA model and a dynamic Slacks-Based Measure process will be carefully illustrated. In particular, the drawbacks faced by these latter techniques to consistently incorporate circularity into their optimization structures will be demonstrated both formally and numerically. The malleability of the current approach and its capacity to generate consistent identifiable categories among the regions evaluated within a circular production setting will be studied in detail. The analysis performed demonstrates significant structural differences in production capacity and efficiency across regions, with the inefficient ones displaying a considerable subpar use of resources through their production processes. The prevalence of inefficiency in several northern regions is partially compensated through their treatment and reutilization of water. However, this is not the case for the southern ones, which face stricter constraints and more inefficient production processes.

Removal of the ionic contaminant tellurite is essential in wastewater reclamation due to its potential threat to human health and difficulty of elimination. Herein, a rational design of separation membranes with synergistic physical and chemical effects to enhance separation efficiency with almost complete compensation for the loss of water flux was proposed. Membranes for tellurium separation with high efficiency and enhanced water flux were prepared by surface modification on the MOF-based support layer forming a dense separation layer (TSNTCM). The membrane separation efficiency was enhanced by the introduction of NH2-MIL-125 in the support layer, while the water flux was improved by its nano water channels. The abundant hydroxyl and anionic groups in the structure of the polymer monomer sodium lignosulfonate not only endowed the separation layer with chemical interaction (hydroxyl substitution), but also made the membrane surface highly negatively charged and improved the physical interaction. TSNTCM showed excellent tellurium separation efficiency (>95%) over a wide concentration range and achieved the highest rejection (99.16%) at pH = 6. Besides, the rejection of tellurium by TSNTCM was above 90% in the presence of common coexisting ions, but decreased in the presence of selenite, which may be due to the similar structure and properties of selenite and tellurite. Moreover, TSNTCM demonstrated satisfactory reusability and anti-fouling properties.

The influence of magnetic Maifanite on polystyrene removal from water was investigated under a magnetic field action time, solution pH, magnetic carrier dosage, and polystyrene concentration, using a developed rotating magnetic field generator. Additionally, the polystyrene removal mechanism by the rotating magnetic field was revealed based on characterization and process simulation. The results showed that Maifanite can increase the number of surface adsorption sites and improve the adsorption performance after high temperature and acid impregnated modification. Specifically, the surface morphology of the modified Maifanite exhibited skirted stripes and a multilayered pore structure. And the specific surface area increased from 3.26 to 20.83 m2/g. The removal process is based on chemical adsorption, supplemented by physical adsorption. The magnetic carrier is tightly wrapped around the polystyrene surface by π bonds between the metal and hydroxy groups, ensuring agglomeration strength. Additionally, the rotating magnetic field generator designed can provide a rotating dynamic magnetic field, and the magnetic particles in the mixed system present a multi-directional helical motion trajectory, thus the walking displacement increases and the capture time decreases. And the probability of collision with non-magnetic particles and the formation of magnetic agglomerates are greatly increased.

Furthermore, the effects of adsorbent dosage, interfering ions, real water samples, and the regenerability of the adsorbent were investigated. The high adsorption quantity of the adsorbent is attributed to the π–π interactions, hydrogen bonding, and coordination between NMF/TT-90 and antibiotic molecules, as well as the possible defect effects during the composite formation process.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.140290";"Heterogeneity in shadow prices of water pollutants: A study of the seafood processing industry in Vietnam ";" Water pollution poses a critical challenge, especially in fast-growing regions, with profound implications for human well-being. Marginal abatement cost (MAC) estimation is crucial for designing efficient water pollution control policies. This study applied the directional distance function to estimate MACs for three water pollutants (Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Chemical Oxygen Demand, and Total Suspended Solids) within Vietnam's seafood processing industry. Additionally, the paper conducted a regression analysis to investigate the determinants of these MACs, utilizing primary data from 116 seafood processing plants in the Mekong River Delta. The median MACs for Biochemical Oxygen Demand, Chemical Oxygen Demand, and Total Suspended Solids were 2451 US$/ton, 3983 US$/ton, and 5519 US$/ton, respectively. The results revealed substantial MAC heterogeneity. Capital-intensive firms, less labor-intensive entities, those with a more complex ownership structure, entities not situated along the seashore or riverside, export-oriented firms, and those demonstrating higher compliance exhibited consistently lower MACs for the three water pollutants. These findings challenge the efficiency of uniform standards or environmental fees in controlling pollution, suggesting that a tradable permit system could offer a more cost-saving alternative.
