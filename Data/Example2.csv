To sustain the supply of the elements and contribute to its circularity, LIB recycling is one of the justified routes. Although hydrometallurgy is considered as the most common process in battery recycling, improvements are still required to make the recycling process cleaner by reducing the steps and minimizing the chemical use. To achieve this goal, co-precipitation method is proposed to produce cathode active metals (CAM) of Li, Ni, Mn and Co from the leach solution. As battery chemistry is evolving fast, in near future, the dominant LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 (LNMC 111) type will be replaced by other types with different NMC ratios. Hence, in this study, co-precipitation was tested to recover Li, Ni, Mn and Co from various leachates with different metal compositions, simulating leachates from different battery chemistries. A hydrometallurgy flowsheet comprising four precipitation steps for metal recoveries from leach solutions was developed. In the first stage, aluminium was removed as Al(OH)3 by increasing the pH of the leachate to 5.5. Cu was removed in the next stage as sulfide by adding sodium sulfide to the supernatant obtained in the first stage. In the third stage, Ni, Mn and Co were co-precipitated as hydroxide precursor by increasing pH of supernatant to 11. The results showed that >95% of Ni, >83% Co, and >42% of Mn could be precipitated from the leaching liquor. Finally, Li is recovered from the supernatant as carbonate precipitate by adding sodium carbonate. Ni,Mn,Co(OH)2 precursor was finally mixed with Li2CO3 precipitated and calcined to resynthesize CAM showing the potential of this process to close the loop of recycling.";"2023-12-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623035011";"13";"Batteries"

To improve the Li recovery, high-pressure acid leaching using H2SO4 for Li preferential liberation and the subsequent purification were systematically investigated. Experimental results showed that 97.6% of Li was preferentially leached with about 2% of Ni, Co, and Mn co-leached, and a leaching solution with a Li+ concentration of 21.46 g/L was obtained. Further characterization indicated that most of Li was first liberated and exchanged by the proton (H+), then the high reaction temperature induced the hydrolysis of the co-leached Ni2+, Co2+, and Mn2+ and generated extra H+ prompted a deeper liberation of Li from the undissolved NCM structures. Additionally, the high-purity Li2CO3 was achieved via a synergistic extraction by D2EHPA and 4PC for the deep removal and recovery of co-leached Ni/Co/Mn followed by carbonation. Compared with the traditional end-Li-recovery method, the proposed method possesses the advantages of a short Li extraction process, high recovery, and low cost. Moreover, the preferential leaching of Li provided an opportunity for a novel hydrometallurgical process to recover spent lithium-ion batteries that consists of Li preliminary leaching, Ni–Co–Mn material leaching, precipitation of Fe/Al, and selective extraction of F, Ni, Co, and Mn was not separated that shorten the flowsheet in this process, dramatically reduced reagent consumption and wastewater generation.

However, the current low efficiency and inadequate profitability of these two technologies, especially concerning green methanol production, pose challenges for their industrial implementation. One solution is to integrate these two technologies to augment the material and energy utilization efficiency through dynamic operational coordination and multi-energy production. This study systematically investigates the synergies of integrating CO2 energy storage (CES) and PtMe for combined heating, power, and methanol generation, aiming to enhance system's efficiency and economic viability. In this context, a novel hybrid energy-driven polygeneration system (CES-PtMe) is developed, featuring a highly integrated methanol production process and a newly proposed CES configuration with heating input and output capabilities. Detailed system simulations assess its performance under steady state, while nonlinear programming models are formulated for optimal storage sizing and energy scheduling considering fluctuating renewable energy. Various scenarios are set to examine the techno-economic potential of the CES-PtMe system, using renewable data from Gansu, China as a case study. The results indicate that the system can achieve a high efficiency of nearly 80% with a renewable penetration exceeding 77%. By incorporating optimal energy scheduling throughout the year, the system shows economic viability in the context of the current fossil energy market. While it has a limited ability to meet user energy demands, the proposed system retains economic benefits compared to standalone technologies.

However, due to limited stock of primary sources of vanadium within the earth's crust, the sourcing of vanadium pentoxide for potential VRFB installations will warrant a steep price increment for vanadium commodity. To tackle this challenge, the present study focusses on powering a VRFB using secondary sources such as the spent vanadium catalyst. In this work, a novel and sustainable extraction technique is designed to extract vanadium from spent vanadium catalyst retired from sulfuric acid plants. The extracted vanadium precursors are pure phase V2O4 and V2O3 as confirmed by XRD and ICP-MS analysis. Furthermore, unlike V2O5, these can be directly used to synthesize the positive and negative VRFB electrolytes without any further treatment. Moreover, the electrolyte prepared from the extracted vanadium precursors deliver charge-discharge profiles and discharge capacity (Ah/L) fade trend similar to the commercial vanadium electrolytes for more than 300 cycles in a single-cell VRFB at 80 mA/cm2. Finally, an economic analysis model is developed for a 10 kW/120 kWh VRFB installation which suggests that the cost of synthesizing vanadium electrolyte using spent vanadium catalyst is 2.73 $/L. Moreover, the cost of extraction of V2O4 and V2O3 is 20.52 $/kg and 22.78 $/kg, respectively, which is significantly less than the commercial prices.

To gain a deeper understanding of parasitic GERs in VRFBs, a transient multidimensional multiphysics VRFB model was developed by coupling the transport of multiphase species and electrochemical reactions. First, it was predicted that the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) occurs during the whole charge-discharge process due to the negative activation overpotential of the HER whereas the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) occurs only at the end of the charging process. Second, the charging current has a strong effect on the HER in the region near the bipolar plate. Third, it was found that the HER increases almost seven times (from 163.3 A m−3 to 1167.1 A m−3) when the operating temperature increases from 298.15 K to 313.15 K. The temperature has a more significant effect on the activation overpotential of OER than that of HER. Furthermore, the increasing HER with the increasing SOC results in an SOC imbalance of 0.54% after 10 charge-discharge cycles, which accounts for 11% of the overall capacity loss.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139554";"A novel method for constructing the relationships between state of charge and open-circuit voltage of lithium-ion battery under different temperatures with reduced test time ";" The equivalent circuit models (ECMs) have been extensively applied to estimate the state-of-charge (SOC) for lithium-ion batteries. And it is significant for ECMs to establish the relationship between the open-circuit voltage (OCV) and SOC. The accurate relationship is usually obtained from the incremental OCV (IO) test, which is time-consuming for each OCV test point. To overcome this shortcoming, a novel method for obtaining the relationship is proposed to save test time. Firstly, five OCV test points of the IO tests are used under different temperatures, and the OCV change trend along the SOC is acquired from the low-current OCV test at room temperature, from which the feature points are extracted by the Douglas-Peucker algorithm to express the OCV change trends. Finally, the OCV test points are connected by moving feature points twice to construct the SOC-OCV curves under different temperatures with fewer OCV test points. The SOC estimations of two different lithium-ion batteries are achieved based on the second-order RC ECM using the adaptive extended Kalman filter. The results indicate that the SOC estimations are more accurate in a wide temperature range compared to the traditional method while the time for OCV tests is reduced by at least 50%.

However, high scrap rates represent a key challenge for the production of lithium-ion batteries, especially for electrode manufacturing. The recycling of cathode production scraps that occur as intermediate products in electrode manufacturing offers a good possibility to reuse valuable battery active materials and close the material cycle within the production line. In this work we develop a novel method based on electromagnetic induction to separate cathode coating and aluminum foil. A cathode coil rejected from production was cut into sheets which were inductively heated to 300, 400 and 550 °C. The thermally pre-treated sheets were stressed in a cutting mill. With this method the coating could be separated from the foil up to 99.12 %. The aluminum impurities in the recycled fine powder fraction could be kept at a low level of 0.27 wt.-% at maximum. Agglomerates in the powder fraction could be significantly reduced through the thermal pre-treatment. This work shows the feasibility of induction heating as an energy-efficient and flexible thermal pre-treatment for the recycling of roll-to-roll cathode materials.

This work proposes a facile and clean process for recovering of valuable metals based on microwave-assisted hydrogen reduction of spent cathode materials followed by grind-leaching and magnetic separation. After hydrogen reduction, the spent cathode material was transformed into water-soluble LiOH, Ni–Co alloy and MnO, wherein LiOH was preferentially dissolved by grind-leaching, while Ni–Co alloy was recycled by magnetic separation. Compared with the traditional carbothermal reduction, lithium was converted into LiOH instead of Li2CO3, and the Li leaching efficiency was significantly improved. Ni–Co alloy can be separated with MnO via simple magnetic separation without acid leaching. Effects of roasting (roasting temperature and time) and grind-leaching (grinding time and liquid-to-solid ratio) parameters on the recoveries of Li, Ni, Co and Mn were investigated. Under the conditions of roasting temperature of 973 K, roasting time of 60 min, grinding time of 30 min and liquid-to-solid ratio of 5 mL/g, the grind-leaching efficiency of Li was 98.17%. Ni and Co were enriched in the magnetic material with recoveries of 99.71% and 98.52%, respectively. Moreover, the coupling mechanism between Li dissolution and particle dissociation during the grind-leaching process was revealed.

The policy consistency from up to down in a big country lays a solid foundation for sustainable recycling. However, quantitative comparison or evaluation of power batteries recycling policies (PBRPs) from various levels of government is insufficient in the existing literature. In this paper, text mining technology and the Policy Modelling Consistency Index (PMC-Index) model are used to evaluate the longitudinal and horizontal consistency level of China's 13 central PBRPs as well as 25 local PBRPs from 2016 to 2022. The findings demonstrated that: (1) Longitudinally, the local governments present a high consistency level with the central government in the objective and content of PBRPs via comparison analysis of high-frequency words, which embodies the local governments firmly advocating the national strategy for retired battery recycling. (2) Horizontally, the number of central PBRPs with excellent and good consistency is five and seven, respectively, while the number of local PBRPs with excellent and good consistency is six and seven, respectively. One central and twelve local PBRPs are of acceptable consistency, indicating significant disparity in local governments' policymaking ability. (3)The drawbacks of those acceptable policies attribute to the policy tendency of traceability management, policy timeliness, policy content in terms of incentives and business recycling model. Finally, management implications were summarized to optimize China's PBRPs system and PBR performance based on the empirical result, an overview of PBRPs and recycling practices in developed countries.

The methodology aims at identifying those national provisions which do not comply with the EU legislation. Consequently, long and onerous infringement procedures may ultimately limit the development of RECs. Moreover, the proposed methodology quantifies the economic value of national policies concerning the participation of storage assets in RECs. Three policy options are compared against the case without flexible assets. To do so, ad-hoc mixed-integer linear programming optimization problems are developed. The assessment is based on the formulation of three key performance indicators, concerning the revenues and costs of the REC. The main data sources in the work are the actual Italian Wholesale Market prices and the price incentives introduced by relevant Italian authorities to support the operation of the RECs. Results indicate an incorrect transposition of the fundamental rights of the EU law. These concern a significant alteration of the membership criteria for prospective RECs and the introduction of external third-parties, which may bypass fundamental requirements set out in the EU law. Numerical results call for a profound revision of the policy options for battery storage in RECs since the envisaged configurations introduce structural limits to the REC's revenues This work can support researchers and policy makers at both national and EU-level in developing policy options and techno-economic measures that foster the development of new RECs.";"2023-11-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623030950";"6";"Batteries"

Forecasting LIB prices has received significant attention due to the tightening of raw material markets. Additionally, the implementation of carbon pricing policies has highlighted the need to incorporate the carbon footprint of LIBs in price evaluation. This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the carbon footprint, pricing trajectories, and forthcoming carbon pricing ramifications associated with LIBs. Firstly, the findings derived from the life-cycle carbon footprint assessment indicate that the global production volume-weighted average carbon footprint of EV battery packs spans 49.2–81.1 kgCO2eq/kWh, depending on the chosen end-of-life treatment. Strategic end-of-life selections, aligned with battery chemical composition, can diminish the carbon footprint by up to 46% relative to improper disposal methods. Notably, direct cathode recycling of NCA and NMC622 batteries exhibits superior environmental performance. Secondly, techno-economic analysis predicts that the mean price of EV battery packs with diverse chemical compositions will decline to $75.1/kWh by 2030, factoring in the compound annual growth rate of critical raw material prices over the past decade. LFP batteries emerge as the top economic performers. Lastly, the results reveal that monetizing a battery's carbon footprint may offset battery price reductions through learning effects. This underscores the imperative of effective recycling for curtailing the carbon footprint and ensuring the enduring economic and environmental competitiveness of LIBs.

Based on the same service level, this study conducted a techno-economic comparison of charging modes for battery heavy-duty vehicles in short-haul delivery, covering the broadest range of charging modes, including slow, fast (150 kW), fast (350 kW), swap, and overhead catenary. The techno-economic performance is obtained by a model composed of five evaluation indicators, in which the ratio of service capacity to cost and the average financial net present value are specific. The factors influencing the techno-economic performance of charging modes are further explored based on case analysis. Results show that the charging modes of slow, fast (150 kW), fast (350 kW), swap, and overhead catenary are not profitable under the corresponding facility utilisation rates of 40%, 20%, 20%, 30%, and 70%, or under operating years of 5, 3, 2, 4, and 12 years. Fast charging, at both 150 and 350 kW, has a better advantage in profitability based on the highest average financial net present value. Swap charging is best regarding energy supplement efficiency, but it is not profitable when the battery swapping price is less than 0.8 CNY/kWh.

Through a structural equation model, this study explored the effects of recycling channels (online and offline), policy incentives, and environmental awareness on young consumers' intention and behavior towards formal power battery recycling (PBR). Our findings reveal the following: (1) There is a significant difference in the distribution of latent variable scores, with an average score ranging between 2.85 and 4.87, with the score for perceived convenience being the lowest. (2) Both online and offline recycling channels improve young consumers' perceived convenience, with a greater effect from offline recycling channels. Perceived convenience mediates the relationship between offline recycling and formal recycling intention. Policy incentives and environmental awareness also significantly increase consumers' intention to formal PBR.

In contrast, online recycling channels have a significant positive effect on the perceived convenience of female consumers. Offline recycling channels have a significant positive effect on the perceived convenience of consumers below the age of 30. Online recycling channels significantly affect the perceived convenience of low-income consumers (≤200,000 yuan), while the effect on high-income groups is insignificant.

Electric vehicles (EVs) are booming worldwide, especially in China. Even if EVs' cost decreases and performances make significant progress, the convenience and deployment problem of charging infrastructure is still the key restriction for large-scale adoption. Therefore, this study proposes a real-EV-data-based model with the aim of optimal charging infrastructure deployment oriented to charging convenience and charging demand.

Nondestructive and destructive methods were employed to study battery degradation and electrode changes. The results indicate that the surface changes of the negative electrode in parts 1 and 2 are due to solid electrolyte interphase growth and lithium plating, respectively. Battery aging at 50 °C for 18,650-type LIB is inhomogeneous. Local lithium plating is consumed during cycling. The aging of the battery cycled at −10 °C after 50 °C is slower compared to those cycled at constant high and low temperatures. Lithium plating occurs when plated lithium already exists. Battery aging for 18,650-type batteries is path dependent because the electrode changes for batteries cycled at low temperatures after high temperatures are similar to those for batteries cycled at high temperatures. The battery aging in this study was mainly caused by lithium plating in part 2 of the negative electrode. The aging of the 18,650-type battery is governed by Cannikin's law.

To address this issue, this study proposes a comprehensive framework for SAEV system design and optimization in accordance with the dynamic nature of battery degradation under varying load conditions. The framework incorporates a semi-empirical method, which is a predictive approach capable of estimating capacity changes based on factors such as temperature, C-rate, cycle number, and depth of discharge (DOD) for each cycle.

However, the intermittent nature of these sources means that their availability does not always correlate with load fluctuations. Hence, to solve the unpredictability concerns associated with solar and wind energy sources, they may be integrated with storage technologies and conventional energy sources (diesel generators) in a hybrid energy system (HES) to continuously supply the load demand.

Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs), a valuable supplement to lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), have attracted global attention due to their low price and rich raw materials. However, few studies have compared and evaluated the environmental indicators of SIBs and LIBs. Here, the carbon emissions and various environmental indicators of five LIBs and six SIBs at the manufacturing stage are calculated and compared utilizing the life-cycle assessment method in various scenarios. Our findings indicate that: (1) The most environmental indicators of SIBs are generally lower than those of LIBs, and the carbon emissions of the two types of battery demonstrate different distributions. (2) The carbon emission from the production of cathode material for LIBs accounts for the highest proportion of total carbon emission during battery production (over 50%), and that for SIBs exhibit diversity. (3) Carbon emissions are intensely associated with the electricity mix. The cleaner the electricity mix, the lower the carbon emissions of the battery production, and the more significant the gap between SIBs and LIBs. (4) As the proportion of renewable energy generation in China's future electricity mix continuously escalates, a progressive decline appears in carbon emissions, and the advantages of SIBs in carbon emissions have a prominent growth during battery production. This study provides a valuable reference for reducing the environmental impacts during the manufacturing stage of SIBs and LIBs in different material systems.

Firstly, taking charge accumulation corresponding to specific voltage window as input, we build a data-driven RCC estimation model to online monitor each cell's RCC at specific voltage. Afterwards, considering the initial cell inconsistences, each cell's current RCC before equalization is further computed based on the estimated RCC and the subsequently measured charge accumulation. Finally, a parallel global search algorithm named particle swarm optimization is adopted to search the optimal combination of in-pack cells' equalization current considering equalization time and energy loss simultaneously. The verification results based on the Oxford battery degradation dataset demonstrate that the established data-driven model can realize accurate RCC estimation and all in-pack cells' totally charged capacity can roughly approach their maximum capacity at the end of CC charging stage using the proposed equalization strategy. Meanwhile, the maximum cell voltage difference and maximum cell SOC difference can be limited below 0.01V and 0.02, respectively. Moreover, by extending the charging time by only about 4min, the developed equalization strategy can further increase battery pack capacity by about 10%.

Herein, an efficient and comprehensive recycling method for spent LiNi0.5Mn0.3Co0.2O2 cathode material (NMC 532), one of the most important materials for electric vehicles and grid storage applications, is developed based on ammonium sulfate low-temperature molten salt (LTMS) reduction with oxygen evolution, and the feasibility of the strategy is systematically investigated. The results demonstrate that (NH4)2SO4 LTMS can effectively realize the sulfate conversion of spent NMC 532, in which the sulfate conversion rates of Li, Ni, Mn, and Co all reach more than 90%. Through mechanism analysis, it is found that the induced superoxide ion (O2 ·-) and H+ are the keys to the reduction of transition metal oxides in LTMS. Meanwhile, O2 ·-, as a single electron reducing agent in the intermediate state, can be used to explain the reduction behavior of transition metal oxides in other ammonium salts, mineral acids, and H-containing salts in molten. Based on (NH4)2SO4 LTMS reduction, water leaching, thermodynamic analysis of coprecipitation, and a series of precipitation and separation experiments, this study provides an effective strategy for recycling spent cathode materials, which can realize the combination of spent material recycling and electrode material regeneration.

While this holds true in most cases, the overall economic costs and benefits of this architecture are either overlooked or incomplete in previous research works. This paper introduces a life cycle cost optimization model for cost-effective upgrade of battery-alone energy storage systems (BESS) into battery-SC HESS. The case study in this paper shows that the presence of SC can result in up to 1.95% reduction in LCC over the remaining five years of the plant’s lifespan. As side benefits, 5.2% decrease in energy consumption and CO2 equivalent emissions associated to the manufacturing and operation of the HESS components. The proposed model can therefore inform about the relevance of a BESS retrofit in both brownfield and greenfield projects.

However, the environmental impacts of BEVs remain a critical concern. This paper investigates the circular business model (CBM) of leasing batteries for BEVs and compares its economic and environmental impacts with the linear model of selling and buying batteries. A comprehensive approach combining a battery fleet model, net present value (NPV) analysis, and cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) is employed. By considering diverse driving profiles instead of the single “average” profile used in previous studies, the battery fleet model provides a more accurate representation of reality. The findings reveal that while leasing batteries can be as profitable as selling them, companies that lease may require higher revenues and tax contributions to obtain a comparable NPV. To generate additional income, companies may need to charge fees that do not always benefit customers. Notably, battery purchasing remains the most cost-effective option for users driving over 10,000 km/year. The LCA results indicate that the environmental benefits of leasing batteries over selling them are marginal. Leasing offers advantages such as user flexibility, and it encourages battery repair, repurposing, and recycling; however, there is insufficient evidence to support the cost-effectiveness of leasing or significant environmental improvements over traditional buying and selling models. The findings may be relevant for other business models targeting a substantial user base in the BEV domain, such as battery-as-a-service (BaaS) programs and battery swapping.";"2023-10-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623025143";"21";"Batteries"

In Malaysia, the biggest contributors to spent LIBs are consumer electronics (CEs), which if not properly managed, can jeopardize both the environment and human health. Additionally, the supply of raw materials for LIBs are limited. The risks to the supply chain for LIBs can be mitigated through recycling and reuse, which calls for the need of a robust circular economy model. Currently, there is a lack of local research on spent LIBs and to address this gap, the present study surveyed the actions and willingness of the public towards the disposal, collection, and recycling of LIBs, through the scope of CEs, as electric vehicles (EVs) currently does not dominate the LIB market in Malaysia. A national online survey via convenient sampling was carried out. It was found that a majority of respondents had never sent spent LIBs for recycling while 38.2% of the respondents disposed LIBs directly into the trash bin. The survey also determined that a huge number of the respondents were willing to recycle but lack knowledge and information on the disposal and recycling channels. On the other hand, 0.5% of the respondents was not motivated to recycle LIBs. Following that, relevant recommendations were set forth, revolving around three major categories – (1) laws, policies, and regulations, (2) infrastructures and technologies, and (3) education and awareness.

This transition is a complex process that depends on many factors, especially technologies and business models. This process started many years ago, but it is still associated with a high uncertainty level. With regards to powertrain technologies, it is not clear which technology will be dominant in the future. Will it be the Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) or the hydrogen-based Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV) that will achieve a higher level of diffusion? Regarding business models, despite extensive research, the business models that will support the automotive transition are far from clear. Therefore, this research, based on a two-stage interview study, addresses both perspectives: technology and business model. Three possible options for powertrain technologies are identified: (i) coexistence of BEVs and FCEVs, (ii) BEVs, but conditional introduction of FCEVs, and (iii) BEVs only without FCEVs. In addition, the results show that business model innovation in the automotive industry can be driven by many aspects such as management vision, market, competition, future trends, battery, charging technology and infrastructure, as well as digital technologies and services. By combining the powertrain technology and business model dimensions, four future scenarios for the automotive transition are proposed: simply BEV, technology diversification, service-oriented BEV production, and maximum versatility. An expert evaluation allows the scenarios to be prioritized according to their likelihood of occurrence. The results show that the service-based BEV-scenario is the most likely one. Nevertheless, the differences between most and least likely scenarios are not large enough to disclose a clear trend, confirming the diffuse situation in the industry.

However, there have been few studies that have investigated the influence of government policy on the selection of licensing strategies for energy storage technologies by renewable electricity suppliers. Consequently, we constructed a game model involving two competing renewable electricity suppliers, the grid company, and the government. One of them is a technologically advanced electricity supplier, and the other is a technologically backward one. The model considers government subsidies and compares three licensing strategies: technology monopolies (TM), unit-production authorization (UA), and fixed-fee authorization (FA). Based on numerical analysis, this paper compares wholesale electricity prices, grid orders and grid and government profits under different licensing strategies. Next, the choice of the optimal licensing strategy among electricity suppliers and the preferences of the grid and the government for different licensing strategies are analyzed. The results show that wholesale electricity prices increase and grid orders decrease under the UA strategy compared to the TM strategy, while the opposite is true under the FA strategy. The FA strategy is preferred between electricity suppliers when the cost of generation from technologically advanced suppliers exceeds twice the cost of generation from technologically inferior suppliers. Otherwise, the UA strategy is more appropriate. Moreover, the grid and government preferred the FA strategy to the TM or UA strategy, with profits rising 89% and 26% for the grid and government respectively under this strategy. Lastly, the grid is more profitable under the UA strategy than under the TM strategy only if the level of electricity reliability and grid cost are higher.

Because of the high demand for energy and critical metals for LIB production, it is necessary to quantify the associated resource consumption intensity from multiple perspectives. In the present study, the exergy derived from the second law of thermodynamics was applied to assess the abiotic resource depletion associated with lithium nickel cobalt manganate (NCM) battery production, including NCM111, NCM523, NCM622, and NCM811. For comparability of results, the functional unit was defined as 1 kWh NCM power pack. The results showed that the cumulative exergy demand (CExD) value of the NCM523 pack production is 2857.56 MJ/kWh, with the cathode material manufacturing process accounting for 56.77% because of the significant contribution of CoSO4. The CExD of battery production can be effectively reduced by reducing cobalt use and adding a solvent recovery device. The supply stage of upstream raw and auxiliary materials is the key to CExD reduction. The comparison results indicated a significant reduction in the CExD of Ni-rich NCM batteries due to improvement in energy density and reduction in cobalt demand. In addition, the comparison of abiotic resource depletion characterization results and method characteristics among the CExD, ReCiPe, and CML-IA methods showed that using CExD has clear advantages with regard to objectivity and long-term stability in the evaluation of rapidly innovated battery products.

However, when the user's travel plans are uncertain, the EV may end up charging before the planned time, leaving the user with an insufficient power supply. This can occur because the control program chooses to charge the EV during periods of low electricity prices to reduce user costs. To address this issue, a new strategy for charging pricing based on service-quality is proposed to help users deal with the uncertainty of travel plans and promote user participation in demand response. In this paper, the proposed charging pricing of EVs consists of three parts. Firstly, the model of charging packages with different service qualities is designed for users. The differences in charging packages are reflected in the percentage of power supply and price within each time slot. Charging packages provide users with at least a certain amount of power in each time slot, allowing them to better cope with the uncertainty of their travel plans. Secondly, a subscription model for charging packages is built to match the user's travel plans. Finally, the pricing model of the charging package is established, representing the master-slave game between the load aggregator and the user. The model is linearized by the KKT condition. The results show that the proposed strategy helps users cope with the uncertainty of their travel plans, reducing charging cost for users by 16.39% while increasing revenue for the load aggregator by 14.8%.

Lithium battery is an efficient energy storage and conversion system, and its use can effectively reduce the use of fossil fuels. However, its extremely sensitive temperature characteristics seriously limit its performance. Therefore, it is of great significance to design an efficient battery cooling system to protect the performance of lithium batteries. In this paper, a novel serpentine mini-channel cooling management system for lithium battery is studied with experiment research and numerical simulation. The simulation results and experimental data are in good agreement. The difference between the two results is roughly within 1 K. The maximum battery temperature increases with the increase of the discharge current. The cooling system has high efficiency and made battery temperature drop rapidly. When the Reynolds number is 200, the maximum battery temperature decreases from 327.4 K to 306.9 K at 30 A discharge current, from 313.5 K to 300.4 K at 15 A discharge current, and from 306.1 K to 298.7 K at 7.5 A discharge current. The maximum battery temperature drops rapidly when the Reynolds number ranges from 0 to 40 and decreases slowly from 40 to 200. Whereas, the Reynolds number has little effect on the battery temperature for Re is over 200. The low inlet temperature and high aspect ratio are beneficial for heat dissipation.

Due to the uneven heat generation, an overheating region appears along the battery center to positive tab, especially at high discharge rates.

The high cost, intensified carbon density and performance ageing of electrochemical batteries prevent its sustainable applications. Many studies have explored the battery circular economy based on reusing retired EV batteries with economic and environmental competitiveness. However, few studies combine battery circular economy with E-mobility-based interactive renewable energy sharing network for sustainability, together with comprehensive considerations on dynamic battery performance and degradation. In this study, a building-vehicle energy interaction model and a battery circular economy model were developed to simulate the process of reusing retired EV batteries. Considering the inconsistency in the carbon intensity of battery operation, manufacturing and recycling phases, a lifecycle battery carbon intensity criterion is proposed to quantify the lifetime carbon of batteries, and assess the decarbonisation capability of different renewable sources, battery reusing and V2B/B2V interaction, respectively. Results show that reusing retired batteries from EVs to buildings can improve the demand coverage ratio (DCR) from 0.480 to 0.504 and the renewable penetration ratio (RPR) from 0.502 to 0.531, respectively. Furthermore, the battery carbon intensity cannot be offset unless both renewables and reused batteries are integrated. The case study demonstrates the decrease of battery carbon intensity from 1284.57 kg CO2,e/kWh to −720.79 kg CO2,e/kWh with renewable and reused batteries. Research results can provide innovative battery circular economy frameworks for electrification transformation, decarbonisation and sustainable development.

The multi-objective modelling of energy management in smart buildings with the presence of electric vehicles is the main topic of this paper, which also takes risk and economic considerations into account. To make the problem more realistic, various practical and nonlinear constraints are taken into account, such as production limits, flexible loads, and cost-risk limitations and indicators. Since solving this problem with classical methods is challenging and prone to suboptimal solutions, a developed whale optimization algorithm is suggested. In the proposed developed approach, efforts are made to enhance its capabilities and prevent it from converging to local points using local search. Finally, the proposed method and model are discussed and examined under different scenarios. The results demonstrate that when consumers have a positive attitude towards energy consumption, the net cost significantly decreases compared to a conservative attitude. The battery is used during times of favourable prices when users perceive more solar energy availability. Moreover, when users adopt different price risk indicators, these indicators have varying effects on the electricity purchasing strategy of the user.

In light of this, this paper proposes a stochastic two-stage bi-level model for coordinating EVs in a distribution network with charging stations under alternating current optimal power flow (ACOPF) constraints. The scheduling problem is considered to independently minimize the costs of the distribution system operator (DSO) and EVs parked at different charging stations located at various buses of the network. In the proposed model, the DSO as the leader, and all EVs as independent followers, are individual entities who try to follow their priorities and objectives. The amount and price of exchanged power between the DSO and EVs are optimally determined in the proposed model. The proposed bi-level model has been converted to a single-level model using the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) conditions. Afterwards, the Big M method is used to convert the non-linear equations that appear due to utilizing the KKT approach. The scenario-based uncertainty modeling is used to model the uncertainty in input data such as day-ahead and real-time market prices, EVs’ initial state of charge (SOC), and arrival/departure time.

The layout of battery swapping facilities and scheduling management can be carried out by accurately analyzing the high-resolution spatial-temporal distribution of battery swapping demand for EMV. This study establishes a prediction model framework for battery swapping demand of EMV using Monte Carlo simulation based on travel chains considering multi-source information interaction and behavior decision. Using real residential travel survey data of Nanning City, China and an empirical analysis with the city as a case study, the results show that the prediction framework proposed in this study is reliable. The temporal distribution of EMV battery swapping demand is closely related to the spatial distribution of travel. In addition, the demand characteristics of both centralized and decentralized battery swapping stations are evaluated separately. The peak intensity of the centralized mode is 18% greater than that of the decentralized mode when the battery swapping penetration is 35%. When the battery swapping penetration rate is low, decentralized mode can meet the peak swapping demand, and as the penetration rate increases, the effect of centralized mode is reflected. Finally, the total swapping path time considering multi-source information interaction and behavior decision is reduced by 7.8%.

The illegal charging behavior of EMV users has become a significant cause of EMV fire accidents. However, the current literature lacks attention towards EMV illegal charging behavior. This study employed the extended theory of planned behavior and structural equation modeling approach to identify the driving factors of illegal charging behavior among Chinese EMV users. An empirical study was conducted on 402 EMV users in Nanjing, China, analyzing the relationship between latent variables and testing the moderating effects of control variables, such as gender, through a multi-group analysis. The results revealed that the structural model had a good fit and explanatory power and its predictive validity accounts for about 55% of the variance in adoption intention. Subjective norm was the most important factor driving users' intention to adopt illegal charging behavior, and attitude and perceived behavioral control also present significant positive effects on the intention to adopt illegal charging behavior. Meanwhile, charging environment was significantly and positively related to risk perception, while there was no significant effect on attitude. Risk perception positively influenced attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control. Furthermore, gender, education, and riding frequency moderate the intention of EMV users to engage in illegal charging behavior, whereas age and riding distance do not have a significant moderating effect.

It is noteworthy that government intervention plays an essential role in promoting power battery recycling.

This paper constructs a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC) consisting of a single battery manufacturer, vehicle manufacturer, and third-party recycler under seven recycling models. The government intervenes in the CLSC through subsidy, deposit-refund, and reward-penalty policies to increase the recycling rate and supply chain profits. We compare these policies' social welfare including economic benefits, environmental benefits, consumer surplus, and government surplus. Results show that: (1) Subsidy policy has prominent performance in economic profits and consumer surplus. And the remaining capacity-based subsidy policy is better than the fixed subsidy policy.

The mentioned phenomenon will intensify by high WP penetration into the power system. In addition, incorporating plugged-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) into the power system along with the WP intermittent will increase the vagueness rating of the problem. Due to the expansion and development of battery energy storage (BES), the possibility of power shortage compensating and accumulating additional power produced by wind farms (WFs) has been engendered. Providing a stochastic scenario-based structure with different correlation levels can increase the robustness of the model. Here, a two-stage model has been proposed to overcome such a high-dimensioned problem. The first stage determined the scheduled power output of thermal generators (TGs) as the unit commitment (UC) problem to minimize operational costs. Next, by reckoning the supplementary constraints, the scheduled WP, which is re-optimized, will be obtained. The second stage has employed to detect the BES capacity.

What follows is that we will face one of the biggest challenges: how to accurately predict the energy consumption (EC) of electric vehicles to alleviate the ‘range anxiety’ problem. To address this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid approach using short-trip segment division (S-TSD) algorithm and deep neural network (DNN) for predicting the energy consumption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) by using real-world driving datasets. In this study, we aim to accurately predict energy consumption at the short-trip level, so we propose a novel S-TSD algorithm to divide the driving process of BEVs into several driving segments and conduct feature extraction for each segment. Then, using the extracted features, we develop a series of DNN models with varying hidden layers to investigate the respective performance for EC predictions. The results show that the optimal number of hidden layers is identified as 5, and the neuron structure for each hidden layer is determined as 13 × 256 , 256 × 512 , 512 × 256 , 256 × 128 , and 128 × 1 , respectively.

Despite being in their infancy, their high efficiency, compact design, and reduced electronics are widely established. However, we know little about their environmental performance. Here, we present this lab-scale technology's first detailed life cycle assessment, specifically of one using a perovskite/silicon tandem photoelectrode. We also compared the environmental performance of the integrated SFB with an established competitor: a photovoltaic panel using the same tandem, coupled with a lithium manganese oxide battery. We found that, on average, ∼59% of the environmental impacts are from the electrolytes, 23% from the structure, and 18% from the PV component of the SFB. Our results showed that by replacing the Teflon and polyether ether ketone materials used in the structure of this SFB, we could reduce ozone depletion and global warming potential impacts by 85% and 36% respectively. Extending the lifetime of the electrolytes can further improve this SFB's environmental performance.

However, most of extant approaches require complete charging and discharging profiles that rarely occurs in practical applications to extract health features matched by the cycling capacity. To address this limitation, this paper directly intercepted partial charging voltage segments from raw charging curves, evading complicated manual features extraction. A progressive training framework is proposed and integrated with the deep convolutional neural network to build the online capacity estimator. Three battery aging datasets involving 28 cells cyclic aging data are exploited for model training and validation. Thereinto, the source dataset and target dataset-1 are used to train the model parameters progressively, and the target dataset-2 is applied to validate model performance. Experimental results show that the deep convolutional neural network coupled with progressive training framework can significantly enhance the capacity estimation accuracy and reduce retraining time compared with the ordinary convolutional neural network. The comparison results of different machine learning algorithms demonstrate that the proposed method possesses high estimation precision with a maximum relative error of only 3.4% on the target dataset, which can be easily extended to different types of battery capacity estimation.

In the mechanochemical process, only ferric chloride was used as a grinding agent. Experimental results showed that more than 97 wt% of lithium in the cathode materials could be selectively recovered with a purity of 99.9% under optimal conditions (FeCl3:LiFePO4 mass ratio of 1.2:1, rotary speed of 600 rpm, and reaction time of 30 min). Mechanism analysis indicated the key point was that electrons were transferred to ferric chloride from LFP cathode material, and the LFP was oxidized to iron phosphate during mechanochemical activation, but the olivine structure of the cathode material remained unchanged. Therefore, lithium could be easily extracted from the olivine structure. In addition, the LiFe5O8 synthesized from spent LFP battery has good magnetic properties, in which the saturation magnetization (Ms) was 49.23 emu/g.

How to minimise the environmental impact in the recovery process has become a common and emergent concern. In this study, Life Cycle Assessment Model (LCA) was applied to analyse the entire life cycle of Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) batteries from the production, use, and recovery processes and compared the life cycle environmental impacts of different recovery technologies to determine the technology with the optimum overall environmental attributes. The critical process for reducing environmental impacts and the main contributing factors were identified by thoroughly evaluating the environmental impact of the recovery process and the reduction of the environmental impact in the production phase by using recycled products. The results show that the cascade utilisation technique has the optimum performance compared with the all-component physical method and hydrometallurgical recovery technology. The results also imply that the production phase has a relatively greater impact on the assessment results when the recovery phase is not considered, especially the use phase has no contribution to the ADP, while the production phase has a contribution of 97.8%. Through the comprehensive comparison of different recovery technologies for lithium iron phosphate batteries, it is found that the environmental impact of the recovery phase can be improved by prioritising cascade utilisation, increasing the recovery rate, reducing the resource and energy consumption and pollution discharge in the recovery process, increasing the variety of recycled battery materials, and choosing the recycled products that can substitute for more production steps.

Considering the uncertainty of EVs charging/discharging load on the spatio-temporal scale, this paper proposes an optimal scheduling strategy for EVs with spatio-temporal characteristics. The strategy integrates EVs into the microgrid, constructs the spatio-temporal distribution models of charging load and describes the uncertainty of electric vehicle owners’ (EVOs) charging behaviours by fuzzy theory. Considering the bounded rationality of EVOs, this paper takes the charging/discharging price of EVs as the decision variable, and the dynamic time-of-use price mechanism is used to guide EVOs to make charging/discharging decisions. Then, with the objective function of minimising the comprehensive operating cost (COC) and the peak-valley load difference (PVLD), an orderly charging/discharging scheduling model for EVs is established and the optimal scheduling strategy is given. Furthermore, the three scheduling scenarios are set up in the case study, and the maximum number of EVs to participate in scheduling is determined to be 4000.

However, due to the excessive use of chemicals during operation, issues associated with operating costs and pollution of disposed wastewater hinder large-scale application. The disposed wastewater contains highly concentrated ions that can be reutilized via electro-electrodialysis (EED). In addition, regenerated base can be utilized as a CO2 absorbent, which produces soda ash that can be directly utilized for metal precipitation in the recycling process. Thus, this paper proposes a novel integrated system of wastewater EED and CO2 capture for sustainable LIB recycling. This system includes selective metal recovery of cathode material, wastewater EED, and CO2 capture and utilization. Based on the simulation results, system performance was evaluated considering the regenerated chemical concentration and its impact on the metal recovery rate. The complete regeneration of 2.04 M sulfuric acid and 1.09 M caustic soda solutions could be accomplished from the waste liquid. In recycling capacity of 50,000 ton/year, 0.33 kg of CO2 could be captured per 1 kg of LCO cathode material, and 99% selective metal extraction could be accomplished during battery recycling using the regenerated chemicals. To clarify economic performance, the levelized cost of recycling was analyzed in different market scenarios for chemicals. The proposed system can accomplish full regeneration of wastewater via EED with a 21.90% lower levelized cost of recycling compared with the conventional system.

However, these technologies have challenges in terms of high battery costs, energy consumption, and charging times. Battery-swapping charging stations have emerged as a solution to these problems, but it is necessary to ensure a sufficient number of batteries and charging slots. This research proposes a method for estimating these parameters for fleets of a different number of hybrid or electric motorcycles using a discrete event simulation. Routes are created to simulate the behavior of a fleet for a home delivery service. Then, by implementing a dynamic particle model dependent on route and vehicle parameters, the consumption for each trip is estimated. Finally, in the discrete event simulation, the number of batteries, charging slots, and motorcycles in circulation varied for each scenario. To provide a service that meets operator and user needs, design decisions are based on the following performance metrics: Average waiting times, motorcycle energy demand, the number of cycles the batteries reach in a year, and services served. The behavior of a fleet of hybrid or electric motorcycles in Medellin, Colombia, is simulated by varying the parameters up to 30 batteries, charging slots, and motorcycles in circulation. The results allowed us to identify a design basis for battery swapping stations where the waiting times stabilize regardless of the number of vehicles in circulation. On the other hand, there is a relationship between the number of batteries, charging slots, and the number of battery cycles, which in turn varies depending on motorcycle technology. Hybrid motorcycles generate a lower energy demand; simultaneously, they reduce battery usage and attend the station fewer times than electric motorcycles.

The proposed process paves the way for short-range effective separation of the high-value metals in the LIB black mass based on magnetism and water solubility differences. After hydrochlorination at 1000 °C for 30 min with the material bed measuring 9 mm in thickness, Li and Mn water recovery reached 97.28% and 98.13%, respectively. The Ni and Co recoveries into the magnetic fraction reached 93.03% and 91.37%, respectively. Up to 95.28% Al, including graphite, reported to the non-magnetic fraction. Prolonged hydrochlorination time increased the chlorination degree despite negatively affecting the Ni-Co alloy recovering efficiency. Conversely, an increase in the thickness of the material bed had a reverse effect. Step-wise precipitation of the water-soluble product produced high-purity Li2CO3 (≥99.5%) and Mn3O4.

In this study, a physics-based energy consumption model of BEVs is constructed and associated with a statistics-based model on the basis of travel surveys. A perceived cost of ownership (PCO) is then developed by adding intangible costs to traditional total cost of ownership models. We estimate, at the disaggregate vehicle model and driver level and the aggregate market level, 1) the extended range due to lightweighting for a given battery size; and 2) the optimal electric range based on lightweighting decisions. The cost-effectiveness of lightweighting for BEV range extension is found to vary with income-dependent daily range limitation value, driving patterns and lightweighting technology costs. In general, adopting lightweighting in BEVs is more cost-effective for consumers with higher daily limitation value, as well as for those with higher driving intensity or suitable daily driving patterns. When the lightweighting involves a higher vehicle production cost, less lightweighting could reduce the overall PCO for BEV owners. 4 of the selected top ten BEV models are found to benefit from additional 2.09%–4.45% lightweighting.

Thus, there is a need for new LCA studies at different scales (lab, pilot, industrial) using transparent datasets to facilitate more reliable and robust assessments. This work presents a screening of recent environmental assessments for LIBs at different production scales aiming at identifying remaining gaps and challenges, and deriving a detailed LCA of a lab-scale battery cell production. For the first time the environmental impact of a lab-scale battery production based on process-oriented primary data is investigated. The results are flanked by sensitivity analyses and scenarios and compared with literature values. The hotspots identified in this study, cathode slurry, anode current collector, as well as the energy demand of the dry room and coating process, are consistent with the literature, although the absolute values are an order of magnitude larger. The main reason for this are the inefficiencies inherent in lab-scale production. In order to analyze the effects of production scale, an upscaling to the pilot scale is performed.";"2023-01-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622050843";"32";"Batteries"

Indeed, the optimal management at the local scale of the match between energy demand and production is key to dealing with the technical and economic issues caused by the high variability of RES and EV charging demand. In this study, an environmentally oriented optimal design of a photovoltaic (PV) powered EV Charging Station (EVCS) integrated with an Electric Energy Storage System (ESS) is presented. Batteries characteristics and their role on life cycle emissions are also addressed. The system design is determined with the double aim of minimizing the carbon emissions due to the charging process and carbon footprint of the installed technologies and maximizing the self-consumption of local energy production. A bi-level optimization approach is adopted: a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm is used to optimally define the number of slow and medium EV Supply Equipment (EVSE), PV peak power and battery capacity, while a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) algorithm is used for the optimal control of the charging process. A comparison of different solutions is carried out over an eight-year time horizon, accounting for uncertainties in renewable generation and EV charging demand. The results highlight that the installation of Second-Life batteries as energy storage media in sustainable terms. Indeed, the cumulative CO2 emissions over the whole time horizon of the Electric Vehicle Charging Station are decreased by 15% and 10% respectively if compared with First-Life batteries and a baseline case without any stationary storage system. These results confirm that long-term evaluation of techno-environmental performance is crucial to make sustainable and conscious choices.

However, its prohibitive price hinders the practical development of these technologies, reflecting multiple problems in existing production processes including high temperature/energy demands, greenhouse gas emissions, low yield, low purity and the use of air sensitive equipment. Herein we report the development of an environmentally friendly process for the scalable production of Li2S without need for a glove box. The net chemical process is the reaction between Li metal and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) with ethanol as the auxiliary solvent, which can in principle be recovered and recycled. The production capability reaches 1.0 kg_Li2S/day, 50–100 times greater than the largest scale reported in the literature. The material quality of the resulting Li2S is validated through its use as a cathode material in lithium-sulfur batteries, achieving essentially comparable performance with commercial Li2S. Moreover, additional value is provided by concomitant H2 production which is demonstrated through its use for the in-situ reduction of copper oxide. We believe that the process described by this work can be readily adapted to support the developments of advanced batteries.

Currently, several incentive measures are being introduced and expected to address this waste management challenge, but the exact effects remain unclear. Therefore, an agent-based model of EV battery collection system is established in this study, which characterizes the heterogeneous interactive relationship, behavior rules and decision-making function of three main agents including residents, formal and informal collection enterprises. Eventually, the policy implementation effects are quantitatively evaluated. The results show that: (i) the publicity policy with the strongest implementation level leads to a 38.11% increase in the collection rate, which is defined as the ratio of the number of battery packs collected through formal channels to the total; (ii) the collection price subsidy policy of 80 RMB/kWh improves the collection rate by 109.87%; (iii) with the target level and intensity level set at 50 kWh and 80 RMB/kWh, the collection target policy enhances the market share of formal collection enterprises by 1.08%; (iv) with the combination of these three collection policies, the policy mix enhances the collection rate by 3.81 times, which is greater than the implementation effect of any single policy. In sum, this research will promote the sustainable supply chain management of EV batteries. With a further model extension, it can also provide decision support for the policy-making of more countries.

A case study for electric vehicle batteries";"With the growth of electric mobility, automotive manufacturers are nowadays facing the challenge of implementing a Circular Economy (CE) for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. Meanwhile, no consensus exists on how to assess material circularity and assign responsibilities across different business processes of the organization. To address this gap, the present study uses an illustrative case study of an automotive manufacturer seeking to improve the material circularity of its’ electric vehicle battery portfolio. Following a 3-step framework inspired by the British Standard BS 8001:2017, we investigate how business processes in relation to product development, supply chain, production, end-of-life and business models can contribute to the material circularity of EV batteries in different scenarios. Among the key contributions, the study firstly provides guidance for companies on how to model material circularity for batteries at company-level based on EV market projections. Secondly, our findings show that by combining a closed-loop production with different end-of-life strategies such as remanufacturing, repurposing and recycling, automotive manufacturers can increase material circularity for critical battery materials from 5% today to 23% by 2030. Thirdly, we specify how different business processes can contribute to increasing material circularity, including a) which business processes collaborate, b) the affected material streams (i.e. inflow or outflow), c) through which activities and d) to what extent, i.e. the impact on the quantitative results for material circularity.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135274";"Sustainable bioleaching of lithium-ion batteries for critical materials recovery ";" The demand for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) has increased substantially over the last few decades due to their longer lifetime, greater resistance to self-discharge, and higher output voltage compared to other battery types. With the global trend of electrifying vehicle fleets, the number of LIBs reaching their end-of-life (EOL) is expected to grow substantially in the next decade. These EOL LIBs represent a significant secondary source of materials (e.g., Li, Co, Ni, Mn) that can be recovered and reused in LIBs or other products. In this study, we developed a bioleaching process that could recover critical materials from EOL LIBs in an economical and environmentally sustainable manner under industrially relevant conditions. Black mass, i.e., cathode-containing powder, prepared from EOL LIBs was leached using a biolixiviant produced from corn stover by Gluconobacter oxydans bacteria. Iron(II) was used as a reducing agent to promote metal dissolution. Techno-economic analysis (TEA) estimated a potential average profit margin of 21% for processing 10,000 t of black mass per year, which represents approximately 30% of the available black mass in the US in 2020. Life cycle assessment (LCA) demonstrated that bioleaching of spent LIBs could be more environmentally sustainable than alternative hydrometallurgical recovery methods such as hydrochloric acid leaching (16–19 kg vs. 43–91 kg CO2 equivalent global warming potential per kg of recovered cobalt). The TEA results are highly dependent on the cost of black mass production, which varies by EOL LIB collection and transportation costs. Emerging technologies for deactivating used LIBs for fire safety at collection centers will allow the transport of EOL LIBs as non-hazardous materials, lower the cost of preparing black mass and thereby increase economic prospects for EOL LIBs recycling using this approach.

However, a critical challenge lies in the elimination of impurities during the purification and synthesis process to prevent decrease in electrochemical performance of the product. In this work, we propose a simple, clean and cost-effective route based on Al/Ti precipitation purification, followed by selective synthesis of FePO4·2H2O with coexisting divalent metal ions.

In this work, WCR with ferric impurity was recycled as dual-sites adsorbents for efficient removal of Cu2+ in wastewater. The adsorbent, sulfhydryl grafting Fe(OH)3/graphite (SFG), was synthesized by one-pot method. In this process, the ferric impurity was transformed into amorphous Fe(OH)3 in-situ, and sulfhydryl (-SH) was orderly grafted on adsorbent surface by regulation of 3-(Trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate (TPM). In the regulation, TPM combined adsorbent surface and cysteine molecule by its inorganic and organic ends. Furthermore, the filtrate and adsorbent could be reused many times. The adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order model, the isotherm fitted better with the Freundlich isotherm model, which indicated that the adsorption of Cu2+ on SFG was a multilayer and heterogeneous chemisorption process. Langmuir maximum adsorption capacity of Cu2+ was 185.2 mg/g which was higher than many similar adsorbents. Adsorption mechanisms were explored by material characterizations and DFT calculations. The –OH groups of Fe(OH)3 reacted with Cu2+ via ion-exchange, the sulfur atom in –SH groups chelated with Cu2+ by transferring electrons to Cu atom.

The harmless disposal and value-added utilization are necessary. In this paper, we propose a green route to sustainable reutilize vanadium from hazardous wastes as vanadium dioxide (VO2) cathodes for aqueous zinc ion batteries. The valence tuning from V5+, V4+, and V3+ in spent catalysts to V4+ in leaching solution has been realized by reduction acid leaching to ensure the complete recycle. The leaching rate of vanadium is 93.6%, and the vanadium content in the slag phase is less than 0.04%. Most V and few Fe and Al are extracted by P204 in organic phase, then diluted sulfuric acid is used for stepwise stripping from mixed V, Fe, and Al solution. Then high-purity (99.9%) vanadyl sulfate (VOSO4) solution is obtained after extraction and purification, which is used for the preparation of VO2 materials The assembled batteries by prepared VO2 exhibited a discharge capacity of 204.6 mA h g−1 at the first five cycles, and 172.5 mA h g−1 after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g−1. The capacity retention rate is 84.31% after 100 cycles.

To decarbonize the heat and transportation sectors, LCTs such as heat pumps (HP) and electric vehicles (EV) are integrated into the power system from the low voltage (LV) distribution network, where predominantly end-users are connected. However, the increasing penetration of EVs and HPs, together with distributed photovoltaic (PV) systems on the demand side, can cause technical challenges in LV distribution networks, such as under/over voltages at the far end of the feeders. Therefore, the hosting capacity of a grid for LCTs is limited due to network constraints such as line ampacity, bus voltage, and frequency. In this paper, voltage-constrained management approaches for LCTs are proposed to improve the grid hosting capacity in a real large-scale distribution network. Moreover, HPs, PVs, battery energy storage systems (BESS), and EVs as well as their vehicle-to-grid (V2G) feature are evaluated as LCTs. The uncertain behavior of these technologies is taken into consideration for more realistic analyses. In addition, the charging and discharging interactions of BESSs are controlled by following the power consumption profiles from the economic point of view. Furthermore, the hourly carbon data is used to control BESSs from an emission-sensitive aspect. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms, a series of tests is conducted on a real distribution network model. The results show that the hosting capacity of the considered LV network can be increased from 35% to 50% using the proposed algorithms.

Further, the modified asphalts with different WDBP contents were also prepared, and the enhancement effect of WDBP on the physicochemical properties of the binder was evaluated.

However, extracting gold from e-waste carries its own ecological footprint. Therefore, employing tools like Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to evaluate environmental impacts and identify mitigation measures is imperative. This research addresses critical gaps in the literature surrounding gold recovery from e-waste. It covers a range of methods, including hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical (well-established) to mechanical and biotechnological (less explored for gold recovery), rectifying the imbalance in methodological attention. This study also prioritizes environmental assessment, elevating LCA to a central investigative focus for understanding the sustainability of gold recovery from e-waste. Notably, there is a paucity of consistent and systematic comparisons between diverse gold recovery methods from e-waste in existing literature. While some publications touch on environmental aspects, comprehensive LCA investigations are lacking. Thus, this research explicitly bridges this gap through a comparative LCA, evaluating mechanical, hydrometallurgical, pyrometallurgical, electrochemical, and biotechnological methods and contrasting them with conventional mining (baseline method). The results highlight significant reductions in damage to human health, with the mechanical and electrochemical methods leading the way with a noteworthy 98% reduction compared to the baseline. The hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical methods also demonstrate substantial decreases of 83% and 92%, respectively. Though the biotechnological method exhibits a comparatively lower reduction of 60%, it represents a significant advancement in curbing damage to human health. Regarding ecosystem quality, the mechanical and electrochemical methods excel with exceptional reductions of over 99%, while the biotechnological, hydrometallurgical, and pyrometallurgical methods collectively achieve a decrease of approximately 99% compared to the baseline. Across the board, all evaluated methods manifest substantial reductions in total weighted environmental impacts, amounting to an approximate 99% reduction. The biotechnological method does entail the highest exergy demand, signifying greater energy consumption, while the mechanical method demonstrates the lowest exergy consumption.

In recent times, plasma gasification has been an attractive way of solid waste management towards energy recovery considering the environmental benefits. To reduce the short end-of-life electrical products and net CO2 emissions, the low-grade feed of electrical switch waste (ESW) comprising of bakelite (BAK) is chosen for generating clean syngas through the plasma method using CO2. The influence of the feed rate of solid waste, feed CO2 gas and plasma torch power on the product yield and syngas composition is evaluated. Energy and exergy (2-E) analyses are performed to assess the feasibility of the process. The experiment results indicate a maximum syngas yield of ∼85% at the highest torch power of 1.6 kW, with high concentrations of H2 (24.36 vol%) and CO (43.61 vol%). At low torch power of 0.5 kW, the residual solid yield reaches 24.58%. Considering all the cases, syngas with a medium calorific value of up to 10.20 MJ/m3 is attained. For the optimum feed rate of 40 g/10 min, CO2 flow rate of 0.6 lpm and plasma power of 0.75 kW, the process achieved the highest cold gas and exergy efficiency of 42.33% and 35.99%, respectively. The obtained oil (viscosity = 6.43 cP, density = 0.975 g/ml, pH = 8.01 and LHV = 31.47 MJ/kg) is suitable for applications in combustion, transportation and chemical production after quality upgradation.

Previous studies applied forecasting models, such as the grey model and artificial neural networks, to predict WEEE generation from a country perspective, leading to less accurate forecasts due to huge socio-economic differences in rural and urban areas. Additionally, there has been the incompatibility of a single forecasting model for all WEEE types, and this remained a research gap. Taking advantage of respective forecasting models, this study presents a hybrid model, Grey Artificial Neural Network, to forecast the WEEE generation of 31 province-level regions in China while evaluating the socio-economic analysis of seven WEEE types via Pearson correlation analysis. More than 70% of WEEE from province-level regions strongly correlates (R > ±0.8) with the gross domestic product and the population, whereas some top WEEE-generating province-level regions (i.e., Tianjin and Shanghai) correlate weakly to moderately. The root mean square error and mean absolute error of the developed Grey Artificial Neural Network hybrid model are the lowest at 8.29 and 6.48, compared to the grey model (13.53 and 11.13) and back-propagation neural network (9.21 and 7.22). Though the Grey Artificial Neural Network hybrid model has the lowest error, posterior mean square deviation ratio analysis indicates that this hybrid model is only suitable for washing machines, refrigerators, color televisions, and personal computers (urban area), while the back-propagation neural network is suitable for monochrome televisions, air conditioners, and personal computers (rural area). Compared to 2019, it is projected that an additional 32.92 M units of WEEE will be generated by 2025, suggesting that China should build at least 15 extra recycling centers (14% more based on 2016) to handle the increased WEEE generation. This study provides policy implications for effective WEEE monitoring and collection systems to build resilient WEEE management.

China is the highest producer of e-waste in Asia and faces severe e-waste recycling challenges. To analyse the influencing factors of consumers regarding different e-waste disposal types, this study conducted an empirical analysis using a questionnaire survey, chi-square test, and multiple correspondence analysis. A questionnaire was designed, and 1152 valid questionnaires were collected through pre-investigation and distribution. Descriptive statistics were administered for the household appliances (rice cookers, storage-type electric water heaters, and range hoods), the processing behaviour of the respondents, and material flow. The differences in the different types of e-waste disposal behaviours were tested through a chi-square test and multiple correspondence analysis. The empirical results showed (i) significant differences in consumers’ disposal behaviours of different types of household waste appliances, (ii) a heterogeneous correlation between consumers’ disposal behaviour of household appliances and socioeconomic variables, and (iii) regional differences in the disposal behaviour of different types of household waste appliances. Storage-type electric water heaters were repaired in rural areas and in cities were recycled, and rice cookers were recycled in rural areas and discarded in cities. The results emphasise the necessity for formal recycling companies to adopt different incentive policies for different types of household waste appliances to encourage consumers to actively participate in formal recycling.

In this study, we developed a carboxymethylated cellulose nanofibril aerogel crosslinked with citric acid (CMCNF-CA aerogel) through thermal treatment and employed it as an adsorbent for REE recovery. The CMCNF-CA aerogel possesses a substantial amount of free –COOH groups, resulting in a strong negative charge. This unique characteristic enables the aerogel to exhibit excellent adsorption capacities of 200 mg/g for lanthanum(La3+) and 170 mg/g for cerium(Ce3+). The findings from FTIR and XPS analyses provide insights into the adsorption mechanism. It is revealed that hydroxo-complexes, such as La-(OH)x and Ce-(OH)x, are adsorbed onto the CMCNF-CA aerogel through strong electrostatic interactions with the –COOH groups. This leads to the formation of metal ionic crosslinking. Remarkably, the CMCNF-CA aerogel maintains its high adsorption performance even after undergoing five consecutive adsorption-desorption cycles. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the CMCNF-CA aerogel is an efficient and reusable adsorbent for the sustainable recovery of La3+ and Ce3+ from aqueous solutions. This study offers promising prospects for addressing the challenges in the recycling of REEs, highlighting the potential of the CMCNF-CA aerogel as a practical solution in the field of REE recovery.

In order to examine the influence of government regulations on the choice of end-of-life vehicle (ELV) recycling, this study develops APR models for ELV take-back within a closed-loop supply chain (CLSC). These models consist of two direct APR models and one hybrid APR model, all operating under the purview of government regulation. The Stackelberg game is employed to attain an equilibrium strategy concerning the profits of CLSC members. Furthermore, this study conducts an analysis of the impact of recycling license fees and remanufacturing recycling rates on each CLSC member, based on the “Management Measures for Scrap Vehicle Recycling” issued in 2019. In every recycling model, automotive parts manufacturers consistently achieved greater profits compared to the nonrecycling model, while retailers also benefited from their involvement in recycling activities. Additionally, third-party profits experienced an exponential increase with the escalation of recovery rates. Numerical analysis results indicate that as the remanufacturing level of ELV matures, the government is inclined to relax the restrictions on the “remanufacturing recycling rate,” thus promoting the proliferation of third-party recycling centers.

Computer vision technology offers various benefits leading to sustainable improvements in e-waste management practices. It is expected that the adoption of computer vision technology will revolutionize the way processing is carried out in e-waste management by minimizing human intervention, processing time, and cost requirements. India, an emerging economy, faces enormous challenges in efficiently managing and controlling the continuously growing amount of e-waste and its impact on the environment and society.

This study estimated the quantities of valuable-resource components that could be recycled from 11 categories of unregulated WEEE generated in China between 2010 and 2030 using the material flow analysis and Weibull distribution-based lifespan model. The generation of these unregulated WEEE is expected to grow at an average annual rate of 9%, increasing from 2.17 million tons in 2010 to 12.1 million tons in 2030. As a result, the total economic value from the valuable-resource components from these 11 categories of unregulated WEEE is expected to decrease first from 102 billion USD in 2010 to 68.5 billion USD in 2019; subsequently, it is expected to gradually increase to 203 billion USD by 2030. Household baking apparatuses and household electric fans are expected to contribute to 55−68% of the total weights of unregulated WEEE, while electronics are expected to be the most significant source of economic value (92.7−98.7%). In addition, recycling electronics is also expected to be preferred from the point of recycling profits. These results can help close the knowledge gap on the economic potential of recycling the unregulated WEEE and guide the development of future policies on recycling WEEE.

A promising approach that can bring about change and help in addressing this wastage is the circular economy (CE). However, understanding how this approach can be successfully implemented when it comes to waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE), has remained surprisingly nascent to date. Therefore, this paper contributes to a better understanding of CE implementation in the WEEE sector by exploring its critical success factors (CSFs) and identifying their causal relationships and hierarchy of importance. To achieve this, a systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted to identify and understand the CSFs that influence the implementation of CE that were subsequently refined based on industry practitioners’ inputs in Bangladesh via a structured survey. Then, the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory approach integrated with intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IF-DEMATEL) was employed to understand their causal relationship and hierarchy of importance. A wide range of CSFs were identified, of which “Market Contenders” and “Formation of Cross-functional Teams” were found to be more prominent for the successful implementation of CE to address WEEE, and that “Global Standard” influences the majority of other CSFs, including “Skilled Manpower”, “Financial Sustainability”, “Consumer Awareness”, etc. The results of this study will help professionals and policymakers implement better e-waste management systems, which can lead to the development of eco-friendly businesses and innovative and flexible production systems.

However, the disposal of waste LCD is a complex coupling process affected by multi-factors. The lack of mature harmless and resource-based treatment process restricts the development of industrialization. Therefore, an environmentally sound process focusing on resource recovery was proposed to recover Sn efficiently and remove toxic substances from waste LCD in this study. The reaction mechanism and leaching kinetics were discussed assisted by mechanical activation, and the statistical and mathematical method (Box-Behnken Design (BBD) model) was adopted to optimize the leaching process. The results showed that the mechanical activation could improve the physical and chemical properties of ITO glass. The essence of the leaching reaction mechanism was that the H+ in H2SO4 combined with O2− in the lattice of In2O3 to form OH−, resulting in Sn–O bond broking and Sn4+ entering the aqueous solution. Furthermore, the Zeta potential results showed that the Zeta potential of SiO2 particles less than 0.035 mm was close to zero near pH 2, resulting in agglomeration between SiO2 particles under the action of Coulomb force. The leaching kinetics was well expressed by the shrinking core model. The BBD model showed satisfactory correlation between the predicted and actual results, and the particle size was the most critical factor affecting the leaching efficiency. The maximum leaching efficiency was 87.6% which was obtained under the following optimal condition: 6 mol/L H2SO4, 108 min, 88 °C, and 0.035 mm ITO glass powder.

Three recycling pricing strategies of the manufacturer are discussed: a low recycling price only attracts consumers who do not purchase EW, a high recycling price attracts two types of consumers or discriminatory recycling prices for both types of consumers. The results show that discriminated pricing can attract consumers to participate in product recycling, improving product recycling quantity and saving manufacturing costs. The high recycling price is applicable when the base warranty period is short, and the residual value of the old products is low. The manufacturer and the e-commerce platform can both benefit from the three recycling strategies as compared to non-recycling.

PCFs characterization and mechanistic investigations were carried out using FT-IR, XPS, XRD, FE-SEM, EDX, and HR-TEM. After 0.5 h of Au(III) adsorption on the PCFs, Au(III) was reduced to Au(I) owing to electron transfer when –NH3 +/−NH2 +‒, functional groups of PCFs, were oxidized to = NH+‒ and = N‒. After 12 h, –NH3 +/−NH2 +‒ were oxidized to = N‒, and C–N was oxidized to CO; therefore, Au(I) present on the fibers was reduced to Au(0) owing to the oxidation–reduction reaction. The released nitrogen was detected as NO2 − and NO3 − in the solution. Subsequently, the Au particles detached from the PCFs, and the aggregated Au particles on the vessel wall were recovered.

Toxic chemical components of WEEE can negatively impact ecosystems and human health and pose a severe threat to accomplishing sustainable development goals (SDGs). This review article provides an in-depth survey of UEEE and its differences from WEEE. UEEE is examined in detail to determine whether it is a potential toxic threat or a valuable source. If the transboundary flows of UEEE occur under legal regulations, it is a step toward a circular economy (CE), and the UEEE is recognized as a valuable resource. Otherwise, it is a potential threat to developing countries. Furthermore, the UEEE and WEEE are assessed from the perspective of international law, particularly the transboundary movement guidelines. In the following, the challenges in the transboundary flows of UEEE from developed to developing countries are mentioned. These challenges include a lack of inventory data, weak waste management policies and laws, expansion of the informal sector, and weak monitoring by law enforcement agencies for reliable environmental management. Finally, solutions to current challenges are presented. Undoubtedly, proper global management and legislation of UEEE and WEEE can help reduce the risks of e-waste and be the most effective way to achieve sustainable development goals.

The global demand for cobalt is expected to grow significantly, leading to an enhanced global cobalt trade network. However, such trade induced a large amount of embodied CO2 emission, which has not been explored. This study fills this research gap by employing a trade-linked material flow analysis (MFA) for the year 2020. Future supply and demand for cobalt are also predicted by conducting scenarios analysis. Results show that consumer batteries (CB) and electric vehicles (EVs) were the top two primary cobalt consumption sectors in 2020. Also, regional disparities existed in terms of corresponding CO2 emissions and environmental externalities related with the global cobalt trade. Trade activities for cobalt-containing final products led to the highest embodied CO2 emission. It is therefore urgent to encourage cobalt recycling, internalize environmental externalities, mitigate cobalt supply risks, and encourage technology innovation.

This study develops a CGE model including RE generation and RE storage with induced technological change (ITC). Our study further analyzes the environmental and economic impacts of electrification and environmental policies on RE development and RE storage with ITC and the results are as follows: 1) a single carbon tax policy is not an appropriate instrument to pursue both environmental and economic gains against CO2 abatement and energy structural transition. 2) carbon tax with subsidy to RE storage is conducive to clean energy structural shift and economic growth in long term but it imposes slight negative impact on GDP in medium term. Furthermore, it cannot achieve 25% of non-fossil fuel consumption goal by 2030. 3) Single electrification will increase the electricity demand significantly, including both thermal and nonthermal power, thereby cause more carbon emission and GDP loss in short run. While LBD in RE and RE storage sector facilitated by electrification contributes to more GDP gain, carbon mitigation and non-fossil fuel consumption rate in long run compared to carbon tax and subsidy scenarios. 4) Electrification with carbon tax and subsidy to RE storage leads to greater CO2 mitigation and less subsidy to RE storage, better economic performance in CTSE compared to other scenarios, showing vital role of ITC in RE and power storage. 5) Promoting the LBD process is an efficient way to encourage RE development under electrification.

However, battery-electric trucks are not a one-fits-all solution due to current battery technology limitations and vast diversity in freight operations and vehicle categories. Although the literature available in electric truck feasibility provides an insightful overview of their potential, it does not fully cover the performance variations under adverse climate and technical conditions. This paper attempts to fill the gap in the literature by quantifying the impact of low temperatures, headwind, variable payload, and tail-lift use over different freight vehicles from a case study fleet in Iceland. NREL's FASTSim is the vehicle energy consumption model used for the analysis. The study also addresses on-route fast-charging, considering realistic non-linear charging rates and performance in low temperatures. The results showed that the range of the analyzed vehicles can experience a decrease of 41–47% under unfavorable conditions, compared to the estimated range under ideal conditions. Short-haul routes could be electrified even under the most challenging conditions, while regional routes might require some planification adjustments to reach 100% route electrification in tough conditions. On-route charging would be necessary to achieve full fleet electrification. In tough conditions, sprinter vans met 49% (85% with charging) of the analyzed routes, while trucks met 83% (90% with charging). The outcomes of this research support several UN Sustainable Development Goals (3, 7, 8, 11, 12, 13), and could be used to develop specific measures within the Icelandic 2020 Climate Action Plan. The methodology used is feasibly replicable for teams who wish to perform a similar analysis in different contexts.

It is imperative to evaluate the environmental sustainability of ESSs in grid applications to achieve sustainable development goals. In the present work, a cradle-to-grave life cycle analysis model, which incorporates the manufacturing, usage, and recycling processes, was developed for prominent electrochemical energy storage technologies, including lithium iron phosphate batteries (LIPBs), nickel cobalt manganese oxide batteries (NCMBs), and vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs). A case study was conducted based on per MWh of energy stored. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of LIPBs, NCMBs, and VRFBs under the Chinese electrical grid peak-shaving scenario were determined to be 323, 263, and 425 kg CO2-eq/MWh, respectively. The key components contributing to the GHG emissions were identified. The GHG emissions of different batteries in renewable energy sources (photovoltaic and wind) were evaluated. Moreover, the GHG emissions under the future electricity mixes were predicted according to the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals. The GHG emissions of LIPBs, NCMBs, and VRFBs under the Announced Pledges Scenario could be reduced by approximately 23–27% in 2030 and 66–75% in 2050. Moreover, sensitivity analysis was performed, indicating that the GHG emissions were directly linked with the round-trip efficiency.

The process integration technique is integrated into the Energy Hub model to deal with the multi-process synergy and temporal source-load matching. The system design and dispatch strategy are optimized by an augmented ε-constraint method with three objectives (economics, carbon emission, and fossil fuel consumption), and then the optimal tradeoff solution is identified by the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution. Moreover, a novel multi-energy complementary distributed energy system is developed, which includes comprehensive utilization of solar energy (photovoltaic, photothermal, and thermochemical) and middle-low temperature heat utilization technologies, as well as hybrid energy storage technologies. Finally, a case study located in Beijing is selected as an illustrated example. The obtained single-objective optimization solutions and Pareto optimal solutions are further analyzed and compared in terms of system configuration, hourly/yearly energy balance, and thermal integration condition. The results show that the multi-energy complementary distributed energy system presents an economic benefit (reducing 25% of the annual total cost) compared to a gas turbine-based integrated energy system. Considering thermal integration contributes to 5.13% of the cost reduction.

However, two primary objectives of such systems, namely cost and CO2 minimization, are contradictory goals that cannot be optimized simultaneously. This paper formalizes photovoltaic-battery systems using the multi-objective mixed integer linear programming approach, optimizing the battery installed capacity and operation strategy based on the hourly electricity price and carbon emission factor. The investigation on a commercial building identifies that pursuing cost minimization can partially decrease emission, while minimizing CO2 even causes additional cost. The tradeoff between cost and CO2 diminishes when the grid becomes more volatile, and the incorporation of rooftop photovoltaics can further enhance the battery's effectiveness. As a result, a nearly zero-carbon building is economically realized through 60% renewable penetration in the grid and 50% rooftop photovoltaics, with an electricity cost of 0.05 $/kWh and a CO2 emission of 0.07 kg/kWh, respectively. Moreover, implementing a demand-side carbon tax can be facilitated with intense grid volatility. The novel approach assists buildings in adopting the most cost-effective investment and operation strategy of photovoltaic-battery systems towards zero carbon under various grid conditions.

Recently, they have merged in a new product: the electric sport utility vehicle. This paper contrasts the view that regards this innovation as a technological solution to mitigate road transport emissions with a broader view that takes into account the battery requirement and profitability of such type of electric car. This broad view is formalised in a system dynamics model that captures the potential effects of supply side constraints. Four scenarios are simulated. The results show that the levels of CO2 emissions of new cars are substantially reduced only in the one that assumes lower motorisation. Based on these simulations, the conclusion that the diffusion of electric sport utility vehicles does not necessarily contribute to mitigating car emissions in Europe is drawn. Less reliance on technology fixes, downsizing and reduced motorisation are identified as solutions worth investigating to meet ambitious climate goals.

Australia, with one of the highest rates of rooftop solar PV, is still developing policy options to manage these panels when they reach their end-of-life. This study evaluates the environmental impacts of three options for mono and multi crystalline silicon (c-Si) solar panel waste modules. The impact of transport distance from transfer stations to the recycling centre is also assessed. The life cycle assessment revealed that, -1 E+06 kgCO2eq and -2 E+06 kgCO2eq are associated with the mandatory product stewardship scenarios under global warming potential for mono and multi c-Si solar modules, respectively. However, the non-existence of a product stewardship will produce a global warming impact of 1 E+05 kgCO2eq for both modules. The global warming effects revealed that, collecting and recycling most of the multi c-Si panels were not effective (−365.00 kg CO2-eq, −698.40 kg CO2-eq, −1032.00 kg CO2-eq) compared to keeping them away from the landfills and fully recycling (-2 E+06 kg CO2-eq) them. It was also highlighted that, the highest environmental impact regarding the transport distances was the scenario of one recycling centre serving over 107 transfer stations with a global warming potential of 1 E+06 kgCO2eq.

It is found that the synergistic effect of CO2 and SO2 in the industrial sector is prevalent in most provinces in China. Every 10,000 tons of CO2 emission reduction leads to 1600 tons of SO2 emission reduction.

The results indicate that, if fast implemented, bio-concrete solutions with short-rotation vegetal species as bamboo, coupled with the lowest material intensity scenario, can reduce the cumulative carbon emissions by 65%, equal to 118 Mt of cumulative CO2-eq savings. Considering bamboo's widespread availability in Brazil's different climate zones, and in the Global South in general, such material presents a significant impact to mitigate the climate impact of social housing. However, the carbon saving intensity is largely affected by uncertainties on population growth and the type of biomass used in the concrete mixture. Therefore, further development of standards for the safe use of bio-concrete in construction is urgently needed, as well as the implementation of environmental policies to facilitate the market penetration of bio-based solutions in emerging economies.";"2023-12-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623040209";"10";"Emissions"

Empirical evidence based on China's key regional air pollution and control policy ";" Promoting high-quality export development is a crucial strategic decision for economic transformation and upgrading. However, the effects and potential mechanisms of environmental regulations on firms' export product quality remain a subject of debate. This study investigates the impact of environmental regulations on firms' export product quality by analyzing firm-level data from 2000 to 2013. The study employs a quasi-natural experiment that focuses on the Key Air Pollution Control Zone (KRAPC) implemented by the central government in 2010. We found that environmental regulations, as represented by this policy, significantly enhance the firms' export product quality. At the macro perspective, this improvement primarily stems from the reduction of air pollution in the designated areas, and advancements in regional innovation and human capital. At the micro perspective, the main mechanisms are the reallocation of resources and the “Porter effect”. The former mainly involves reducing the production scale or even withdrawing high-energy-consuming and high-polluting enterprises, resulting in improved export product quality among new market entrants. The latter is manifested through enhanced enterprise innovation abilities, increased productivity, and reduced production costs. Furthermore, the impact of the KRAPC policy on firms’ export product quality varies depending on factors such as ownership, size, and technology intensity. In addition, the policy has positive spillover effects on neighboring non-key areas. Therefore, this study supports the government in formulating a scientific environmental policy that promotes a mutually beneficial relationship between economic growth and environmental protection.

This paper thoroughly investigates the structure of power investment and transmission network in China and neighbouring countries, aiming to promote the large-scale use of renewable energies around Asia. Various power-generation and power-transmission technologies are considered in detail, and transnational power interconnection risk cost and carbon emission cost are embedded into a bottom-up optimization model. The future power-generation structures and networks installed under various policy scenarios are analysed in detail, and the corresponding economic, carbon emission reduction and renewable energy consumption benefits are evaluated. The results show that power transmission between China's internal regions and neighbouring countries can save $56.7 billion for the entire power system through the large-scale grid integration of renewable energy. The installed capacities of wind power, solar power, and hydropower renewable energy power generation could be increased by 141 GW, 163 GW, and 58 GW, respectively. The construction of transnational transmission lines from Central Asia to Northwest China, Mongolia to North China, the Russian Far East to Northeast China, and Northeast China to South Korea could effectively promote the utilization of renewable energy in the Russian Far East, Mongolia and Central Asia and further reduce carbon emissions in China, Japan and South Korea.

Environmental concerns can evolve into environmental regulation in the legal sense, as well as environmental attention in informal rules. Although there has been a lot of research on environmental regulation and green open innovation (proportion of collaborative filings in green patents), there is still a lack of identification of the impact of the role of environmental attention, especially in heavily polluting industries that are critical to the economy. Based on this background, this paper uses the relevant data of listed companies in China's heavily polluting industries as a research sample. We use neural networks (Word2Vec) to extract indicators of environmental attention from the text of listed companies' annual reports and measure their impact on green open innovation using multidimensional fixed effects regression. Our research shows that the environmental attention of listed companies in highly polluting industries will significantly reduce their ability to engage in green open innovation. Ultimately, our study will help managers in heavily polluting industries rebalance the economic benefits and environmental transformation of their companies.

Global sensitivity analysis of circular economy strategies for the United Kingdom";"Limiting the global temperatures to +1.5 °C from pre-industrial levels requires achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. This should be achieved across all sectors, and for electrical and electronic equipment (EEE) the promotion of repair, lifetime extension and other Circular Economy (CE) strategies are often proposed as the main areas for intervention. However, few studies have quantified and compared the effectiveness of different CE strategies at reducing emissions at a national level and into the future. To fill this gap, an extended dynamic stock model was combined with a device energy consumption model to anticipate the embodied, operational, and repair energy requirements arising from the stocks and flows of seven devices up to 2050 in the United Kingdom (UK). To understand the relative influence of all model inputs on device energy demand in 2050, a variance-based sensitivity analysis was performed using the Sobol method. The results show that device size is the most significant variable for six out of the seven devices. Whereas substantial increases in device lifetime and repair rates were shown not to be significant in reducing energy demand. A reduction of 30% of energy demand by 2050 is possible for almost all EEE devices, except laptops and TVs. However, delivering these savings requires significant changes to consumption behaviours such as decreasing device size by about 40% or decreasing ownership rates by approximately two thirds through shared ownership. This analysis prioritises the most impactful strategies to reduce the total energy demand of EEE in the UK.";"2023-12-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623039045";"2";"Emissions"

This research aimed to quantify the GHGEs associated with household purchases of major food groups in New Zealand and identify the demographic characteristics that are associated with per capita household dietary emissions. Household dietary emissions were estimated using the Nielsen Homescan(R) consumer panel — a large sample of households within New Zealand (N = 1775) who report purchasing data of take-home food and beverages. The sample is nationally representative in terms of broad geographical regions and selected key demographic characteristics. Carbon emission estimates were assigned to 1,908,485 total purchases in 2019 using a process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) dataset initially constructed in the United Kingdom (UK) and adapted for New Zealand. The emissions from purchases of major food groups were then estimated. Multiple linear regression was used to examine the relationships between household variables and per capita dietary emissions. Purchases of red and processed meat (35%) and dairy products (19%) were responsible for the greatest proportion of emissions using a 100-year time horizon. The age group of the primary household shopper as well as household size were predictors of per capita dietary emissions — households with primary shoppers >65 years had, on average, 33% (95% CI: 19%–49%) higher per capita dietary emissions, compared to households with primary shoppers ≤ 34 years; and every additional household member was associated with, on average, 11% (95% CI: 9%–13%) lower per capita dietary emissions. We have shown in this large representative sample of New Zealand households that purchases of just two food groups — red and processed meat, and dairy — were responsible for 54% of dietary greenhouse gas emissions in 2019. Larger households had lower per capita dietary greenhouse gas emissions, and older shoppers had relatively higher greenhouse gas emissions. Whilst similar associations have been reported elsewhere, more research is needed to confirm these latter findings.

Meanwhile, fiscal policy is also an indispensable component of the public policy framework supporting the green and low-carbon transformation. This paper uses the pilot project of “Comprehensive Demonstration Cities for Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction Fiscal Policies” (“ECER-CD” policy) implemented in China since 2011 as a quasi-natural experiment. This research theoretically analyzes and empirically tests the energy conservation and emission reduction effects of fiscal policies supporting green and low-carbon transformation utilizing methodologies such as time-varying DID and multiple periods and multiple groups of DID. The study finds that the pilot cities effectively reverse the behavioural bias of local governments and promote energy conservation and emission reduction efforts. This conclusion holds after undergoing robustness tests such as parallel trend analysis and heterogeneity treatment effects. The effectiveness of the pilot policy is attributed to the upgrade of industrial structure, improvement of energy efficiency, and the effects of green technology innovation. However, cities’ geographic location and resource dependency can interfere with the effective implementation of policies. This paper also further explores the environmental dividends and economic consequences of the policy and finds that the pilot cities have certain environmental dividends and do not significantly restrain economic and social development. This study broadens the research perspective on fiscal policies in energy conservation and emission reduction and clarifies the pathways through which fiscal policies promoting green, low-carbon transformation drive energy conservation and emission reduction in cities. Moreover, it also improves the use of the Difference-in-Differences method in evaluating policy effects in scenarios such as the overlapping implementation of pilot policies and policy withdrawal. Finally, this paper proposes policy recommendations to provide more empirical evidence for China to accelerate the green and low-carbon transformation of the economy and society.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139773";"Physicochemical characteristics of ash-bridges in diesel particulate filter ";" The diesel particulate filter (DPF) is one of the most effective devices for reducing particulate emissions from diesel engines so as to satisfy emission regulations, and it has been widely utilized worldwide. After prolonged operation of the DPF, the accumulated non-combustible ash particulates can be sintered with filter walls and form ash-bridges, which will deteriorate DPF performance and increase emissions. Understanding physicochemical characteristics of ash-bridges is essential for elucidating the generation and evolution mechanisms of ash-bridges. Since lubricant additives are the main source of ash particulates, this study prepared four DPFs containing ash-bridges through accelerate ash loading experiments based on Zn-based, Ca-based, Mg-based, and composite lubricant additives. Subsequently, X-ray computed tomography (X-CT), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) were employed to analyze the structural characteristics, micro-morphology, and chemical composition of ash-bridges inside each DPF. The results indicate that Zn-based and composite ashes formed numerous fine ash-bridges in the middle of the DPF, whereas Ca-based and Mg-based ashes resulted in fully shaped and highly blocked ash-bridges. These ash-bridges aggregated into compact ash plugs downstream in all DPFs. The micro-morphology of Zn-based ash-bridges appeared as ball-and-stick, Ca-based ash-bridges aggregated into large ash aggregates in DPF downstream, Mg-based ash-bridges exhibited characteristics of high porosity, and the micro-morphology of composite ash-bridges is spherical in DPF downstream. The primary components of ash-bridges in Zn-based, Ca-based, and Mg-based DPFs are Zn2P2O7, CaSO4, and MgO, respectively. The main components of ash-bridges in composite DPF include Ca7Mg2P6O24, Zn3(PO4)2(H2O)4, and CaSO4. These findings provide valuable insights into the understanding of ash-bridges, contributing to the enhancement of DPF performance and durability.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139679";"Green premium modeling based on total cost ownership analysis: From the Chinese Electric Vehicle sales forecasting perspective ";" In the field of energy economics, the concept of “green premium” refers to the cost difference between zero-emission or emission-reducing technologies and emission-emitting technologies. This cost difference plays a crucial role in the adoption and commercialization of renewable energy technologies, which is essential for addressing climate change. However, the green premium, as an abstract concept, is often used qualitatively, and research on quantifying the green premium is very limited. This has significant adverse effects on both the formulation of business strategies for companies and the planning of government policies. The Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) method is a widely used cost analysis approach in businesses and organizations. It can quantitatively assess and understand the overall costs associated with specific products, assets, or services, thereby assisting decision-makers in making informed choices and managing resources. Therefore, this study introduces, for the first time, a TCO-based green premium modeling model to address the challenge of quantifying the green premium. Considering that China’s Electric Vehicles (EVs) industry has successfully overcome the green premium barrier and entered the commercialization phase, it is an appropriate domain for studying the green premium. To further demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the modeling, this paper enhances the classic Bass model for sales forecasting of electric vehicles. It innovatively incorporates the influence of the green premium in the generalized Bass model. Additionally, the study uses primary data from industry research to construct a multi-factor green premium model for EVs based on TCO analysis. It also develops a generalized Bass diffusion model that considers the green premium and selects time-series data on EV diffusion in the Chinese market from 2010 to 2021. A genetic algorithm is employed to fit the model parameters, and different scenarios are considered to forecast EV market penetration over the next decade. Experimental results validate that incorporating the green premium in the generalized Bass model leads to better forecasting performance compared to methods that do not consider the premium which proved these related green premium modeling approaches exhibit good accuracy and scalability.

Therefore, based on a sample of Chinese listed companies that publicly disclosed questionnaires in the CDP from 2009 to 2021, this paper empirically examines the relationship between emission reduction commitments and carbon risk premium and their formation mechanism. The results show that emission reduction commitments can effectively hedge the carbon risk premium, which pass several robustness tests. Specifically, the more comprehensive and ambitious the commitment is, the greater the suppression of the carbon risk premium. The mechanism test shows that disclosing emission reduction commitment information can reduce carbon risk by improving investor confidence and attracting political resources. Differences in enterprise emission levels, regional environmental regulation intensity and green financial development result in different risk-hedging effects of emission reduction commitments. Moreover, the greater the substantial pressure from stakeholders, the greater the tendency for firms to set up emission reduction commitments. Finally, the heterogeneity analysis reveals that confidence level of commitments has a significant impact on risk premium. Specifically, enterprises with SBTi validation, higher CDP ratings and higher target completion are more helpful in curbing carbon risk premium.

Road density per capita was identified as a more significant explanatory variable than GDP per capita in estimating 2W fleet size in India. The elasticity method was used to evaluate the 2W vehicle saturation level based on five different indirect parameters. It was found that population density had the highest impact (48%), followed by urbanization (31%) and adult population share (16%). The impact of the total cost of ownership was negligible. The mean 2W vehicle saturation level was calculated to be 314 while the ownership was found to be 207, 265, and 297 vehicles per 1000 people by 2030, 2040, and 2050, respectively. Scooters were found to be leading the e-transition of 2Ws but a successful e-transition of India's 2Ws would not be achieved without transitioning the motorcycles. Two motorcycle clusters were identified that offer economies of scale towards e-transitioning. Closer scrutiny of six plausible e-transition scenarios showed that a 50% penetration of E−2Ws is unattainable before 2045. The biggest obstacle in achieving high E−2W penetration in India would be the limited capacity to supply indigenously produced vehicles. A high import dependence on battery technology and critical raw materials would limit the energy transition and diversification of the Indian road transport sector. India should follow the mass adoption-driven diffusion pathway in the short-to-medium term and the affordability-constraint diffusion pathway in the long term to achieve the best results in terms of reduction in energy demand and associated emissions for the 2W segment.

Using bivariate and regression analysis, the study found that across all levels of climate-sustainability perception the CBCF the respondents ranged from 6.3 to 11.3 tCO2-eq/capita, representing a significant difference (79%) between the highest emitting (very low perception) and lowest emitting groups (high perception). A general negative correlation between elevated levels of climate-sustainability perception and CBCF was found, predominantly in the areas of diet, vehicle possession, and consumption of goods and services. Intriguingly, a counterintuitive increase in CBCF at extremely high levels of climate-sustainability perception was seen. Additional factors that contribute to higher climate-sustainability perception are explored, such as age, climate literacy, and pro-climate attitude (PCA). Conversely, individuals with high incomes or belonging to households with children display lower levels of climate-sustainability perception. Across all perception groups, however, the results confront the perception of the Nordics as climate leaders as Nordic CBCFs were still far above the average CBCF for the lowest global 50% of Earth's population and were far above (∼2–4x) suggested 2030 targets to remain below 1.5 °C warming. The findings of this study serve as an invaluable resource for policymakers aiming to align public perception with effective sustainability measures, thereby assisting in reducing CBCF and achieving global climate goals.

However, there has been limited research quantitatively exploring carbon emission spatial targets and efficient algorithmic optimization in a systematic manner. To investigate regional carbon emission compliance and systematic optimization methods, this study takes Shanghai Pudong New Area in China as a case study. It integrates an improved Kaya identity model for forecasting, carbon emission intensity analysis, and an enhanced multi-objective genetic algorithm for land-use optimization. The study aims to predict and account for carbon emissions, compare them against carbon emission targets, analyze spatial influencing factors, and consider relevant policy constraints to simulate low-carbon land-use layouts. The findings reveal the following: (1) Through scenario forecasting and carbon emission accounting analysis, it is evident that Pudong New Area's carbon emissions do not meet the target requirements. There is potential for optimization in terms of the balance between residential and workplace spaces, land use mix, and ecological areas. (2) After applying the genetic algorithm optimization, the carbon emissions in the land-use layout plan are reduced by 11.2%–27.88 million tC compared to the original planning scheme. (3) In simulated scenarios, there are significant changes compared to planned land-use layouts, including a 49% increase in the balance between residential and workplace areas, a 20% increase in land use mix, and a 33.9% increase in per capita park green space.This systematic optimization approach effectively predicts carbon emissions, adjusts land-use layout, and achieves a reduction in carbon emissions. The conclusions provide valuable technical support for low-carbon land-use planning and offer insights for the low-carbon development of other cities.""

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from these farms cannot be ignored. In this study, we created an agricultural environmental impact evaluation framework for China based on a localized database through an extensive survey. The survey was based on face-to-face interviews by 120 investigators with 1015 smallholders in 100 villages within Chinese major agricultural regions. The GHG emissions of each smallholder farmer's staple grain production was assessed on a case-by-case basis. Structural equation models were used to analyze the influence paths of production behavior. The results showed that GHG emissions from smallholder grain production exceeded average global levels. Despite some regional differences, synthetic fertilizers were the main source of GHG emissions from all farm inputs. Increased farm size can reduce nitrogen fertilizer use. The GHG emissions can be reduced by 203.59–279.90 Tg CO2eq, and profits would increase by 62.05–92.42 billion CNY in China, when all smallholders are managed in the same way as the top 25% or 10% of outstanding producers without applying higher nitrogen fertilizer application than the national recommendation. It is urgent and necessary for smallholders to change production practices to reduce their reliance on fertilizers to achieve climate goals.

As one of the important coal burning sources, coal-fired boilers have become the important challenges of the policy of “carbon peaking” and “carbon neutrality” of Chinese government. In this paper, the emission inventory of air pollutants (TSP, SO2, NOX, VOCs), and greenhouse gases (GHG, including CO2, CH4, N2O) from coal-fired industrial boilers (CFIB) from 2006 to 2020 are established by using the “bottom-up” emission factor method. Besides, Kaya identical equation and Logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) model are used to quantify the driving forces of the changing tendency in pollutants emission based on five driving factors, which include pollution production coefficient (f), control technology level (β), economy (GOV), industrial energy intensity (e) and coal consumption structure of industrial boilers (s). Combined with existing relevant policies, the future emission tendency of air pollutants and GHG in 2025 and 2030 is projected. The result shows that policy adjustment has a significant impact on pollutant emission trends. In 2020, emissions of TSP, SO2, NOX, VOCs and GHG from CFIB in China are 679.5 kt, 644.7 kt, 603.9 kt, 40.7 kt and 4.4 × 105 kt CO2e, respectively. Control technology level is the main factor to the emission reduction of SO2 and TSP, which has caused a decrease of 4278.6 kt and 3337.3 kt in emissions of SO2 and TSP compared to those of 2006 respectively, while the influencing effect on NOX, GHG and VOCs was relatively weak. In addition, in the scenario of improved control technology, pollutant emissions could be reduced by 62.6%–94.9% until 2030.

Therefore, we are revisiting the nature of the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) at different stages of economic growth through both necessary and sufficient conditions under the cubic model specifications in India. Further, we extend the EKC framework by incorporating energy consumption, agricultural value added, trade, the world uncertainty index, and geopolitical risk as additional variables into the three preferred disaggregated greenhouse gas emission (GHG) models. This study employs an auto-regressive distributed lag model (ARDL). The empirical findings show evidence of the valid N-shaped EKC through both necessary and sufficient conditions for carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) and exhibit the presence of two real and distinct income turning points for both valid EKCs. In contrast, only the necessary condition supports the N-shaped EKC for methane (CH4) emissions in India. Further, the results highlight that trade has a positive impact, whereas the world uncertainty index has a negative impact on disaggregated GHGs. Similarly, geopolitical risk has a negative effect on CH4 and N2O, whereas energy consumption has a positive impact on CO2 emissions. Moreover, agricultural value added has a negative effect on CH4 and a positive effect on N2O emissions.

However, there has been limited research assessing the “climate resilience of sustainability” — the capacity of national sustainability to withstand and recover from the impacts of climate change — over time and space. To bridge this gap, we quantify the climate resilient performance of sustainability (including social, economic, and environmental sub-resilient performance and comprehensive performance) in 37 sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries. We employed a coupling coordination degree model and panel regression to analyze the synergy between sub-dimensional resilience and explore the association between climate resilience of sustainability and other variables, respectively. Our findings indicate that while current development in most SSA countries lacks resilience, the score gap of climate resilience of sustainability between these countries is narrowing. On average, coastal countries exhibit lower performance in terms of the resilience of sustainability to climate change compared to inland countries. Moreover, the climate resilient performance among the three dimensions for all income groups reached an intermediate-coordinated state in 2018. However, most SSA countries exhibited an asymmetric level of sustainability and its climate resilience. Furthermore, we identified significant correlations between variables such as governance, gross domestic product, population, and precipitation with the climate resilience of sustainability. The insights from this study emphasize the need to prioritize climate resilience of sustainability and provide a reference for researchers and policymakers worldwide, to shape a long-term, prosperous, and resilient future under climate change.

To determine and evaluate the (revealed) preferences of the public in reducing their personal carbon emissions, a conjoint analysis survey, using the PAPRIKA (Potentially All Pairwise RanKings of all possible Alternatives) method, was distributed to the public in a city in the south of England (Southampton). Knowledge of the deep-seated preferences of the public makes a fundamental contribution to future climate actions because it enables publicly acceptable system change to be developed. Results showed the public were unwilling to make large-scale lifestyle changes, even if they would cause large emission reductions. There was a clear preference for making relatively easy, convenient changes to behaviour rather than making more difficult personal lifestyle changes involving diet and transportation. A significant value-action gap is evident, with the public showing high awareness of the seriousness of climate change but showing an unwillingness to make deep cuts to their personal emissions. Demography and personal factors had a relatively low influence over preferences with trends generally staying the same across demographic groups, aside from income brackets. Participants believed that reductions in emissions should come from a ‘group effort’ from all levels of government, business, environmental groups and individuals. Few participants placed themselves as individual drivers of carbon emission reduction. In order to reduce emissions some form of intervention needs to be made, as the public are not personally willing to make large-scale reductions in carbon emissions, regardless of their environmental awareness or demography.";"2023-12-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623035564";"10";"Emissions"

However, few measurements of marine atmospheric NO2 hinder knowledge of trace gas trends and atmospheric chemistry evolution due to shipping emissions. In this study, we use long-term satellite observations of tropospheric NO2 column from the European TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and the Chinese Environmental trace gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) to analyze marine atmospheric NO2 variations, especially during the global COVID-19 pandemic and escalating geopolitical crises. First, we demonstrate the detection of NO2 enhancements along shipping routes, including the North Atlantic route, the North Pacific route, and the Cape route, indicating significant emissions of atmospheric NO2 from on-ocean shipping. Second, we observe and quantify the response of marine atmospheric NO2 concentrations to major shipping events, such as the Suez Canal blockage, the Los Angeles-Long Beach port congestion, and the Russia-Ukraine war, resulting in local NO2 concentration variations of approximately 40% decrease to 70% increase. Long-term analysis reveals reduced NO2 concentrations in most coastal ports and maritime shipping routes during the COVID-19 lockdown, with reductions exceeding 50% or durations lasting up to 200 days. However, some rapidly developing ports, such as Beibu Gulf (China) and Dakar (Senegal), did not experience a decrease in NO2 concentrations, suggesting that local authorities need to pay more attention to these fast-growing yet underestimated emission sources. In addition, by excluding the impact of meteorology using statistical models, we find that the current Emission Control Area (ECA) policies have effectively reduced NO2 concentrations in Chinese coastal ports. These results contribute to understanding spatiotemporal characteristics of marine atmospheric NO2, including ports and open-sea shipping routes, and guide further ECA policies to control marine NO2 pollution.

Road pricing strategies have emerged as an effective approach to tackle urban transportation problems, and their successful implementation in numerous cities have garnered significant attention. In this context, this study introduces a collaborative road pricing strategy tailored for mixed traffic flow comprising both conventional vehicles (CVs) and new energy vehicles (NEVs). CVs and NEVs are considered as two distinct types of cars with heterogeneous characteristics. The collaborative road pricing strategy consists of two components: congestion pricing and emission pricing. A bi-level programming model for the collaborative road pricing strategy is built. Exhaust emissions within the low-emission zone (LEZ) are used as constraints for the model, while the optimization objective of the model involves minimizing the sum of total travel time and total emissions of the road network. The viability of the proposed collaborative road pricing scheme is demonstrated through numerical tests within the second ring road in Beijing, China. The results imply that the service level of the road network can be improved by implementing the collaborative road pricing scheme. It also concludes that, increasing the penetration of new energy vehicles would help to decrease traffic congestion and emissions.

This paper proposes a relational GVC emissions accounting framework based on an inter-country input-output (ICIO) model distinguishing between domestic-owned enterprises (DOEs) and foreign-invested enterprises (FIEs), which is classified as trade-based, investment-based and hybrid-based emissions. Using AMNE-ICIO tables from 2005 to 2016, this paper traces emissions and carbon intensity in relational GVC activities at the global, economic, and industry levels. We find the following: (1) Investment-based emissions accounted for about 94.15% of the increase in relational GVC emissions, of which more than half comes from the interactive activities between DOEs and FIEs. (2) For the United States, high-income economies, and high-tech manufacturing, investment-based emissions were higher than trade-based emissions, and the reverse was true for upper-middle and lower-middle income economies and China. (3) Although relational GVC carbon intensity was high, the trend of decline was significant. (4) Compared to trade activities, investment-based activities were less carbon intensity in China and upper-middle income economies due to the interaction of production between FIEs and DOEs.

Furthermore, the fundamental laws of CO2 emission reduction capacity with cost change of source substitutions for various steel production routes under market economics are unclear. To avoid the blind substitution of clean sources for meeting the urgent requirements for decarbonization in China's steel industry, which may result in increased carbon emissions and uneconomical carbon reduction from a lifecycle perspective.

Taking a capital-constrained engineering machinery remanufacturer as the research object, this paper first formulates four decision models, i.e. (no capital constraints, no financing), (capital constraints, no financing), (capital constraints, carbon quota repurchase financing) and (capital constraints, carbon quota pledge financing), then the equilibrium results are compared. Finally, the numerical simulations are performed to study the impact of carbon emission reduction and quality uncertainty of recycled products. The results show that if remanufacturers possess adequate carbon quotas, carbon quota pledge financing can always improve profits effectively, otherwise, the effectiveness of financing strategies depends on the difference between extra profits and financing costs. Both financing strategies can increase the output of new products and reduce that of remanufactured products. Increasing the quality threshold of recycled products is beneficial for remanufacturing, environmental protection and profits. Investing in carbon emission reduction benefits remanufacturing and the environment, however, it reduces remanufacturers' profits in the short term.

One way to increase biomethane production is through biological methanation, converting the remaining CO2 from biogas with hydrogen into methane. The required hydrogen is produced via electrolysis, making this technology also a valuable storage and balance solution for the energy grid. This study determines the ecological development potentials of biological methanation. For this purpose, different feedstock for anaerobic digestion are investigated as carbon source, effects of technological advances in electrolysis and biological methanation are determined and optimal modes of operation are evaluated. Results indicate that the biological methanation with an anaerobic digestion using manure as feedstock has the lowest greenhouse gas emissions. However, the biological methanation achieves the greatest reduction in emissions compared to traditional biomethane production (biogas upgrading with high pressurized water scrubbing) when using energy crops and reducing emissions from feedstock production. In the base scenario which represents the current state of technology, biogas from maize without additional methanation step produces 151.8 kgCO2eq/MWhCH4. In combination with biological methanation, biomethane can be produced in the future with CO2eq emissions of 121.4 kgCO2eq/MWhCH4. Other factors such as agricultural land occupation or water consumption show even more significant improvements. The main drivers of emissions are the electricity demand for the electrolysis and fugitive methane emissions.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139585";"The perspective of hydrogen direct reduction of iron ";" The work proposes a perspective on the direct reduction of iron (DRI) using hydrogen. Typically, iron is produced in blast furnaces (BFI) by the reduction of iron ore with carbon-rich materials such as coal or coke. Greenhouse emissions may be drastically reduced by introducing DRI coal/oil-based, and further reduced by using methane-based DRI. By increasing the share of hydrogen in the reducing gas by the addition of green hydrogen, the GHG emission further reduces. While hydrogen DRI becomes competitive for GHG emission with methane-based DRI once the electricity indirect emissions of GHG fall below 120 g CO2 per kWh, the full potential of hydrogen DRI is achieved phased with the complete uptake of green hydrogen, which is an essential component of a zero-emission stable electric grid fed with non-dispatchable renewables, as well as zero-emission non-electric total primary energy uses. The market perspective for hydrogen DRI in the short term is quite promising, and it is gaining significant attention and interest within the iron and steel industry. Key factors contributing to its market perspective are decarbonization and climate goals, policy support and incentives, investor interest, industry collaboration, technological advancements, sustainability, and brand value.

Reasonable carbon prices in stable carbon markets can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, to accurately predict carbon prices and describe their fluctuations, a hybrid model was developed based on Complete Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN), SampEn (SE), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Quantile regression (QR), and Kernel density estimation (KDE). First, CEEMDAN was used to decompose the original carbon price series into several Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), and the SE of each decomposed series was calculated to reconstruct a new series. The actual influencing factors determine the number of new series. The prediction model, named QRLSTM, combines QR and LSTM to achieve point and interval predictions. Finally, KDE was used to obtain a probabilistic prediction of the daily carbon price. Compared with other methods, the experimental results in Hubei, China, showed that the proposed CEEMDAN-SE-QRLSTM model had the best performance. For point prediction, the MSE, MAE, RMSE, MAPE, and R2 were 0.19, 0.33, 0.43, 0.01, and 91.7%, respectively. In interval prediction, the coverage width criterion (CWC) in the 95%, 90%, and 80% confidence intervals was small, with values of 0.37, 0.32, and 0.27, respectively. In probabilistic prediction, the continuous ranked probability score (CRPS) with 95% confidence was small, with a value of 0.25. In addition, the improvement in point prediction and stability of the hybrid model were also proved. The proposed model can provide more accurate results and valuable information for decision-makers.

This paper presents a multiperiod mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for the GSPS in iron and steel enterprises simultaneously optimizing total cost and carbon emission reduction. It was used to determine the optimal operating strategy for the GSPS under multiobjective conditions. The model considers the influence of a blast furnace with top-gas recycling (TGR-BF) technology on the by-product gas supply and steam and power cogeneration system (SPCS) operation. The results showed that after the optimization aiming at the minimum total cost (Scenario A) and the maximum carbon emission reduction (Scenario B), the system total cost was the lowest (7.78 billion CNY) when the top gas recovery rate was 4%, and the carbon emission reduction peaked at 465,296.76 tCO2 when the top gas recovery rate was 12%. After multiobjective optimization (Scenario C), it was found that the system achieved carbon reduction only when the total cost attained a certain value. A sensitivity analysis revealed that a reduction in the grid emission factor and an increase in the green power increased the carbon emission reduction. When the coal price increased to 1800 CNY/t or the power price decreased to 0.2 CNY/kWh, the optimal system operation strategy was consistent under different optimization objectives.

This study attempts to analyze the heterogeneous effect of DIEC on carbon emission reduction (CERE), in order to extend a valuable reference for effectively achieving the dual-carbon goal. Accordingly, the effect of DIEC on carbon emission scale (CESC) and carbon emission intensity (CEIN) are examined in this paper by using dual fixed effect model and intermediate effect model, respectively. The study findings show that, at first, DIEC significantly supports the CERE while significantly constraining the uplift in CESC and CEIN. Simultaneously, the CERE effect of DIEC contains digital economy dimensional heterogeneity, industry heterogeneity, production and life heterogeneity, and urban-rural heterogeneity. Finally, the DIEC boosts the technological innovation (TEIN) and residents' income (REIN) levels, in order to heighten the CERE. Further, improving invention technology innovation and TEIN is more conducive to catalyzing the reduction of carbon emission in the whole society and the production field. Conversely, the improvement of non-invention technology innovation and rural- and urban residents’ income impedes CERE in the field of life. Thus, the implications of this study are of vital significance for China and the rest of the world to foster CERE and achieve the “dual carbon” goal through DIEC development.

To address these challenges, predictive models are regularly used to estimate the emissions reduction potential of land management changes and to prioritize funding for projects. Despite their growing utility, few studies have evaluated the performance of publicly available model tools using site specific data. This study evaluated the performance and utility of four common model tools that represent the three Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change model tiers to predict soil organic carbon storage and estimate greenhouse gas emissions on working lands under organic matter amendment. Field data from two long-term, compost application experiments in Washington State formed the basis for model simulations using DayCent, COMET-Farm, Cool Farm, and the Washington State Climate Smart Estimator (WaCSE). Soil carbon sequestration and emissions estimates varied among the evaluated models, which was expected given their differential data requirements and input capabilities. COMET-Farm, although easier to use, exhibited a higher level of bias compared to DayCent, which was expected as a mixed tier model. The DayCent model, the model engine for the COMET-Farm tool, demonstrated the ability to explain ∼50% more of the variation in the observed values compared to COMET-Farm when initiated using the same parameters. Cool Farm was unsuitable for estimating SOC sequestration benefits from compost application primarily because it did not add carbon to the soil pool following amendment. The differences in emissions estimates derived from WaCSE compared with other tools could be attributed solely to its highly constrained input parameters and basis in tier 1 emissions factors. We conclude that online tools can provide rapid estimates of greenhouse gas emissions reduction potential over larger areas or groups of farms but should be used with caution for site-specific estimates. Hence, it is crucial to clarify the intended purpose of an assessment and the designed function of model tools when evaluating their suitability for prioritizing funding for climate-smart agriculture initiatives at the individual farm level.";"2023-12-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623036065";"3";"Emissions"

We include two carbon pricing policies: carbon tax and emission trading scheme (ETS) at national and sub-national (province) levels, measured as policy existence (binary variable) and carbon price (continuous variable). Firms' GHG emissions are measured as total emissions and emission intensity. Using unique recent firm-level data from 2010 to 2021 from three East Asia countries (Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and the People's Republic of China (PRC)), we obtain the following key findings. First, the national carbon pricing policy significantly reduced firms' GHG emissions and GHG emission intensity in Japan and the ROK. The greater the carbon price, the greater the impact. Second, the subnational carbon pricing policies implemented in two provinces of Japan (Saitama and Tokyo) decreased firms' GHG emissions. Third, heavy industry sectors such as energy, utilities, and industrials experienced a substantial decrease in GHG emission intensity due to the carbon pricing policy. Finally, our main results are robust to different model specifications and various measures of firms' GHG emissions.

In the last few decades, massive human activities have been fulfilled by destroying natural resources, and ecological footprint is an excellent way to assess it. Thus, the present study delves into the role of financial development and ecological footprint by controlling urbanization, export diversification, and industrialization. A selected dataset covering 1990 to 2020, containing 43 middle income and 45 high income countries, has been compiled due to data availability. The empirical outcomes were deduced using the Panel Quantile Regression due to outliers and non-normality in the data set. The results demonstrate that financial development suggests the inverted U-shaped curve to determine the ecological footprint in the 25th and 50th quantiles. It shows that a sophisticated financial development declines ecological footprint. Further analysis explores that in middle income countries, only China and higher income countries, Australia, Denmark, Italy, Germany, Japan, France, Korea(R), Netherlands, Luxembourg, Singapore, Switzerland, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States have achieved higher financial development, which started declining their ecological footprint. In addition, Industrialization increases the ecological footprint, while export diversification and urbanization have mixed effects across quantiles and countries. This study suggests that the remaining countries should focus on improving their financial development sector to reduce their ecological footprint.

However, the existing research today is either limited to analyzing the levels of scope 3 emissions or to calculating them based on different measurement methods. How to implement scope 3 emissions reporting by solving the data sharing challenge remains mainly unexplored.

The approach was developed in a prototype that uses real world data from collaboration with the UN-convened Net-Zero Asset Owner Alliance to evaluate its applicability. The findings of the prototype indicate that a digital data infrastructure can improve the calculation of scope 3 GHG emissions by improving data availability, accessibility and reliability and at the same time shows that the calculations are only as good as the data, which fuels this calculation.

In order to make up for this deficiency, we first measured the development level of green finance and the comprehensive score of energy security in China from 2000 to 2020. Then, we constructed a vector error correction model based on the cointegration relationship. The results show a stable cointegration relationship between the long-term variables, and the improvement of the development level of green finance is conducive to ensuring China's energy security. However, from the results of the short-term dynamic adjustment effect, the change in green finance development level has no significant impact on the change in energy security level because the role of green finance has a specific time lag. Further, through impulse response analysis, it is found that when the development level of green finance has a unit positive impact, energy security will produce a first negative and then positive response. The variance decomposition results show that the contribution of green finance to energy security first weakens and then gradually increases. To sum up, the long-term development of green finance will help stabilize China's energy security. Therefore, this study proposes strengthening supervision over green finance, developing “new energy + green finance”, achieving positive interaction between green finance and transformational finance, and enabling green finance with digital technology.

These findings align with previous studies. Nonetheless, we argue that for Latin America, where LUC and deforestation are historical problems, careful consideration of LUC and agriculture GHG sources is necessary to address the potential environmental impacts of trade agreements.

We studied the practical applicability of cleaner production technologies in various regions of China to examine new models of cleaner production for maize cultivation.

India gave its nod to Kigali Amendment, where the phase down of HFCs will take place in four steps from 2032 to 2047. In the present study, the emission scenarios for five majorly used HFCs in India, HFC-125, HFC-134a, HFC-143a, HFC-152a and HFC-227ea, with and without Kigali Amendment are developed. In the absence of Kigali Amendment, the GWP weighted emissions of these HFCs are estimated to increase to 0.16 GtCO2 eq. in 2050 from 0.09 GtCO2 eq in 2020. The Kigali Amendment reduction target for these emissions is estimated to be ∼0.03 GtCO2 eq. in 2050. Except for HFC-134a, the other HFCs have almost zero RF by 2050 in the presence of Kigali Amendment. The atmospheric oxidation potential of HFCs calculated through their reaction with atmospheric OH/Cl radicals reveal that HFC-134a is degraded rapidly in the atmosphere, whereas the oxidation potential of HFC-143a is very low. This leads to a longer lifetime of HFC-143a in the atmosphere. Thus, GWP alone is not a metric in determining the climate forcing properties of HFCs.

In this study, the EKC hypothesis is re-investigated for the United Kingdom for the time period 1850–2018. The objective is to conduct an innovative methodological approach that, contrary to the conventional estimation methods, uses time-varying techniques⸺the time-varying cointegration test of Bierens and Martins (2010) and the time-varying causality test of Shi et al.

It is crucial to evaluate of particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon dioxide (CO2) synergistic emission reduction level and explore its driving factors in China. Using the coupled coordination model, this study evaluated the synergistic reduction emission levels of PM2.5 and CO2 and studied their spatial agglomeration in China's provinces from 2000 to 2018. The spatiotemporal changes of seven driving factors for synergistic emission reduction were studied using geographic and time weighted regression model. (1) The synergistic emission reduction level showed spatiotemporal differences in China. The level presented a trend of first decreasing and then increasing from 2000 to 2018. It was the lowest in the northern coastal economic zone and the highest in the southern coastal economic zone. It had strong spatial aggregation. The High-High aggregation regions were mainly distributed in the northwest and southwest economic zones. There was only one Low-Low aggregation region. It distributed in the northern coastal economic zone. (2) The energy consumption structure played an important role in promoting synergistic emission reduction, while the industrial structure was a key driving factor that hindered synergistic emission reduction.

The purpose of this study is to investigate key drivers of low-carbon practices in green supply chain management in construction industry. Based on institutional theory, relational view theory, and self-determination theory, three drivers for low-carbon practices were identified, namely, environmental regulation, supply chain relationship, and organizational culture. Then a questionnaire was administered and data were collected from the owners, contractors, designers, and other relevant parties of the construction project. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze data. The results show that supply chain relationship and organizational culture are positively and directly correlated with the low-carbon practices level of green supply chain management. In addition, this study also found that organizational culture partially mediates the relationship between supply chain relationship and low-carbon practices. Contrary to expectations, environmental regulation has no direct effect on practices, while supply chain relationship and organizational culture fully mediate the relationship between environmental regulation and practices. As limited research has been conducted to examine the drivers for green supply chain management low-carbon practices in the construction industry, this study bridges the knowledge gap and contributes to the current knowledge system of green supply chain management. Additionally, the findings of this study can provide authorities and practitioners with a deeper understanding of low-carbon practices in green supply chain management, and helping to propose more feasible measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions and improve environmental performance.

This study integrates critical components such as sustainable green innovation in small and medium-sized enterprises(SMEs), industrial agglomeration, and regional innovation into the analytical framework of digital inclusive finance(DIF) and regional carbon emissions. Using China as a case study, we analyze data from 30 provinces (excluding Tibet, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan) between 2013 and 2021, as well as data from 235 prefecture-level cities and microdata from companies listed on the New Third Board. Conducted through the dynamic panel model of the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM), empirical tests reveal that DIF acts as a mitigating factor in regional carbon emissions, with sustained green innovation of SMEs playing a crucial intermediary role. However, enterprises lean towards strategically viable green innovation, which has lower thresholds and higher practicality compared to substantive green innovation. Additionally, our findings show that industrial agglomeration and regional innovation further enhance the suppressive impact of DIF. Heterogeneity tests indicate that deeper and more digitized digital inclusive finance yields superior results in reducing regional carbon emissions, while non-resource-based cities outperform others in terms of carbon emissions. Based on these conclusions, we propose the following policy recommendations: governments should actively promote DIF and encourage green innovation in SMEs to curtail carbon emissions. Further efforts should be made to foster industrial agglomeration and regional innovation, reinforcing their impact on carbon emissions reduction. Raising the bar for green innovation and guiding enterprises towards substantive green practices is crucial, while tailored support should be provided to non-resource-based cities. This study offers valuable insights for policy formulation and green innovation implementation by governments and enterprises alike.

This study uses the panel data of 30 Chinese provinces (municipalities and regions) for the period 2010–2020 to examine the general, long-term, short-term, and threshold effects of public environmental concerns and government environmental concerns on the development of green total factor productivity (GTFP). The method of GML index based on SBM-DDF is employed to measure and analyze the spatial and temporal evolution of China's GTFP. Text mining in Python is adopted to estimate the index of these two different types of environmental concerns. The empirical results show that: (1) GTFP demonstrates a distinct pattern of ""down - up - down"" during the period 2011–2020. (2) Public environmental concern is essential in accelerating the development of GTFP, and it is more significant in areas with higher industrialization and lower environmental pollution. Government environmental concern plays a crucial role in accelerating the development of GTFP, and it is especially significant in areas with lower levels of industrialization and reduced environmental pollution. (3) In terms of long-term and short-term effects, both public environmental concerns and government environmental concerns are essential long-term drivers for enhancing GTFP, rather than short-term ones.(4) Public and government environmental concerns are more effective in promoting GTFP in more economically developed regions. Furthermore, as the intensity of environmental regulation increases, the impact of public environmental concern on GTFP strengthens. Government environmental concerns should be aligned with a higher level of environmental regulation to maximize their contribution to GTFP. The findings above clarify the relationship among public environmental concerns, government environmental concerns, and GTFP, providing a realistic basis for achieving green, low-carbon, and sustainable economic development.

Therefore, it is necessary to study the main impact factors of China's industrial SO2 pollution. Based on China's Industrial Environmental Statistics Database from 2004 to 2013, this paper extends the Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA) with firm entry and exit to conduct a micro-level decomposition study. The industrial SO2 emission in China is decomposed into scale effect, composition effect, firm growth effect, and firm selection effect. Also, we use the Dagum Gini coefficient to analyze the spatial differences of firm growth effect and selection effect between the eastern, central, and western regions in China. This paper finds that the main contribution of industrial SO2 emission control in China is the firm growth effect, which was −103% between 2004 and 2013. And the second largest contribution term is the firm selection effect, which is −18%, while the composition effect is −15%. In terms of temporal patterns, the size of the firm growth effect shrinks as time grows, and the composition effect changes from negative to positive after 2009. For spatial difference analysis, the Dagum Gini coefficient of technique effect and firm growth effect between different regions have become smaller and smaller over time, while the spatial differences of firm selection effect between regions remain unchanged.

This is exacerbated by the well-established connection between economic expansion and increased energy consumption. Because of this scenario of development, rapidly growing health expenditure is a matter of grave concern for households and governments. Every government is compelled to allocate a sufficient budget to improve people's health. Therefore, determinant factors of health expenditure in emerging nation became issue of discussion to understand the direction of further health expenditure. Therefore, major objective this study is investigating the impact of the clean energy transition, energy efficiency, aging population, natural resource depletion, and environmental degradation on health spending in 22 emerging economies for the period of 2000–2019. To fulfil this objective, Fully Modified Ordinary Least square (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Square (DOLS) techniques have been applied. Further to check causality among selected variables, Dumitrescu-Hurlin Granger Causality test has been employed. The outcomes of the Kao co-integration test predicted that a long-run association exists among natural resources depletion energy efficiency, renewable energy, aging population, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions with total health spending, government health spending, and private health spending in selected countries. Further results of FMOS found that the aging population, natural resources depletion, and CO2 release positively influence health spending in selected countries. The study results also indicated that improvement in energy efficiency and renewable energy use decrease health expenditure of emerging countries. Further, these results were also re-confirmed by the DOLS method. Further, the main conclusion of D-H findings predicted that feedback causality exists between environmental degradation and health spending.

The mediating and moderating role of financial development and environmental regulations respectively have been empirically investigated in exploring the relationship of sectoral value-added with greenhouse gas emissions. Our results specified the contribution of an aggressive agrarian strategy to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions associated with agriculture value-added. While investigating manufacturing value-added, the study illustrates a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions due to the use of renewable energy sources, improved energy efficiency, and technological advancements in the manufacturing sector. The services value-added restrained the greenhouse gas emissions on a standalone basis; however, the mediating role of financial development proliferated greenhouse gas emissions that lead to financial enablement to ecologically inauspicious services sectors. Correspondingly, environmental regulations approximated through environmental taxes positively moderated the effect of services valued added on greenhouse gas emissions. This demonstrates that environmental tax alone is not an efficient regulatory tool to drive ecological improvement. These findings are robust to alternative proxy measures and provide an integrated framework for policymakers to rationalize agricultural and service industry processes.

In this work, the feasibility of integrating three alternative CO2 capture units in a cement industry in Greece is evaluated from the techno–economic and environmental standpoint. Two Carbonate Looping scenarios, using CaO– and MgO– based solids as high– and intermediate temperature CO2 capture materials respectively, are compared to the commercial amine scrubbing process which uses an aqueous solution of mono–ethanolamine. The study comprises thorough design of the process flow diagrams, calculation of the mass and energy balances and sizing of the necessary equipment. Using these as basis, the fixed investment and the auxiliaries’ cost are calculated, and a complete economic analysis is conducted for all three configurations. The commercial solvent absorption technology results in a total CO2 capture cost of ∼56 $/tonne, followed closely by carbonate looping with limestone–derived material (60 $/tonne), despite the heavy capital investment for the latter. The life cycle analysis results further support the application of carbonate looping with limestone, which demonstrates 22% lower total environmental impact compared to amine absorption. On the other hand, carbonate looping with magnesite has little benefit for the environment (only 0.64% lower footprint than amine scrubbing), and higher overall cost for CO2 capture (∼80 $/tonne of CO2). Although the implementation of such technologies would lead to increased cement production cost, the strict environmental policies and taxes for CO2 emissions could render these options more attractive in the near future.

Satellite-based carbon monitoring is increasingly instrumental in studying atmospheric CO2 changes, offering a broad spatial view. However, current research lacks a comprehensive exploration of both day-to-day variations in atmospheric CO2 at a finer-resolution grid and its coupled relationship with particulate pollution, owing to a substantial number of missing values in satellite-retrieved CO2 data. To address these issues, this study presents an enhanced regression-based machine learning model, reconstructing full-coverage daily atmospheric CO2 concentrations in China from 2015 to 2020 at a 0.01° spatial resolution. Utilizing spatiotemporal high-resolution column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO2 (XCO2) data from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) as the dependent variable and multi-source environmental factors as independent variables, we achieved overall, spatial, and temporal cross-validation R2 [RMSE] results of 0.98 [0.74 ppm], 0.95 [1.15 ppm], and 0.93 [1.44 ppm], respectively. The resulting full-coverage estimates revealed significant spatial heterogeneity over time, with the highest CO2 levels primarily in spring in the North China Plain, and the lowest in summer in northern China and autumn in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and the south. National weekend averages of mean symmetrized residuals in XCO2 surpassed weekday averages. Within megacities such as Shanghai and Wuhan, industry-intensive areas exhibited higher XCO2 values compared to other urban areas within the same cities. Despite spatial and seasonal fluctuations, the country-average XCO2 increased from 2015 to 2020 but has decelerated recently. A moderate correlation was observed between the spatial pattern of long-term CO2 concentrations and particulate aerosols, viewed from the total atmospheric column perspective, with some regional discrepancies.

However, it has difficulty in using ammonia as a single fuel in actual apparatus due to the low reactivity and slow laminar flame speed. The dual fuel combustion of ammonia and high reactivity fuel is a potential solution, which is expected to address the issues raised by ammonia. Nevertheless, the investigations on the influence of boundary conditions on combustion stability and related mechanisms in dual fuel approach of ammonia and high reactivity fuel are still scarce at present. Therefore, in current study, n-heptane was used as the direct-injected fuel, and the investigations on combustion stability and relevant mechanisms of ammonia/n-heptane dual fuel approach were conducted by using optical diagnostics and chemical kinetic analyses. Results indicate that in n-heptane-only combustion, the premixed blue flames are found in the initial combustion stage. The auto-ignition sites dominated by orange chemiluminescence are generated near the combustion chamber wall in ammonia/n-heptane dual fuel combustion and then the flames develop towards the combustion chamber center. The addition of ammonia inhibits the combustion of n-heptane. The ammonia/n-heptane dual fuel combustion is more sensitive to the change of intake temperature compared with n-heptane-only combustion. The increase of directed-injection pressure from 300 bar to 600 bar and compression ratio from 11 to 14.5 favors the flame development speed. The increase of compression ratio is an effective mode to improve the ammonia/n-heptane dual fuel combustion stability compared with increasing intake temperature and modulating directed-injection strategies. The chemical kinetic analyses indicate that the ignition delay of dual fuel combustion of ammonia and n-heptane is more sensitive to the variations of ambient temperature compared with ambient pressure. Consequently, the changes of ambient temperature on the dual fuel combustion stability of ammonia and n-heptane play a dominant role. In a word, the dual fuel combustion stability of ammonia and n-heptane can be achieved through the collaborative optimization of multiple boundary conditions to reduce the dependence on single factor.

This research delves into the influence of digital inputs on pollution emission reduction in Chinese manufacturing enterprises. The study utilizes a combination of the World Input-Output Database, the Chinese Industrial Enterprises Database, and the Chinese Industrial Enterprises Pollution Emission Database covering the period from 2000 to 2012. The findings reveal that digital inputs make a significant contribution to pollution reduction in Chinese manufacturing enterprises. Specifically, digital software inputs and foreign digital factor inputs display more pronounced effects on pollution reduction. The analysis of the mechanism reveals that the pollution reduction effects of digital inputs in manufacturing enterprises can be attributed to several effective mechanisms: the enhancement of energy efficiency, technological innovation, and servitization, as well as the crowding-out effect of pollution control investment. The former mechanisms demonstrate a promoting effect, while the latter exhibits an inhibiting effect. The impact of digital inputs on pollution reduction in manufacturing enterprises displays heterogeneity, with a more significant emission reduction effect observed in industries facing higher environmental regulatory intensity, digitization-unrelated industries, non-state-owned firms, and firms with higher levels of financing constraints.

To further promote the full implementation of low-carbon city pilot policy, it is highly necessary to clarify the spatial-temporal diffusion process and influencing mechanism of the pilot policy. By taking 277 cities at the prefecture level and above as examples, this study introduces the perspective of dynamic process, and proposes the theoretical hypothesis of policy diffusion based on the analytical framework of “demand driving-pressure response-efficiency measurement”. The results demonstrate that 1) the diffusion of low-carbon city policy in China temporally shows an overall upward trend, but policy diffusion block, deviation, and variation are likely to occur during the process, and it spatially shows obvious adjacency effect, ripple effect, and hierarchical characteristics. 2) The logic for the “demand driving-pressure response-efficiency measurement” analytical framework has an important impact on the diffusion of low-carbon city pilot policies. Among them, the level of science and technology investment has a greater impact on the pilot policies of low-carbon cities. On average, each percentage of increase in the level of science and technology investment will increase the advantage for cities in adopting low-carbon policies by 404788.3%. 3) In the analysis of different stages and regions, each logical variable affects the adoption of low-carbon policies to varying degrees. In terms of different stages, the pressure response logical variable and efficiency consideration logical variable have the most and least significant effect on the adoption of low-carbon policies, respectively. In terms of different regions, the demand driven logic and pressure response logic variables have a greater impact on the central and western regions than on the eastern region. Here, we propose the following suggestions: for cities with different actual needs, the central and local governments should correctly grasp the time node of low-carbon city pilot according to local conditions; it is necessary to reconstruct the assessment system of low-carbon policies, and establish a policy reward and punishment mechanism of combining leniency and tightness in different regions; and pilot cities should establish practical programs with operability and implementation value.

It aims to understand whether substituting fossil-based ethylene with bioethylene contributes to lowering carbon emissions, and in which of the relevant bioenergy-producing regions/countries the valorisation of biofuels as feedstocks would provide a less carbon-intensive bioethylene production. Results indicate that bioethylene production through catalytic dehydration of sugarcane bioethanol in Brazil presents lowest GHG emission. This pathway could deliver up to −2.1 kg CO2e/kg ethylene when accounting for biogenic carbon storage in long-lived applications such as infrastructure. In contrast, beef tallow performs the poorest as a raw material, regardless of whether land-use change (LUC) emissions are considered. When biogenic carbon storage is factored out, none of the pathways outperforms conventional fossil-based steam cracking; however, some are within the fossil-based range indicating potential indirect benefits through reduced refinery utilisation.

It has important practical significance both for energy saving and emission reduction in last-mile logistics distributions, and hence plays an important role in tackling the challenges associated with last-mile and same-day deliveries. This paper investigated the crowdsourcing logistics task assignment problem where logistics platforms can perform multi-stage task assignment. The information of all tasks to be delivered in each stage is known a priori, however the information of crowdsourcing drivers in future stages is not known completely. A multi-stage two-echelon dynamic task assignment model (MS-2E-DAM) was developed for the problem and a heuristic which combines genetic algorithm and tabu search (GA-TS) was developed. Its performance was benchmarked with CPLEX 12.10 for small-size problems and the results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed heuristic approach.

It uses agent-based models (ABM) to simulate multi-threaded and multi-objective construction activities through collecting detailed project data of two case studies (one using the modular integrated construction (MiC) method and the other one using the cast-in-situ method) in Hong Kong. Considering that the construction process is dynamic and site issues are complex in nature, three major environmental impacts of carbon emissions, air pollution and noise are modelled at fine spatial and temporal resolutions. The findings show that the MiC project has significant environmental advantages over the cast-in-situ project in terms of reducing CO2 emissions, harmful emissions (including sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and organic volatile compounds), PM2.5 and PM10 emissions, and noise pollution levels, consequently reducing health risk associated with people in surrounding communities near construction sites. In terms of per square meter of construction floor area (per m2 CFA), the MiC project produced 17.60% less CO2, 42.54% less harmful gases, 32.15% less PM2.5 and 27.41% less PM10.

The scheduling optimization of MCIESs needs to address multiple factors, including solar/wind energy potential, fluctuating load demand, and prediction errors, to maintain its highly flexible and decarbonized operation. This study presents a scheduling optimization model based on a mixed integer nonlinear programming model (MINLP) with a novel flexibility index as the objective function. A case study of a MCIES in a swimming pool in Changsha is provided. The results demonstrate that real-time operational scheduling considering flexibility enhances the system flexibility of the MCIESs from 0.608 to 0.623 comparing with the day-ahead scheduling, maintaining superior performance across multiple dimensions. The coupling between the power grid and the natural gas network is also improved, significantly reducing the carbon dioxide emissions of the MCIES by 127.67kgCO2 per day. Furthermore, the study reveals that the flexibility-aware real-time operational scheduling for MCIES outperforms day-ahead scheduling in responding to weather and equipment failures, sustaining high flexibility operation, economic viability, and notably improved environmental performance. CO2 emissions are reduced by 21.088% and 14.638%, respectively. The proposed operational optimization approach in this study can enhance the flexibility and coordinated operation of MCIESs, leading to reduced carbon emissions.

Various solutions have been proposed to reduce the CO2 emissions from olefins production. It is not clear which solution is best, particularly when you consider other sustainability factors. In this paper we report the results of our cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) of three highly promising solutions: a so-called low-emission steam cracking furnace, the electrically driven RotoDynamic reactor (RDR), and a blue hydrogen-fired furnace. Life cycle inventory data is obtained from a first principles model for steam cracking, validated with industrial data, and combined with data obtained from process simulation. Our study shows that if the electrical supply is grey then the RDR-based cracking process has a 41% higher impact on climate change than the reference base case, a conventional plant with state-of-the-art furnaces. The low-emission furnace is only 7.2% higher. When using a mixed electrical grid, like Belgium's, the climate change impact for the RDR is 1.5% higher and the low emission furnace is 6.6% lower. With a grid that uses fully renewable power generation the RDR solution is an impressive 27% lower than the base case and the low-emission furnace 17% lower. We also analysed the impact of firing the furnaces with blue hydrogen from (a) a conventional steam-methane reformer and (b) an innovative gas-heated reformer: both (a) and (b) using carbon capture and storage (CCS). The climate change impact is reduced by 8% and 18% respectively compared to the base case. Since the blue hydrogen solution uses very little electricity, the climate change impact is insensitive to the method of electrical power generation.

The LCCP policy aims to conserve energy and reduce emissions, inexorably influence many facets of the economic system because it is a well-rounded environmental management strategy.

Using panel data from China's 279 cities from 2002 to 2019, this article employs the difference-in-differences (DID) model to assess the influence of the LCCP policy on urban entrepreneurial activity. Through the results, the LCCP policy generally inhibits entrepreneurial activity. But the level of green innovation can alleviate this inhibitory effect. Based on the heterogeneity analysis, the LCCP policy exerts a more pronounced inhibitory effect on entrepreneurial activity in central and western regions, resource-based cities, and non-central cities.

To fully consider the impacts of the intertemporal dynamics of using the past-formed capital for future production, endogenizing capital as an input into carbon accounting system has been proposed, and lead to the reallocation of emissions. However, little is known about how this reallocation occur, i.e., how carbon flows from the past-formed capital to the products it is used to produce and to the consumers who purchase these products. Here, enabled by a global CO2 transfer network model with capital endogenization, we take China as an example to trace the full process of CO2 spatiotemporal transfer and re-assess CO2 footprints. China contributed more than 40% of the global capital-related CO2 emissions with only 14% of global capital consumption. China drove domestic and foreign CO2 emissions mainly through purchasing service products, while foreign regions outsourced an order of magnitude higher emissions to China by importing products such as electricity, machinery and equipment. Along temporal horizons, CO2 emitted in historical years contributed 87% of the total emissions embodied in China's capital consumption, while new-formed capital contained 5.50 Gt CO2 emissions, which will be attributed to the future. Based on this, China's dynamic CO2 footprint was re-assessed as 4.65 Gt, an increase of more than 1/4 over the traditional results. This increase comes mainly from service products directly consuming building structure, especially real estate and public administration services.

Current modelling techniques provide deterministic, single-point results, which provides a limited assessment of critical asset through-life GHGE where uncertainty can be significant. Furthermore, no modelling technique was identified that relates asset GHGE to Whole Life Cost (WLC) and operational effectiveness, which are both organisational priorities. This leaves decision-makers without robust information regarding the possible impacts of GHGE reduction strategies on the WLC and the operational effectiveness of their critical assets.

As carbon price time series are influenced by time intervals, point value predictions often fall short in capturing the inherent variability within these intervals. Hence, this paper introduces an interval decomposition and integration framework for carbon price prediction based on the interval feedback variational mode decomposition (IFVMD) algorithm and the optimal combination weight prediction model. First, the IFVMD algorithm decomposes the inverted interval-valued sequence through a self-adaptive determination of the decomposition mode number. It then restructures the decomposed modes into interval trends and residuals, scientifically reducing data volatility. Subsequently, within the proposed optimal combination weight model, the Cuckoo Search Optimization algorithm is employed to calculate the weights of subsequences predicted by two models, which merges model features and realizes model complementation. Finally, the results of the prediction are derived by reconstructing the trend and residual interval. The Interval Mean Absolute Percentage Errors (IMAPE) of the model's prediction results are 2.3754%, 3.3773%, and 3.2169%, respectively. These values indicate that the proposed interval combination forecasting technique demonstrates excellent prediction accuracy and stability, and the performance of the proposed model is superior compared to the baseline models. This optimal combination strategy has been proven to be an effective approach for forecasting nonlinear interval-based carbon price time series.

For all PCEs, the main components ethylene oxide, unsaturated acids (methacrylic/acrylic acid) and NaOH were found to be mainly responsible for the entire CO2 footprint. The average total CO2 emissions of the three kinds of PCEs vary between 2.98 ± 0.54 kg CO2/kg (MPEG), 2.48 ± 0.48 kg CO2/kg (HPEG), and 2.40 ± 0.47 kg CO2/kg (IPEG). Evidently, MPEG PCEs reveal the highest footprint which is owed to methacrylic acid whereas HPEG and IPEG PCEs contain acrylic acid. The range of total CO2 emissions is caused by significant differences in the carbon footprints of the electrical grids in various countries. An impact study revealed that at common field dosages the contribution of PCEs to the CO2 balance of a standard concrete (CO2 footprint ∼ 300 kg CO2/m3) varies between approx. 3 and 22 kg CO2/m3 in Europe, with ready-mix type PCEs contributing more than precast concrete PCEs. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that the CO2 footprint of PCE superplasticizers can be reduced by almost 80% if predominantly renewable energy is used in the chemical industry.

However, comprehensive research on the lifecycle carbon emissions of these materials remains scarce, plagued by issues of data uncertainty, accessibility, and scoping discrepancies. Therefore, a probabilistic lifecycle assessment approach was adopted in this study, enabling uncertainty analysis of the carbon emission intensity of magnesium phosphate cementitious materials. The findings indicate that the 10.5th percentile of the carbon emission intensity simulations for MPC stands at 0.624 kgCO2e/kg, suggesting that nearly 90% of the values surpass those of OPC, thereby refuting the presumption of its low-carbon attributes. Notably, the consumption and carbon emission factors of magnesium oxide and soluble phosphates emerge as pivotal influences on its carbon emissions. Additionally, a multiple linear regression model was employed to forecast the correlation between the constituents of magnesium phosphate cementitious materials and the volume of carbon emissions. Through this study, we can have a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental performance of magnesium phosphate cementitious materials in terms of carbon emission reduction, which will provide an important support for the selection and design of future green building materials.

This study uses game theory to explore the pricing and emission reduction strategies of the automotive supply chain under dual-credit policy and subsidy policy (scenario DS), as well as dual-credit policy and subsidy cancellation (scenario DC). This study discusses the effects of dual-credit policy and subsidy cancellation on optimal decisions. The results show that increasing the intensity of dual-credit policy hinders the production and emission reduction of H-type fuel vehicles (FVs). Tougher corporate average fuel consumption (CAFC) standards do not affect L-type FVs; however, they can increase the production and emission reduction of E-type FVs. The more stringent production proportion target of new energy vehicles (NEVs) will limit the production of all types of FVs. Subsidy cancellation reduces the wholesale price of NEVs; however, its effects on the selling price and market size of NEVs are uncertain and depend on their respective thresholds. The government should formulate differentiated dual-credit policies based on different types of fuel consumption. This will ensure that FV manufacturers with different types of fuel consumption can reduce their emissions or increase the production of NEVs. Additionally, the government should ensure a smooth transition before subsidy cancellation to prevent negative effects on the NEV market.

Although existing literature has focused on the relationship between the digital economy (DE) and environmental degradation from the supply side, it fails to incorporate the role of logistics and demand side. This study employs two-way fixed-effects model and two-stage least square method (2SLS) to empirically evaluate the emission abatement effect mechanisms of the digital economy under local logistics development for China's 31 provinces from 2015 to 2019, constructing an integrated framework and narrowing the gaps of existing studies. The empirical results suggest that digital economy growth can have an inhibitory effect on pollution emissions, while logistics development has a negative moderating effect on this impact. These conclusions still hold after a series of robustness tests to eliminate the influence of outliers and regionally differentiated policy interference. Mechanism analysis indicates that technological innovation, changes in industrial structure and consumption structure are significant mediating mechanisms, while logistics development provides indispensable support for the above mediation effect. Hence, this study overall implies that to further unleash the potential of emission abatement effect, adequate attention should be given to exerting the advantages of the digital economy and weighing the green transformation of logistics, enhancing the public's sense of environmental happiness worldwide.

In this context, we propose a two-stage game-theoretical model of competition between firms in prices and green investments. The model delivers several scenarios but two are particularly concerning. One such scenario is called the “dirty” equilibrium, in which firms delay the green transition investments. The other scenario is called the “partial green” equilibrium scenario, in which one firm makes the green transition investments obtaining a leading position, while the other remains producing the “dirty” product. In addition to the associated environmental damages, both scenarios are also problematic because they reduce market competition and the number of firms. In this respect, the “partial green” equilibrium may be even more problematic in the long-run because the green leader may perpetuate its advantage towards some kind of monopoly or market power.

Therefore, renewable energy development is deemed the prime alternative, as it not only curtails CO2 emissions but also stimulates economic prosperity. Hence, there is a need to investigate rational options for renewable energy development. This paper utilises a research framework that combines linear and non-linear modelling. The specific results are as follows. The study's findings reveal that wind, solar and hydro energy can each promote economic growth and lower carbon emissions. Nevertheless, wind energy exhibits the most effective reduction in emissions, followed by solar energy, and lastly, hydro energy. When it comes to promoting economic development, hydro energy proves to be the most effective, followed by wind energy and then solar energy. Additionally, a panel threshold model is utilised to assess further the CO2 reduction for solar, wind, and hydro energy across a range of economic levels. The results indicate a double threshold effect for wind energy, whereby the effectiveness of CO2 suppression initially increases and then decreases as the economic level rises. In contrast, the use of solar power displays a sole threshold effect that incentivizes CO2 emissions at sub-threshold economic levels, yet significantly curbs them beyond it. Similarly, hydro energy also demonstrates a single threshold effect, but lacks statistical significance below the established threshold and actually heightens carbon emissions above it. Our observations can assist in creating sustainable renewable energy development strategies. ";"2023-11-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623032043";"15";"Emissions"

Meanwhile, due to the long production chain, and a wide variety of carbon emissions sources, the C O 2 generated by the production process is difficult to be quantified accurately. To achieve the low-carbon and energy-saving targets, a multi-objective production planning model for the integrated refinery-petrochemical plant is developed in this work. Firstly, an accurate top-down carbon accounting model is established. Then, a multi-aspects process carbon efficiency index is proposed, considering production capacity and energy consumption. A multi-objective production planning model aiming at maximizing total profit and process carbon efficiency is constructed and formulated as a large-scale MINLP problem. Additionally, the FP-growth algorithm is used to analyze the multi-level coupling of emission-material-energy, identifying association and synergy effects. Finally, a case study on a practical integrated refinery-petrochemical plant with a 16000 kilotons annual processing capacity is presented. The results are: (1) Introducing the process carbon efficiency index is able to increase C O 2 emissions reduction potential while ensuring more profit. Specifically, C O 2 emissions are significantly reduced by 10%, and energy consumption is reduced by 289.1 tce after optimization.

It is of great significance to accelerate green production and lead high-quality development. Energy carbon emissions account for 88% of total CO2 emissions, while forest carbon sequestration account for 80% of China's terrestrial ecosystems. In this paper, we analyzed the spatial and temporal evolutions of industrial energy consumption carbon emissions and forest carbon sequestration of Hubei Province, then demonstrated the offsetting effect of forest carbon sequestration on the industrial CO2 emissions. Our results documented energy carbon emissions and forest carbon sequestration in Hubei Province both increased from 2000 to 2020, with the growth rates of 4.9423 Mt/yr and 0.28015 Mt/yr. Forest carbon sequestration could offset energy carbon emissions before 2005, while the offsetting effect was weak due to the continuous increase in industrial energy consumption after 2005. Significant spatial heterogeneity was observed in both energy carbon emissions and forest carbon sequestration. Wuhan had the biggest carbon emission with annual average carbon emission of about 20.046 Mt, while Enshi had the biggest carbon sequestration with annual average forest carbon sequestration of about 14.411 Mt. Spatial autocorrelation between energy carbon emissions and forest carbon sequestration was significant in Hubei Province in the past two decades.

However, long-term use of the DPF can cause a large amount of ash to deposit in it, which can significantly affect its performance. In this study, a burner was utilized to deposit ash, derived from four different lubricating oil additives (zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate (Zn-based), calcium sulfonate (Ca-based), magnesium sulfonate (Mg-based), and composite), into four DPFs with the same specification. The four ash-loaded DPFs and a fresh ashless DPF were subsequently tested for active regeneration on an engine bench at the same soot load. The temperature and particulate emission characteristics of the DPFs were measured using thermocouples and a particulate analyzer. The peak regeneration temperature of ash-loaded DPFs moved forward when compared to the fresh DPF, and the peak regeneration temperature of Mg-based DPF reached 694 °C and moved forward to the axial position of 71.5 mm. A low temperature zone appeared at the rear end of edge channels, forming a large temperature gradient up to 75.5 °C/cm. The emission of nucleation-mode particulates at each DPF outlet increased to different degrees during active regeneration, especially for the Zn-based DPF, whose particulate concentration even approached 108 #/cm3. The X-ray computed tomography (X-CT) images of ash-loaded DPFs showed that the distribution of ash in each DPF was quite different, and ash plugs or bridges appeared in the middle and front of some channels, forming a strong blocking effect. It is due to the presence of ash that the soot deposition position moved forward and the wall-flow velocity rose, which increased the local soot density, causing the peak regeneration temperature to rise and move forward. The increase in wall-flow velocity reduced the diffusion filtration efficiency of ash-loaded DPFs, so escaped particulates that were broken up from soot agglomerate burning increased.

However, the intensive winter wheat-summer maize (WM) cropping system has also led to high carbon emissions. It is imperative to optimize crop rotations to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while ensuring food security. Thus, we conducted a 6-year field experiment in the NCP to evaluate the productivity, carbon footprint (CF), and sustainability of the five rotation systems. These included four 2-year rotation systems: spring maize → WM (WMME), spring millet → WM (WMML), spring peanut → WM (WMMP), and spring soybean→ WM (WMMS), with WM serving as the control. Our results indicated that the 2-year rotation systems significantly reduced GHG emissions and improved agricultural sustainability. Wheat yield following the spring crops was 38.6%–47.5% higher than that following summer maize. The energy use efficiency, energy productivity, maize economic equivalent yield (MEEY), and net income in WMMP were higher by 9.7%, 51.8%, 4.4%, and 15.5%, respectively, compared to WM. This was mainly attributed to the high yield, price, energy equivalent coefficient, and pre-crop effect of spring peanut. The reduction of N and electricity inputs in the 2-year rotation systems reduced on-farm N2O emissions and indirect emissions by 39.0%–56.2% and 41.9%–42.9%, respectively, thus lowering CF per unit area by 25.7%–36.6% compared with WM.

The findings yield new opportunities to delve into the relationship between the externality of people's will and governmental behaviors and provide in-depth insights for decision-makers to develop tailor-made solutions towards carbon reduction and sustainable development.

This study introduces a novel prefabricated subway station structure, characterized by the innovative features of ""Internal support + Large components + Full assembly."" Additionally, the technical processes of the newly designed temporary internal support system for the case station are presented in detail. A greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions quantification model based on construction decomposition is established using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method to assess the low-carbon effect of constructing prefabricated subway stations. Moreover, an integrated project quota GHG emissions inventory is created. The findings demonstrate that the GHG emissions of the full-assembled structure, per unit area, are 6.55% lower than those of the CIS structure, resulting in an emission reduction benefit of 11.21 t CO2e. Notably, structural optimization and reduced material loss rates contribute to an 8.47% decrease in embodied emissions of materials. On average, the GHG emission intensity of the full-assembled station structure during transportation and on-site assembly is higher than that of the CIS structure, amounting to 4.48 t CO2e for a single ring-structure. Regarding GHG emissions during construction, the main structure and the exterior-protected structure of the case station account for 53.62% and 39.24% of the total emissions, respectively. Compared to prefabricated subway station using the temporary anchor cable supporting structure, the temporary internal support system could avoid unnecessary occupation of underground space, which is vital for the sustainable development of underground space in big cities.

However, it is uncertain whether technologies are beneficial in curbing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. To find an answer to this question, the study focuses on four technologically advanced countries (United Kingdom, Switzerland, Norway, Denmark), considers information and communication technologies (ICT), renewable energy technologies (RRD), and economic growth in relation to environmental degradation, and tests the validity of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC). The study applies Fourier approaches and uses data for the period 1989–2020. In this way, the study defines that (i) ICT and RRD are cointegrated with CO2 emissions; (ii) ICT mitigates environmental degradation in the United Kingdom, Denmark, Switzerland, and Norway; (iii) RRD expenditures, however, are not effective in reducing CO2 emissions; (iv) the EKC hypothesis is also validated for the countries studied. Thus, the study highlights the need for countries to rely on further use of ICT and income growth as effective policy instruments to mitigate CO2 emissions rather than RRD.

The basin is known for high levels of coal mine methane (CMM) emissions, posing a serious safety hazard to miners and affecting mine productivity. However, limited data on in-situ parameters related to Coal Mine Methane (CMM) emissions have been available. The study analyzes historical trends in CMM emissions (1980–2020) from the basin's underground coal mines, revealing declining emissions alongside coal production. Over this period, approximately 2.28 billion cubic meters of CMM were released. Continued historical coal production rates suggest a significant 6.63 MWe power generation potential. The investigation into coal production, average mining depth, and coal seam gas content reveal that CMM emissions primarily depend on coal production and mining depth. Utilizing available methane mitigation technologies could prevent an estimated 55.7 million tons of methane annually (equivalent to around 692,000 tons of CO2e). Importantly, the study calculates basin-specific emission factors (ranging from 7.24 m3/t to 21.66 m3/t) based on historical measurements, providing a more accurate regional representation than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) default values. These factors are vital for identifying high-emission areas and guiding emission reduction strategy development. This study addresses a critical data gap in Turkey's estimation of methane emissions from underground coal mining, particularly in the Zonguldak coal basin. It establishes a foundation for future research on methane emissions from coal mines at various scales, contributing to improved understanding, emissions mitigation, safety enhancement, and sustainable coal mining practices.

The study assessed the performance of various biomass sources (sawdust, corn straw, and rice husk) using distinct co-firing ratios (5%, 10%, 15%, 20%) across technological, environmental, and economic dimensions. The findings revealed that in terms of thermal and exergy efficiency, the pyrolysis co-firing approach exhibited lower results compared to direct co-firing. Notably, among the biomasses tested, sawdust demonstrated the least impact on boiler efficiency. The CO2 emission was estimated by the Life Cycle Assessment method. The emission of the conventional boiler, along with direct and pyrolysis co-firing of corn straw at a 20% ratio, resulted in CO2 emissions of 1.075 kg, 0.954 kg, and 0.942 kg per 1kWh of electricity, respectively. The different feeding methods were also discussed, providing technically and economically rational options for coal-fired power plants. The economic feasibility of both co-firing systems was also proposed. At carbon tax rates of 410 CNY/t and 464 CNY/t for the direct co-firing and pyrolysis co-firing models respectively, the operational cost of the co-firing systems becomes comparable to that of a coal-fired boiler. However, when the by-product price exceeds 3700 CNY/t, the pyrolysis co-firing model becomes the more economically favorable option. This study primarily concentrates on investigating the real-world application and effective utilization of biomass co-firing systems within the specific framework of China's energy scenario.

Such strong market shocks can also affect the environment, for example, through changes in the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity of production. The purpose of this study was to calculate and evaluate comparable GHG emission intensity indicators for food production systems and their production stages in European Union (EU) countries. An index decomposition analysis of the obtained indicators was conducted to determine the structural and intensity effects. The three original contributions of this analysis were index decomposition of emission intensity, consideration of more GHGs, and expansion of the study period to include 2018–2020. The results from the majority of countries confirm the research hypothesis that the emission intensity at the agricultural (on-farm) production stage in EU countries in 2020 increased in relation to the emission intensity of the remaining stages of the food production system. The overall emission intensity of food production systems increased from 0.83 CO2-eq per 1 GDP in PPP in 2019 to 0.86 in 2020. However, this was caused solely by the increase in emission intensity at the agricultural production stage, from 2.40 CO2-eq per 1 GDP in PPP to 2.65 in 2020. On average, emission intensity did not increase at other stages of the food production systems in EU countries. Our findings indicate the low market resilience of agriculture to the 2020 economic turmoil, causing the low market power of agricultural producers in relation to the remaining stages of the food production value chain. These results were confirmed by the higher intensity index and lower structural index between 2019 and 2020 in the majority of the analyzed countries, caused by the decline in the share of agriculture in the GDP structure of food production, with a simultaneous increase in its intensity over time.

The results indicate when producing 1 kg of hydrogen, deep IGCtH requires 349.55 MJ of external primary fossil energy input and generates 30.47 kg CO2-eq of emissions, which are 24.88% and 16.32% lower than 465.34 MJ and 36.41 kg CO2-eq of Lurgi surface gasification based coal-to-hydrogen (Lurgi SGCtH), and also 7.38% lower than 377.39 MJ of coke-oven gas-to-hydrogen (COGtH). Furthermore, deep IGCtH can not only reduce coal consumption by 19.7% compared with Lurgi SGCtH, but also reduce oil consumption required to obtain process energy by 81.84%, which also reaches 80.09% compared with COGtH. Due to the high methane content, the exhaust gas and flue gas of deep IGCtH contributes 9.78 kg and 8.84 kg of CO2 emissions, and under the CO2 capture rate of 80%, the carbon emissions adopting exhaust gas and flue gas simultaneous capture reach 25.88 kg CO2-eq, higher than the 23.1 kg CO2-eq adopting exhaust gas single capture, of which waste gas only contributes 3.87 kg of emissions, but electricity consumption causes 15.11 kg CO2-eq of emissions, indicating the key to adopting such scheme to achieve further emissions reduction lies in reducing emissions caused by electricity consumption.

The search for alternative materials used in concrete is becoming a prominent measure to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the construction industry. Cement in concrete produces 4–8% of all GHG emissions annually worldwide. Alternative materials such as waste cardboard provide an opportunity to be utilised further in such applications. This study focuses on using nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to optimise the economic cost and GHG emissions of concrete incorporating recycled waste cardboard as a partial cement substitute. The multi-objective optimisation solutions produced three key regions that corresponded with trade-offs between the lowest costs, carbon emissions or a combination of both. Region 1 was the most economical but created the most carbon emissions. Region 2 was a compromise between both economical, and environmental factors and region 3 demonstrated the lowest carbon emissions but also produced the highest costs. These regions produced three mix designs which were experimentally analysed for their compressive strength. The results indicated a cost increase of 17, 27 and 36% for three key optimised regions. This is primarily due to increased material costs and further manufacturing requirements when converting waste cardboard into kraft fibres (KFs). Increasing the amount of KFs then reduced the compressive strength from 36 to 56%. However, there was a 7, 18 and 28% GHG emission saving when KFs partially replaced cement.

Assessing the current carbon emission status and predicting future carbon emission scenarios could help formulate effective regional carbon emission reduction targets. However, it is necessary to enhance the carbon sink capacity of terrestrial ecosystems and improve forest management methods to promote greenhouse gas absorption. In this study, the spatiotemporal characteristics and dynamic evolution of fossil fuel CO2 (FFCO2) emissions in China from 2000 to 2019 were analyzed using the standard deviation ellipse, kernel density of emissions, and Theil index. A backpropagation (BP) neural network optimized with a genetic algorithm (GA) was used to predict FFCO2 emission during 2020–2030. The biomass increment methodology was used to predict the potential carbon sinks generated by Chinese Certified Emission Reduction (CCER) carbon-sink forestry projects during 2020–2030. The results showed that China's FFCO2 emissions exhibited a gradual increasing trend during 2000–2019, with an average annual growth rate of 6.29%. China's FFCO2 emissions show a greater distribution on the southeastern coast than in the northwestern interior. The GA-BP prediction shows that China's FFCO2 emissions will continue to fluctuate and increase between 2020 and 2030. The potential of carbon sinks will be 0.69 × 108 Mg C generated by the CCER carbon-sink forestry projects during 2020–2030, which could offset 0.56% of FFCO2 emissions. In the future, imbalances in regional development should be considered when formulating carbon-reduction strategies.

Quantifying the carbon footprint of all the major food categories in different continents is critical for accurately evaluating various aspects of GHG emissions from food production on a continental and global scale. Such information, however, is lacking. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis of plant-based and animal-based food production in all continents comprehensively using 5353 carbon footprint values from 524 published papers and calculated GHG emissions from food production (system boundary is from cradle to farm gate) at the continental and global scale. Our results indicate that the average carbon footprint of plant-based foods amounts to 0.66 kg CO2-eq kg−1, which is only 10.7% of animal-based foods (6.15 kg CO2-eq kg−1). The carbon footprint of plant-based food in Asia and Europe is 8.9%–184% higher than that of other continents. Africa has the lowest carbon footprint for plant-based foods, owing to its low agricultural input and limited crop management. However, the carbon footprint of animal-based foods in Africa and Asia is 2.5%–150% higher than that of other continents, with North America and Oceania recording the lowest. Total annual GHG emission from global food production reached 8125 Mt CO2-eq, with grains, meat, and milk together accounting for 70.8%.

To address the potential privacy leakage problem when using multisource industrial big data for carbon emission prediction, a federated learning method was introduced for carbon emission prediction research. However, owing to the variability in individual data providers, using all clients indiscriminately to train the federated model may hinder the computational efficiency of federated learning. To improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of the prediction model, a federated learning method based on SARIMA clustering was proposed. First, a trend was fitted to all clients based on the SARIMA model and the clients were grouped into different clusters based on the fitting results. Second, a federated bidirectional long short-term memory calculation was implemented for different client combinations using a federated averaging algorithm. Extensive experimental results on real datasets show that combining SARIMA and the federated averaging algorithm protects the data privacy of clients and improves the convergence speed and accuracy of the federated learning carbon emission prediction model.

By combining the multi-region input-output analyses with the panel regression model, the current paper examines the GVCs' influence on GTFP in 93 BRI countries during 2002–2018. Furthermore, the mediating effect model recognizes the impact mechanism of GVCs. The results showed that the GVCs position caused the GTFP to increase by 33%, as evidenced by the common correlated effects mean group (CEMG) estimator.

Understanding these interconnected drivers is crucial for effective decarbonization policies. To address this issue, this study integrates extended input-output analysis, material flow analysis, and CO2 accounting to quantitatively assess the relative impacts of these drivers within the energy–material–economy nexus.

To clarify the effectiveness of de-carbonization pathways, here we identify coupled factors documented across a range of studies and connect them in a coupled system framework. The empirical analysis reveals the de-carbonization significance and potential of coupled variables in the GBA. These potentials can be decisive for determining policies and emission outcomes. After in-depth spatial and time-fixed analysis, spatial spillover effects of driving factors are identified. And the driving effect of the independent variable is further decomposed into direct effect and indirect effect to show a complex coupled correlation. The novelty of this study is that it explores the coupled correlation among driving factors and quantitatively verified these relationships.

Given that the dynamic impact of CID on CV evolves over time, this paper continuously investigates this time-varying relationship within the functional framework. Based on the continuous curves smoothed from 65 companies in the Shanghai Stock Exchange Social Responsibility Index, we construct an evaluation index using functional entropy weight to continuously measure the level of CID. Furthermore, to quantify the time-varying effect of CID on CV, we use functional regression to visualize its dynamics in symbol, strength, and statistical significance from 2009 to 2021. Finally, the real-time moderating effects of nature of ownership and industry attributes are also examined, revealing how the impact of CID on CV varies across different companies and periods. The results suggest the following: (1) CID adversely affected CV initially but favored later. (2) The initial negative impact and the subsequent positive impact of CID on CV are stronger in non-state-owned companies than in state-owned companies. (3) These impacts are also stronger in low-polluting companies than in high-polluting companies. In summary, this paper expands the research toolset for exploring the dynamic effect of CID on CV and offers practical implications for companies to make informed disclosure decisions.

News is a crucial channel to draw society's attention to this issue and strengthen climate governance initiatives, such as carbon emission reduction. The aim of this research was to investigate the effects of carbon-related news on carbon emissions and carbon transfer. First, we analyzed the topics of carbon-related news from media outlets such as ABC, CNN, and The Guardian from 2009 to 2019. Then, we calculated the carbon emissions from both production- and consumption-based perspectives and constructed the carbon transfer network of major countries around the world. Finally, we examined the direct and lag effects of carbon-related news attention and contents on carbon emissions and carbon transfer by using the extended population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model as the analytical framework. The results showed the following. First, countries are paying increasing attention to carbon-related issues with the rise of global carbon emissions, and they mainly focus on the social aspects of carbon emissions. Second, there are differences in production- and consumption-based carbon emissions by country. The amount of embodied carbon transfer between countries has increased over time and the carbon transfer network has become tighter. Finally, carbon-related news has a positive impact on improving carbon emissions and carbon transfer worldwide. Different news topics have also shown varying effects on carbon emissions and carbon transfer. In summary, this study further revealed the impacts of carbon-related news on carbon emissions and transfer and accordingly provided policy implications in carbon emission reduction for the government.

This research delved into the potential of hydrogen to mitigate carbon emissions, employing a hydrogen-rich blast furnace model for calculations. A novel approach for preheating hydrogen through blast furnace injection was proposed, accompanied by a more scientifically rigorous CO2 assessment method. This approach encompassed not only CO2 generation during blast furnace smelting but also factors in CO2 emissions from the hot blast stove and hydrogen preheating stove. Simulation outcomes underscored the significant carbon reduction potential of hydrogen. However, it's noteworthy that introducing preheated hydrogen into the blast furnace didn't guarantee lower CO2 emissions. For hydrogen volumes below 300 m³/THM, CO2 emissions rose as hydrogen temperature increased. Conversely, when hydrogen injection surpasses 300 m3/THM, elevated hydrogen temperatures correspond with decreased CO2 emissions. The most significant reduction in CO2 emissions, amounting to 26.1%, occurred when hydrogen at 1250 °C was blown at a rate of 350 m³/THM. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of hydrogen's potential for emissions reduction, underscoring the importance of intricate factors in optimizing its implementation in the blast furnace smelting process.

In addition, we compares the carbon emission intensity of PV modules manufacturing with the manufacturing industry as a whole, and analyzes the carbon emissions transfer in the import and export. The result shows that the unit emissions value of Chinese PV modules is 342,892 tons of CO2 per GWp, and the industry's carbon emissions were 42,724,343 tons and 62,406,344 tons in 2020 and 2021, respectively, and the carbon emission intensity of China's PV modules manufacturing is only 72.03% of that of the manufacturing industry as a whole. This would represent that China's PV manufacturing industry is not a high-energy consumption and high-emission industry. In 2020 and 2021, the net transferred carbon emissions of China's PV products through import and export were 28,508,597 tons and 33,861,939 tons, respectively, and accounted for 66.6% and 54.3% of the total emissions from the industry, respectively, meaning the PV manufacturing industry has not caused excessive pollution to the domestic market through import and export trade.

Ingredient lists for 23,550 packaged products were systematically disaggregated and a linear program was used to estimate ingredient proportions in each product. Ingredient-specific, cradle-to-farm gate GHGe values were identified from five life cycle assessment data sources. Weighted GHGe values for each ingredient were summed up to a product-specific GHGe estimate that was then additionally adjusted for processing and transport-related emissions to account for most attributable emissions from cradle-to-retail. To assess validity, GHGe for food categories, estimated as the median of product-specific GHGe estimates, were compared against existing GHGe values for analogous food groups. The included products contained 897 different ingredients for which GHGe values were determined using data from 433 life cycle assessments. The estimated median for cradle-to-retail GHGe for all products was 2.35 kg CO2eq/kg product (interquartile range, IQR, [1.24, 4.53]).

Owing to the lack of fossil carbon data and suitable estimation models, CO2 emissions generated from sludge combustion and biodegradation are considered carbon-neutral according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), increasing the inaccuracy of GHG emissions accounting. Therefore, this study aimed to build a new comprehensive assessment model to accurately evaluate GHG emissions from four typical sludge treatment and disposal approaches. Notably, fossil and biogenic carbon migration were considered, rather than the emission factor method when measuring direct GHG emissions. The results of 14C analysis, which quantified the contributions of fossil and biogenic carbon to the sludge samples, showed significant differences in the average fossil carbon fractions among the four types of sludge: 84.11% for chemical sludge, 25.99% for tannery sludge, 79.19% for textile dyeing sludge, and 45.97% for municipal sludge. According to our model, the route of safely landfilling deep-dewatered sludge possessed the highest GHG emission factors of 1.18–3.75 tCO2eq/t dry sludge. The optimal sludge treatment option was anaerobic digestion followed by land application. This treatment maintained a low and stable level of GHG emissions (0.48–0.54 tCO2eq/t dry sludge) and exhibited low sensitivity to changes in fossil carbon fraction and carbon content according to the sensitivity analysis results. For sludge with a high calorific value and a low fossil carbon fraction, the route of dry incineration + utilization of ash and slag as building materials was carbon-negative and more suitable than anaerobic digestion to achieve carbon neutrality. This study complements the fossil carbon data gaps of sludge in the IPCC Guidelines and provides a more accurate GHG emissions accounting model, which will support the sludge treatment industry in developing effective strategies to reduce GHG emissions.

To date, the high computational cost of accurate models has inspired the development of numerous tradeoff approaches; however, none of them is fully satisfactory. To address this gap, we herein theoretically and experimentally explore the key design and layout factors influencing TWC performance under transient driving conditions, starting with the optimization and verification of a simplified reaction mechanism. This mechanism is used to construct a semidecoupled posttreatment GT-Power model featuring boundary conditions derived from experimental and upstream engine modeling results, and experiments on a real engine are carried out to evaluate the model accuracy. The performance of three posttreatment systems is analyzed to identify the key performance-affecting parameters, and the following conclusions are drawn. (1) For a single reactor, cell density is the most important factor influencing pressure loss. (2) The exhaust temperature rapidly decreases in the longitudinal direction of the reactor in the initial start stage, although the reaction rate always decreases in this direction during the whole cycle. (3) One-dimensional plug-flow reactor simulations do not account for inhomogeneity and local turbulence, thus overestimating the performance of large reactors. (4) Under the employed conditions, the exhaust temperature is sufficiently high for pollutant conversion, although the efficiency of this conversion often decreases in the high-speed stage. Moreover, we show that high-speed adaptation can be enhanced by increasing the crosswise size of the reactor and propose a new reactor structure. Compared with our model, this structure is characterized by a lower catalyst loading and NO x conversion efficiency but achieves higher hydrocarbon and CO conversion efficiencies. Thus, our study provides a useful and effective method for evaluating the design/layout of posttreatment devices and facilitates the development of more efficient TWCs, contributing to the establishment of a more ecofriendly society.

Sectors such as aviation, refining industries, and transportation face increasing pressure to reduce their reliance on fossil fuels. To achieve this, the promotion of energy efficiency and renewable energy solutions, which have often been overlooked in environmental studies, have become crucial. In this context, the current study aims to assess the environmental impacts of gas efficiency and oil efficiency in Japan. The data used for this evaluation spans from 1990/Q1 to 2020/Q4. Moreover, the roles of environmental innovation and renewable energy are considered in the study. To investigate these interrelationships, the study relies on various quantile-based approaches, including quantile-on-quantile regression, cross-correlation analysis, recursive cross-quantilogram correlation, quantile cointegration, and quantile causality. The findings obtained from the quantile regression and quantile-on-quantile regression approaches indicate that both gas and oil efficiency promote the reduction of CO2. Similarly, across all quantiles, environmental technological innovation and renewable energy positively promote ecological quality by mitigating CO2. Furthermore, the quantile causality analysis reveals a significant causality in both mean and variance from gas efficiency, oil efficiency and environmental technological innovation to CO2, although the strength of the causality is relatively weak in the mean. Additionally, the results from the time-varying recursive cross-quantilogram correlation provide evidence of significant correlations between CO2 and its determinants in the 0.1, 0.5, and 0.90 quantiles throughout the study period.

However, the consumption behavior of consumers has brought a significant impact on the earth's environment. For this reason, some governments or organizations are constantly calling for environmentally friendly consumption behaviors, trying to change people's consumption habits through a series of intervention measures. However, researchers can hardly track each consumer's behavioral changes and inner thoughts in real-time, so it is challenging to quantify the effect of intervention measures. This study considers three factors: consumer behavior, morality and self-esteem, and intervention measures to estimate the carbon emissions caused by consumption behavior. Firstly, the carbon emissions are estimated through the existing behavior of consumers. Secondly, the morality and self-esteem of the respondents are evaluated through the process of moral dissonance and the self-esteem scale. And then we investigate the change of consumers' carbon emissions under the intervention measures. Finally, the adjusted final result is given by combining morality and self-esteem. Through a series of surveys on 354 respondents, this study estimated that their average annual carbon emissions without intervention were 5.3 tons, and their average yearly carbon emissions after intervention were 4.365 tons. After considering the intervention of moral disorder and self-esteem, the average annual carbon emission is 4.691 tons.

The model considers carbon tax regulation to reduce supply chain operations' emissions. To comply with this regulation, the manufacturer invests in green production technologies and replaces the existing (conventional) facility with a green facility. Thus, the manufacturer can benefit by implementing a hybrid production system involving the simultaneous operation of a conventional and a green facility. The green facility requires higher production costs than the conventional facility, but its emissions are lower. The demand is stochastic and the average demand rate is influenced by the product selling price and green investment level. The goal of this research is to determine the optimal delivery lot, number of shipments, safety factor, selling price and investment level in order to optimize the joint total profit. An efficient algorithm is proposed to solve the problem and a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model. A sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of the model's key parameters on its behavior. The results show that green investments made by the manufacturer can effectively reduce the total emissions generated from the supply chain and increase the product's selling price.

In order to understand the variabilities, we explore the relationship among airfare (a proxy for price-based policies), passenger demand, airline capacity decisions, and resulting aviation emissions on several air routes originating from a small and a large airport in the US Midwest. Using a supply-and-demand model, emissions are found to be inelastic to airfare overall, although they appear to respond to airfare tenfold more at the small airport compared to the large one. This inelasticity suggests that price-based measures will have low efficacy towards directly reducing aviation emissions, despite their role in generating financial resources for supporting various carbon removal and reduction technologies and processes. Given that the studied airports are only about a 2-h drive apart, the aforementioned emissions' response variability show that studying and designing price-based policy instruments at national, continental and global scales, as done extensively thus far, may mask significant regional variations.

The Kaya identity and multi-scenario simulation were employed to predict the dynamic evolution pathways of CO2 emissions from 2021 to 2035 and explore the differential CO2 peak time, peak value, and reduction potential for 13 cities in BTH. Monte Carlo simulation, Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen's slope estimation method are jointly used to reduce uncertainties in estimation. The Monte Carlo simulation results show that most cities in BTH have already reached their CO2 emissions peak, while Tianjin, Langfang, Cangzhou and Tangshan are expected to reach their peaks between 2025 and 2030. Among them, 5 and 8 cities have the risk of not reaching their peak before 2035 in the high consumption scenario (HCS) and extensive development scenario (EDS) respectively. Comparative analysis reveals that low-carbon scenario (LCS) and sustainable development scenario (SDS) have significant effects on emissions reductions. The top three cities in terms of accumulative emission reduction in 2021–2035 are Tianjin, Tangshan and Cangzhou, estimated as 117.82–250.75 Mt CO2 in LCS and 217.77–454.10 Mt CO2 in SDS, respectively. The results of sensitivity analysis reveal that the most critical driver of CO2 emissions in Beijing is population, while that is GDP per capita for Tianjin. Langfang and Hengshui showed the highest sensitivity to energy intensity. Accordingly, these cities have differentiated concerns and priorities to achieve their carbon peak goal as scheduled.";"2023-11-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623031037";"16";"Emissions"

Thus, a framework for assessing life-cycle GHG emissions for clean hydrogen pathways is necessary. In this study, the comprehensive datasets and effects of various scenarios encompassing hydrogen production, carriers (liquid hydrogen, ammonia, methylcyclohexane), carbon capture and storage (CCS), target analysis year (2021, 2030) to reflect trends of greening grid electricity and potential import countries on aggregated life-cycle GHG emissions were presented. South Korea was chosen as a case study region, and the low-carbon alternatives were suggested for reducing aggregated emissions to meet the Korean standard (5 kgCO2e/kgH2). First, capturing and storing nearly entire (>90%) CO2 from fossil- and waste-based production pathways is deemed essential. Second, when repurposing the use of hydrogen that was otherwise used internally, applying a penalty for substitution is appropriate, leading to results notably exceeding the standard. Third, for electrolysis-based hydrogen, using renewable or nuclear electricity is essential. Lastly, when hydrogen is imported, in a well-to-point-of-delivery (WtP) perspective, using renewable electricity during hydrogen conversion into a carrier and reusing the produced hydrogen for endothermic reconversion reaction are recommended. By implementing the developed calculation framework to other countries' cases, it was observed that importing hydrogen to regions having scope of WtP or above (e.g., well-to-wheel) might not meet the threshold due to additional emissions from importation processes. Additionally, for hydrogen carriers undergoing the endothermic reconversion, the approach to reduce WtP emissions (reusing produced hydrogen) may conflict with the approach to reduce well-to-gate (WtG) emission (using external fossil-based fuel). The discrepancy highlights the need to set a broader scope of emissions assessment to effectively promote the life-cycle emission reduction efforts of hydrogen importers. This study contributes to the field of clean hydrogen GHG emission assessment, offering a robust database and calculation framework while addressing the effects of greening grid electricity and CCS implementation, proposing low-carbon alternatives and GHG assessment scope to achieve global GHG reduction.";"2023-11-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623030652";"9";"Emissions"

The model considers carbon tax regulation to reduce supply chain operations' emissions. To comply with this regulation, the manufacturer invests in green production technologies and replaces the existing (conventional) facility with a green facility. Thus, the manufacturer can benefit by implementing a hybrid production system involving the simultaneous operation of a conventional and a green facility. The green facility requires higher production costs than the conventional facility, but its emissions are lower. The demand is stochastic and the average demand rate is influenced by the product selling price and green investment level. The goal of this research is to determine the optimal delivery lot, number of shipments, safety factor, selling price and investment level in order to optimize the joint total profit. An efficient algorithm is proposed to solve the problem and a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model. A sensitivity analysis is performed to evaluate the impact of the model's key parameters on its behavior. The results show that green investments made by the manufacturer can effectively reduce the total emissions generated from the supply chain and increase the product's selling price. Furthermore, a hybrid system operated by the manufacturer is proven to control costs and emissions, especially in situations in which the replacement of production facilities must be performed gradually based on the available investment budget.

In order to understand the variabilities, we explore the relationship among airfare (a proxy for price-based policies), passenger demand, airline capacity decisions, and resulting aviation emissions on several air routes originating from a small and a large airport in the US Midwest. Using a supply-and-demand model, emissions are found to be inelastic to airfare overall, although they appear to respond to airfare tenfold more at the small airport compared to the large one. This inelasticity suggests that price-based measures will have low efficacy towards directly reducing aviation emissions, despite their role in generating financial resources for supporting various carbon removal and reduction technologies and processes. Given that the studied airports are only about a 2-h drive apart, the aforementioned emissions' response variability show that studying and designing price-based policy instruments at national, continental and global scales, as done extensively thus far, may mask significant regional variations. Replicating this more localized approach on airports in different regions of the US as well as other countries may yield a range of insights about where price-based environmental policies could have efficacy and to what extent.

However, the academic intellectual foundation is still far from maturing, not only because of its novelty but also because scholars have focused on narrow topics and theoretical lenses. Thus, this paper aims to understand the present intellectual structure of BSRs in low-carbon supply chains (LCSCs) while showing the lack of knowledge and the need to investigate research topics through multiple theoretical lenses. In this study, a literature review was conducted by collecting data without date restriction in July 2023 and analyzing 804 peer-reviewed articles from top-ranked academic journals. Both quantitative and qualitative methods were applied for the paper's content analysis, including a multiple correspondence analysis and a homogeneity analysis of variance by means of alternating least squares (HOMALS) to map the data. The results show a high degree of fragmentation within the present theoretical foundation of BSRs in LCSCs, including a limited application of theoretical lenses and the need for a balanced research agenda. Based on the assessment of the existent literature, 29 research propositions are presented and they are categorized under eight theoretical lenses that constitute the interpretive framework. This study contributes to building theoretical knowledge of supply chain management 1) by analyzing the present intellectual foundation while mapping investigated research topics and theories in a two-dimensional graph and 2) by proposing a balanced research agenda with 29 research propositions to develop the field of BSRs in LCSCs.

So, it is considered multidimensional and is not easily determined by a single factor. As such, the study constructs a composite index of energy poverty (EPI), engaging multiple indicators based on their logical relevance from the literature. Adopting EPI as the dependent variable, the study discovers the theoretical links between various factors of education, financial development, and technological innovations in EPI between 2000 & 2018 for a global panel of 77 countries. To this end, robust econometric estimators “Continuously Updated and Fully Modified (CupFM) and Continuously Updated and Bias Corrected (CupBC)”, along with the Generalized Method of Moment (GMM), are applied. The estimates imply that education in all its forms is conducive to reducing energy poverty. In line with education, technological innovations and economic growth are explored to be the drivers of reducing energy poverty in these countries. However, financial development and infant mortality increase energy poverty. A feedback hypothesis is explored between technological innovations, financial development and infant mortality, whereas education forms a one-way causal link with energy poverty.

While previous studies have primarily focused on improving technology performance in steel production processes, the potential CO2 reduction through material efficiency strategies for steel demand management remains largely unexplored. To bridge this research gap, this study aims to quantitively assess the co-benefits of CO2 reduction from implementing energy and material efficiency strategies along China's steel flow chain. By integrating dynamic steel flow analysis with a CO2 accounting model, this model traces energy use, material flows, and CO2 emissions along the steel flow chain, then evaluates the CO2 reduction potential of implementing various mitigation strategies by 2060, and finally quantifies the relative contribution of each strategy. The findings indicate that the coordination of energy and material efficiency strategies can reduce CO2 by more than 80% from the business-as-usual level by 2060. In particularly, the strategies of more recycling, longer lifetimes, and energy efficiency improvements are projected to contribute −68%, −43%, and −11% of CO2 reduction, respectively, even amidst an expected +29% rise of CO2 emissions driven by economic growth. The study can provide more promising options for decarbonizing China's iron and steel sector and lays the foundation for future analyses that seek to integrate demand-side material efficiency strategies in China's steel decarbonization modeling.

Previous studies have explored the possibility of ship integrated energy systems that use alternative fuels for emission reduction in a cost-efficient manner. However, the various navigation loads and strict space limitations of ships are usually overlooked when designing the ships' energy systems. To fill this gap, a two-stage optimization model is proposed for designing ship integrated energy systems that incorporate alternative fuels, which incorporates internal combustion engines, fuel cells, energy storage technologies, and other relevant equipment. The model captures the ship's volume and weight limitations for alternative fuel applications, and a large cruise ship sailing in Oceania and the Caribbean is selected as a case study.

Meanwhile, alternative fuel applications are economically competitive when compared to conventional diesel power systems, considering the growing technology readiness level of fuel production and fuel cells.

The hybrid energy supply stations are promising energy facilities that can provide charging services for plug-in electric vehicles and refilling services for hydrogen fuel vehicles. This paper studies electricity and carbon allowance sharing among community microgrids integrated with hybrid energy supply stations from a new perspective. The main objective of this work is to reduce the communication overheads when implementing distributed energy and carbon allowance management for microgrids, rather than merely protecting the privacy of microgrids as other studies have done. Thus, a communication-censored alternating direction method of multipliers-based communication-efficient distributed algorithm is proposed for solving the electricity and carbon allowance sharing problem in a distributed manner. Moreover, an adaptive penalty coefficient selection method is introduced and integrated into the communication-censored alternating direction method of multipliers for improving the convergence performance of the distributed algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed mechanisms for sharing electricity and carbon allowance among microgrids can result in a 50.18% reduction in the total operation cost and a 13.70% reduction in the total carbon emissions, compared to the scenario where such sharing is not implemented. In comparison to the alternating direction method of multipliers, the proposed distributed algorithm can reduce the total communication overhead by 46.47%.

Urban expansion frequently coincides with heightened carbon emissions, releasing substantial quantities of greenhouse gases such as CO2. This exacerbates the urban heat island (UHI) effect and poses a threat to urban living conditions. To shed light on the intricate relationship between land surface temperature (LST) and carbon emissions and provide novel insights into the synergistic regulation of “heat” and “carbon” in sustainable urban development, we conducted an in-depth investigation of the Wuhan Urban Agglomeration spanning from 2003 to 2018. Employing data on impervious surface fraction (ISF), LST, and carbon emissions, we harnessed weighted center and standard deviation ellipse analyses to explore the spatiotemporal expansion patterns of ISF, LST, and carbon emissions. We examined the relationship between LST and carbon emissions using spatial correlation analysis. The results revealed that regions with high carbon emissions and elevated LST were predominantly concentrated in the central urban areas of each city, aligned with the distribution of high-density impervious surfaces. The weighted centers of ISF, LST, and carbon emissions exhibited a progressive shift toward the central region of Wuhan, intensifying spatial clustering effects. The global Moran's I index for LST and carbon emissions increased from 0.33 in 2003 to 0.48 in 2018, signifying a strong positive correlation between LST and carbon emissions. In the clustering maps of LST and carbon emissions, the high-high clustering trend persistently expanded, signifying a shift from “dispersion” to “agglomeration” in urban heat and carbon effects. In regions marked by consistent carbon emission growth, the correlation coefficient (R) between carbon emissions and LST was 0.4, and the Pearson coefficient was 0.64, both higher than those in areas with gradual carbon emission growth. Within stable carbon emission growth areas, every 0.1-ton increase in carbon emissions has a 40% probability of a 1.33 °C temperature rise. As the rate of carbon emissions increased, the positive synergistic effect between carbon emissions and LST continued to increase.

Prior studies have only considered individual factors, such as the scale and structure of urban land use (ULU), without accounting for its multidimensional evolution. To address this limitation, we analyzed data from 44 cities around the Bohai Sea between 2000 and 2020, developing a land-use index system that includes urban land quality. Our results present a nuanced view of the urban land use patterns (ULUPs) in the Bohai Rim region over the 20-year period. We found that all indices of ULUPs demonstrated a trend of improvement. Specifically, the structural pattern index (TS) was typically high, with values ranging between 0.65 and 0.80. The quality pattern index (TQ) witnessed the most significant growth. In contrast, the scale pattern index (TA) and the layout pattern index (TP) registered a relatively lower and slower-paced growth. Simultaneously, we observed an intriguing pattern in the CEs in the Bohai Rim region - an initial surge was followed by a considerable slowdown, as the growth rate plummeted from 88% to a mere 3%. There were noticeable regional variances, with the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region registering a lesser increase compared to the Liaodong Peninsula. As our study progressed, we uncovered distinctive and evolving influences of the land use morphology factors on the Bohai Rim region's CEs. A progressively rising number of factors emerged as significantly influential, with their suppressive impact on CEs becoming increasingly potent. Notably, land allocated to public service facilities, green spaces, and squares was found to be associated with reduced CEs. Moreover, our study reveals a clear link between quality optimization of ULU and effective restraint on CEs, whereas larger scales of urban land result in increased CEs. Our findings also show that a continuous and stable optimization of the multidimensional pattern of urban land, accompanied by a relatively stable optimization path, can favorably suppress CEs. This confirms the critical role of strategic land use management in controlling CEs.

Circa 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the livestock industry originate from beef, milk and pork production. Changing the production and consumption of meat and dairy products is considered to offer an important contribution to achieving the Paris Agreement climate targets (UNFCCC, 2015), and could reduce the import of soybean meal to Europe from countries where it is linked with deforestation. However, individual diet substitutions may have indirect and unintended environmental consequences across interlinked livestock systems – hence a wider assessment of impacts of consumption changes is required using consequential life cycle assessment (LCA). In this study, we investigated the environmental consequences of two independent yet interconnected diet choices in a German context: (i) replacing dairy milk with soy milk, and; (ii) replacing beef meatballs with pea protein balls. We related commodity demand to detailed agricultural rotations and land use changes via farm scale economic modelling coupled with consequential LCA. The substitution of beef meatballs with pea-derived protein balls can result in GHG savings of 2.4 kg CO2e per 100 g serving, and up to 7.3 kg CO2e per 100 g serving if spared land is afforested. Environmental problems related to nutrient leakage such as acidification and eutrophication are also mitigated. Meanwhile, unless accompanied by dramatic reductions in beef consumption, the substitution of cow milk with soy-based milk does not lead to significant GHG mitigation owing to the displacement of dairy-beef production to less efficient suckler-beef systems. Nonetheless, land sparing by cow milk substitution could support overall GHG mitigation if combined with afforestation. This study confirms that legumes can play an important role in diet transitions towards climate neutrality, especially via substitution of meat (as opposed to dairy) products.";"2023-10-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623029840";"21";"Emissions"

For this purpose, the study extends the NARDL model to the PNARDL (Panel Nonlinear Autoregressive Distributed Lag) model, which facilitates the control of asymmetric effects and nonlinearity in the panel data model. In this context, this study is one of the first studies to control the nonlinearity in panel data analysis. The results from the PNARDL model demonstrate that renewable energy has a positive long-term relationship with economic growth in G7 countries; however, this relationship is statistically insignificant.

The system is used to evaluate the linkage changes in contaminant emissions reduction across different sectors, the ease of regulation, and the returns on emissions reduction efforts. The study's results demonstrate that firstly, COVID-19 initially reduced contaminant emissions across almost all sectors, although this effect waned over time. Secondly, applying conventional regulatory measures to sectors with high reductions in contaminant emissions may not yield the expected results. Thirdly, while some sectors may be more difficult to regulate, they may offer a higher return on investment in terms of emissions reduction. Based on the above results, the paper advocates for timely measures to consolidate environmental gains, prevent rebounding of contaminant emissions, prioritize supervision and management of easily regulated sectors, prioritize upgrading of cleaner production in sectors with high reduction efficiency indices, and increase investment in environmental technology.";"2023-10-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623030457";"9";"Emissions"

Hydrogen, as a carbon-free, high-density, and secondary energy source, can be obtained on large scales during the petroleum refining process as industrial by-product hydrogen (IPH). In this work, the IPH is firstly used and tested in the spark ignition (SI) engine. In, addition, the impacts of operating and controlling parameters on the performances of the SI engine fuelled with IPH are investigated and compared with the engine fuelled with gasoline. The experimental results indicate that the CA 10 and CA50 locations of the SI engine fuelled with IPH initially advance and then retard with increasing load. Meanwhile, its brake specific gas consumption decreases, while the brake thermal efficiency (BTE) increases. The results demonstrate that NOx emissions of the test SI engine fuelled with IPH increase, while the CO and HC emissions reduce with increasing the load and remain relatively low under medium load conditions. The optimum spark timing of the SI engine fuelled with IPH achieves a balance between the BTE and emissions. In addition, the combustion phasing of the SI engine fuelled with IPH advances and its combustion duration shortens compared to the test gasoline engine. Additionally, the SI engine fuelled with IPH outperforms the gasoline engine in terms of fuel economy, and its BTE increases by 15.39% and 11.58% under loads of 2.5 bar and 5 bar, respectively. Compared to the gasoline engine, the NOx emissions of the test SI engine fuelled with IPH slightly increase while its CO and HC emissions are reduced by more than 90%.

Utilizing the methane released during the mining process through effective coal mine methane (CMM) control technologies can provide triple benefits in terms of safety, energy, and the environment, thus contributing to carbon neutrality goals. However, few studies evaluated the status and benefits of CMM control. In this study, we quantify emissions, statistical extraction, and utilization of CMM to evaluate the current status of CMM control in China. Gas accidents, avoided coal consumption, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions, and carbon trading revenues were used as indicators to assess the contribution of CMM controls to China's carbon neutrality goals. The results show that a total amount of 22.86 Tg methane was generated in 2020, of which 7.26 Tg was extracted, and out of that extracted amount, 5.46 Tg of methane was effectively utilized. Since 2005, CMM control has effectively ensured the safe production of coal mines, and the CMM utilized can replace 53.21 million tons of standard coal consumption and reduce GHG emissions by 958.55 TgCO2e. Furthermore, if methane were strategically included in carbon trading markets, it could generate 52.26 billion CNY in revenue.

Promoting sustainable foreign direct investment (FDI) can help improve carbon productivity. As a result, the need to assess the severity of FDI components on sustainable economic growth as the world economy interoperates and expands is imperative. Using 30 Chinese provinces, the study investigates the impact of FDI components on China's CP from 2006 to 2020. The spatial model is utilized in this study to assess the interactive influence of these components on CP. It was found that, while CP is significantly influenced by inbound FDI (IFDI), its spatial spillover impact is not significant. Conversely, outbound FDI (OFDI) negatively affects local CP, as well as significantly reduces CP through spatial spillover in nearby regions. Also, the developmental coordination of IFDI and OFDI significantly enhances the country's CP, primarily due to positive spatial spillover effects. There exists a regional heterogeneity exhibited by the influence of both IFDI and OFDI on CP. In the eastern region, the IFDI has a negative impact on CP. However, OFDI possesses a positive effect on CP in the eastern region and an adverse influence in the western, southern, and northern regions. These results together with the policy implications will provide great insights into encouraging green investment from foreign countries.

However, there is limited knowledge on the comprehensive development level, evolutionary trends, and driving factors of these two systems in the YRB. To address this, the study uses multiple methodologies, including nighttime light data, the entropy-topsis method, the coupling coordination degree model (CCDM), exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA), and the geodetector model, to examine the coupling coordination relationship and driving factors between CEI and HQED across sixty cities in the YRB from 2010 to 2019. The results reveal a decreasing trend in CEI and a “U”-shaped development trend for HQED, characterized by low coordination and significant spatial imbalance. Moreover, per capita GDP, population density, urbanization level, industrial structure, and energy intensity are found to have significant driving effects on the CCD. Based on the results, the study suggests policies to boost the CCD between CEI and HQED. These involve promoting green transitions, endorsing spatially tailored development strategies, and implementing interventions on major CCD drivers for balanced growth. It also proposes refining regional governance and establishing an innovation fund for green technologies, particularly beneficial for underdeveloped regions. These policy implications could guide economic development and emission reduction strategies in ecologically fragile and economically underdeveloped regions.

However, research into regional transport of PM2.5 at a smaller spatial scale such as district is limited. In this study, a novel combined method was constructed to simulate and identify the regional transport trajectories and potential sources of PM2.5 concentrations at district scale, based on a hybrid model that integrates the Bayesian maximum entropy (BME) model, Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) and backward trajectory model. Take Tianjin as an example, an analysis of the transport trajectories showed that the air masses from northwest and southwest were the dominant atmospheric transport pathway in all seasons except summer. The number of transport trajectories from northwest and southwest accounted for 42.41% and 40.75% of the total number of transport trajectories. Despite the dominant wind direction in winter was northwest, it can be beneficial to atmospheric transport. This was because northwest trajectories were the long-range pathways, corresponding to fast-moving air masses that facilitate the dispersion of pollutants. On contrast, it is noteworthy that the southwest trajectories were the short-range pathways, resulting in limited diffusion and unfavorable conditions. The major potential cities that were likely contributors of PM2.5 (Weighted Concentration-Weighted Trajectory (WCWT) values greater than 40 μg m−3) were situated in the southwest. Furthermore, the inter-district transport results indicated that the primary direction of PM2.5 transport in Tianjin was also from south to north. It is critical that the current layout of Tianjin is adjusted in a timely manner through relocating or phasing out, as the majority of industrial enterprises with severe air pollution in Tianjin are located in the southern districts. This method of combining BME, WRF and backward trajectory can be used for atmospheric environment planning in other similar city and district-scale around the world. It also provides useful insights to policy makers when they formulate pollutants prevention control policies.

Textual analysis is employed to quantitatively evaluate the extent of these two variables. The findings reveal that external environmental regulation exerts a positive impact on both corporate greenization input and output, whereas corporate environmental commitment only significantly enhances the output. Moreover, notable substitution effects are discovered between external environmental regulation and corporate environmental commitments concerning the greenization output. Further heterogeneity analysis uncovers that such substitution effects are predominantly observable in non-state-owned firms and those with relatively lower levels of pollution.

This paper proposes a novel self-adaptive fractional order grey generalized Verhulst model (SAFGGVM) to predict energy-related carbon emission intensity in China, America, India, Russia, and Japan with nonlinear and complex characteristics effectively. Firstly, self-adaptive fractional order and dynamic background value coefficient are introduced to capture the nonlinear evolutionary trends. Subsequently, the optimal nonlinear parameters are determined using Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm through comprehensive comparison. Furthermore, the flexibility of SAFGGVM is verified by presenting its relevance to existing models. Finally, the validity, applicability, and robustness of SAFGGVM are confirmed by comparing with two machine learning models and four grey prediction models. The empirical results exhibit that the overall precision of SAFGGVM model significantly prevails over the others in five cases, with MAPE values less than 6% in both the simulation and prediction intervals.

These three denitrification industries have become the main potential fixed sources of ammonia emissions in urban areas, however the studies on ammonia emissions are lacking. In order to study the ammonia emission characteristics and ammonia injection control of gas-fired power plants, cement plants and municipal solid waste incineration power plants, field tests were carried out on five typical denitrification enterprises using three monitoring methods. The multi-form ammonia manual monitoring method proposed in this study distinguished and defined all possible ammonia in the flue gas into filterable ammonia, residual ammonia, condensable ammonia and gaseous ammonia according to the migration and transformation behavior during the collection process. The monitoring results of the multi-form manual monitoring method can more accurately reflect the actual ammonia emission level with the simultaneous collection and monitoring of different ammonia forms. The ammonia emission levels in cement plants (more than 20 mg/m³) were higher than that of gas power plants and waste incineration plants (almost less than 4 mg/m³). The condensed ammonia was the dominant form of ammonia, accounting for 58.4%～88.7%. The humidity and temperature of flue gas at the chimney outlet had significant influence on residual ammonia. For the denitration enterprises using a single denitrification technology, the ammonia emission had a linear negative correlation with that of nitrogen oxide with changing ammonia injection amount, while for that using combined denitrification technology, the degree of collaboration between selective non-catalytic reduction ammonia injection control and selective catalytic reduction ammonia injection control played a decisive role in the control of nitrogen oxide emission and ammonia emission, especially the selective catalytic reduction ammonia injection control.

We also discuss the influencing factors affecting carbon emission efficiency using the spatial econometric model. The results indicate that: (1) China's manufacturing industry is not very efficient in terms of carbon emissions. The Eastern region exhibits a significantly higher level of performance than the Central and Western regions in carbon emission efficiency and production technology, although the gap is gradually narrowing. (2) The potential for reducing carbon emissions in China's manufacturing sector is considerable, with the greatest potential found in the Western region. Specifically, in the Eastern region, the carbon reduction potential is largely associated with management inefficiency. However, in the Central and Western regions, excessive carbon emissions are mainly due to technology gap inefficiency.

Thus, the goal of the present study is to establish the environmentally optimal time in which to replace a petrol car, in five substitution scenarios that include a newer version of this car, a diesel car and an electric car. The average occupancy, annual mileage and the energy mix on the market for electricity were addressed in this approach. This research quantifies the GHG emissions from the selected vehicles, with the aim of determining the optimal number of years after which substitution should take place, by way of a novel contribution to the current literature. The results show that the base vehicle can be efficiently replaced after 8.88 years if an electric car is selected as the substitute. However, this period would decrease to 6.55 years if the new vehicle were powered with 100% renewable energy. Moreover, an environmentally optimal replacement could be made at 3.29 years, if the substitute were an electric car run with an average occupancy of 3 passengers and a 100% renewable energy mix. It was also demonstrated that the EURO 5 diesel car could be a replacement option for the base vehicle after 13.65 years, considering GWP impacts exclusively. By contrast, there are no environmental benefits related to diesel cars when considering PM2.5 emissions, hence they are not a feasible environmentally optimal substitution. This article concludes that the substitution could be up to 69.94% sooner if a cleaner energy mix is used to run the replacement car.";"2023-10-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623028196";"6";"Emissions"

Carbon taxes are an energy policy tool for substantially carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions reduction. This paper proposes a new strategy to promote the use of renewable energy by enterprises in industrial parks against the backdrop of a carbon tax. Using an evolutionary game model based on life cycle assessment (LCA), this study investigates the impact of dynamic carbon tax mechanisms, fines, and subsidies on the energy choices of industrial park enterprises. This paper's primary contribution is the incorporation of LCA into the evolutionary game model, which facilitates accurate calculation of the carbon tax parameter value. According to the study's findings, the carbon tax rate increases the propensity of enterprises to acquire a high percentage of renewable energy. While there is a negative relationship between fines and the propensity of enterprises to adopt a low proportion of renewable energy, an increase in subsidies decreases the proportion of enterprises that purchase a high proportion of renewable energy. This paper concludes by providing a theoretical foundation for policymakers to construct precise carbon tax schemes and promote renewable energy consumption among industrial park enterprises while simultaneously reducing carbon emissions.

We present a framework for examining how travel time, distance, purpose, frequency, weather, and demographics affect passenger usage and estimate environmental benefits. The framework comprises modules of association rules, density-based spatial clustering, random forest, and CO2 emission estimation. Our findings show that commuters with a trip distance of 1–2 km are more likely to change their behavior patterns. Therefore, more CO2 emission savings accrue in developed districts where residential density and employment rates are higher, than in central districts. Beijing saves 4322.38 kg CO2 per day. In contrast, four districts are oversupplied and have reached saturation points in the number of bikes.

Numerous countries are engineering ambitious programs to map and project the mitigation potential of wind energy expansion to combat future global warming. Here, using the global installed wind capacity data, we identity that a total of 837 GW of wind energy installed capacity (WEIC) in 31 countries generated about 2186 TWh of electricity, that is 1311 Mt of CO2 mitigation, in 2021. Considering power mix transformation, wind power could account for more than 30% of total global electricity generation by the mid-21st century, when many countries expect to realize carbon neutrality, and could reduce CO2 emission up to 14871 Mt by 2050 and 32864 Mt by 2100. Meanwhile, the global phenomenon of the future southward shift of wind energy resources makes the wind energy development in low-latitude countries, such as Brazil, Vietnam, and Central African, more confident. Combined with the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs), we find that the mitigation benefits of wind energy expansion are significant and will directly reduce global warming by up to 0.64 °C by the end of the century (NZE deployment scenario, SSP3-7.0). For China and the United States, the share of renewable energy will reach 78% and 84% by 2050 (APS scenario) and the cumulative climate mitigation by wind power will be 0.12 °C and 0.11 °C during 2020–2100, respectively. The findings strongly support the development and practice of global climate mitigation energy solutions.

In this paper, a novel method for vehicle path planning is investigated, which incorporates environmental regulation to determine the transportation path, driver, and vehicle type in a joint manner. The mathematical formulation of the investment decisions related to internal self-regulation is provided, considering four external regulation policies. To address the challenges posed by the multidimensional, discrete, and non-linearity model, an improved dynamic disaster genetic algorithm with elite strategy (ED-GA) is proposed. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ED-GA in solving large-scale path planning problems, considering both effectiveness and running time. Moreover, this paper analyzes the variations in internal environmental regulation and external environmental regulation, elucidating the impact of different degrees of internal regulation and exploring the applicability of various external regulations. The proposed method is particularly relevant for freight enterprises that possess their own vehicles and are committed to investing in emission reduction.

To spur CFPUs release flexibility, this paper suggests a two-stage optimal model, taking into account various peaking compensation mechanisms (VPCM) in a day-ahead power and carbon emissions trade (CET) joint market. Pre-clearing is the first stage, which maximizes social welfare, and formal clearing is the second stage, which maximizes the profit of the coal-fired power system. In contrast to the existing fixed peaking compensation mechanism (FPCM), the variable and fixed costs associated with providing peaking regulation are calculated by the VPCM. In addition, the work considers the CET market as an external carbon emissions constraint and internal constraint and no constraint are set to study the effectiveness of the current CET market. The result indicates that the VPCM can adapt more successfully to the cost of CFPUs when providing peaking regulation and increase the profit of the coal-fired power system. Then, “VPCM + external carbon constraint” enables larger profits for coal-fired power systems, whereas “FPCM + internal carbon constraint” stimulates VRE integration and reduces carbon emissions. Finally, the current CET market mechanism is insufficient to support coal-fired power plants in reducing carbon emissions as VRE rises.

The vessel pollution prevention ability is effective in preventing vessels from discharging mass emissions. Thus, it is of great value to figure out the vessel's performance in pollution prevention in this area. This study develops a data-driven Bayesian network model focusing on vessel performance in pollution prevention in port state control (PSC) inspections in the GBA. The Tree Augmented Naïve and Expectation Maximisation approaches are applied to learn structures and parameters based on the inspection records obtained from January 2015 to September 2022. An analysis can identify key variables with significant effects on vessel performance in pollution prevention and clarify the positive influence and contributions of PSC inspections toward carbon neutralisation achievement. Practical implications are provided to foster port authorities and local governments in the GBA to minimize the vessels with poor pollution prevention performance sailing in this area. The study also identifies the characteristics of vessels with poor performance and proposes valuable suggestions to restrict the inattentive actions of ship owners and stimulate ship owners to put more effort into the improvement of pollution prevention ability. Further, the study reveals the significance of executing efficient and reliable PSC inspections in promoting carbon neutralisation progress.

However, there is still a lack of comprehensive understanding regarding its impact on driving behavior, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions. In this study, we used heavy-duty diesel truck (HDDT) as an example and conducted a comprehensive path study from the changes in driving behavior to fuel consumption and CO2 emission reduction after the application of GLOSA, using a portable emission measurement system for real-world driving tests at two research scales: signal-controlled road section and signalized intersections. The study was innovatively conducted in three scenarios: Without GLOSA, With GLOSA, and GW GLOSA, which considers the simultaneous application of Green Wave (GW) traffic control system. Results show that applying GLOSA, the passing rate of vehicles at signalized intersections significantly improves, the driving cycle curve tends to be smoother, the cruise time ratio increases to 67.60%, and the travel time is reduced by 5%–13%. HDDT's average speed on the road segments (Seg) decreases by 25.15%, and the aggressive acceleration and deceleration behavior near signalized intersections are significantly reduced. The trip fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of HDDT decrease by 16.63%–23.51% and 16.06%–24.12%, respectively. These fuel savings and CO2 emission reductions mainly occur in the Seg and Signalized intersection-after sections. After the simultaneous application of GLOSA and GW, the trip average speed increases by 60.90%, and traffic efficiency is greatly improved. Although the fuel consumption and CO2 emissions are slightly higher compared to GLOSA alone due to the higher driving speed, GW GLOSA still offers relatively considerable fuel and environmental benefits. This study deepens people's understanding of GLOSA and GW and provides support for the formulation of transportation efficiency improvement and environmental protection strategies.

To mitigate climate change, government imposed carbon emission reduction obligations to industries with high greenhouse gas emissions. These entities performed carbon accounting and participated in emission trading systems annually to acquire enough carbon emission allowance and carbon credit to compensate for their greenhouse gas emissions. However, current carbon accounting methods did not account for their long-term emission potential, undermining assessment for their sustainability and financial risk. The proposed method addressed this issue by considering carbon emission allowance and carbon credit as carbon asset and emission potential from life cycle and embodied carbon assessment as long-term liability. Double-entry accounting methods were used to introduce carbon accounting balance sheet, income statement and flow statements and to enable carbon management performance analysis by analogous methods on financial statements. A case study was performed with historical data of an emission trading system. The result revealed that an entity's future carbon emission potential imposed significant long-term liability and risk. Its relevant emission expense was also found to incur much earlier before the actual emission. But more research was needed to expand the method to entities with their carbon neutrality targets, to enable comparison of entities in different emission trading systems and to ensure data credibility in generated reports.

Bioenergy is foreseen as key option to meet future energy demands and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, however its sustainability depends on locations and regional characteristics. Simultaneously, agricultural production models that co-produce food, feed, and energy offer sustainability synergies and co-benefits, but site-specific sustainability assessments of their large-scale implementation are missing. This study presents a bottom-up approach to assess spatially explicit sustainability aspects of bioenergy-livestock integrated systems (BLI) in Brazil and shed light on their contribution to future energy demands, to climate change mitigation targets, and their impacts on selected ecosystem services, including bioenergy production, climate change mitigation, reduction of food competition, biodiversity conservation, and avoided deforestation. The proposed integration considers livestock intensification and use of biofuels by-products as animal feed supplement, taking advantage of synergies between these two value chains. The expansion of the BLI system in the Center-South region of Brazil produce up to 89 billion liters of ethanol, enough to meet future domestic ethanol demands from multiple shared socioeconomic pathways and generating surpluses for export.

To further improve the prediction accuracy, we proposed a novel road vehicle emission model that integrated the machine learning method and the MOVES to predict the road-level emission rates of NO and CO2 emissions of LDGVs. In addition, we employed the Boruta algorithm to capture the key influencing factors and promote prediction performance. The enhanced model outperformed MOVES and achieved higher R2 values. On average, the improvement for CO2 was 0.132, and for NO, it was 0.261. This work will provide references for MOVES improvements in practical scenarios and better predict pollutant emissions for LDGVs using limited resources of field tests in cities outside the US.

Evidence from a quasi-natural experiment ";" Financial policy is an essential tool for achieving sustainable economic development and has been extensively studied in the environmental economics literature. This study employs panel data of 45 countries from 2007 to 2019 and a multi-period difference-in-differences (DID) method to investigate the mechanism and transmission path of negative interest rate policy on carbon dioxide emissions. The results indicate that the implementation of negative interest rate policy can significantly reduce CO2 emissions, and various robustness tests substantiate this result. Mechanism tests show that when the interest rate breaks the zero lower bound constraint, CO2 emissions can be reduced through the exchange rate channel, while the credit channel is blocked. Furthermore, the mitigation effect of negative interest rate policy varies with country heterogeneity, and countries with low comprehensive development, high economic growth, and high investment levels have more potential to control environmental degradation. The study evaluates the effects of negative interest rate policy from an environmental perspective, providing useful policy insights for monetary authorities to formulate effective policies to promote coordinated economic and environmental development.

A scenario-based multi-criteria decision-making approach";"The choice of heating system is significant for city planners and building owners alike, and many important areas, such as the well-being of residents, climate change impact and resource efficiency, may influence the choice. Understanding how to balance these areas is crucial for effective decision-making that can contribute to sustainable development and the green energy transition. However, these decisions represent complex problems where disparate knowledge areas must be considered simultaneously. When faced with this type of decision-making problem, employing different multi-criteria decision-making methods is common. However, such methods only provide a snapshot of which alternative is preferred and because of this, their results may become obsolete due to changes in the performance of alternatives or the value perceptions of the decision-makers. To overcome this challenge and to improve the longevity and reliability of multi-criteria decision-making results, the authors of this study explored a novel approach to producing semi-dynamic results through scenarios, which were used to consider possible future changes to the alternatives' performance and the decision-makers’ value perceptions. The application of scenarios in the multi-criteria decision-making method enabled nuanced information to be produced on how the performance of different heating alternatives may change under different plausible futures. This approach was demonstrated by applying it to the case of residential heating in Denmark, where results showed that while final rankings varied across both scenarios and ranking methods, solar heating was the preferred alternative, while the oil boiler alternative performed the worst. Overall, this study highlights the importance of considering likely future changes to both the performance of alternatives and the value perceptions of decision-makers when making decisions with long lifetimes and suggests an approach for doing this.";"2023-10-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623025568";"12";"Emissions"

This carbon budget is rapidly decreasing, with a high probability of it getting exhausted in the coming few decades. The extensive use of non-renewable resources has resulted in a rapid depletion of the global carbon budget. Currently, there is a lack of studies assessing the long-term impact of various sectors on the rapidly decreasing global carbon budget. The recent budget estimates have further reduced by 200 GtCO2 in the past decade, creating conflicts among the nations towards getting a higher share of the remaining budget. This study focuses on allocating the global carbon budget to a sub-sectoral level for India's iron and steel sector. First, the global carbon budget is allocated using different approaches, giving India a range of carbon budgets. Further, the allocation is done to the sectoral and sub-sectoral levels to obtain the benchmark targets between 2020 and 2050 from the national carbon budget. Projections have been made for the production capacity and the expected emissions till 2050 for India's iron and steel sector using three scenarios based on specific CO2 emission reduction. The results indicate that the carbon emissions for the “specific CO2 emission stagnation” scenario for 2 °C temperature target are 66% to 726% above the benchmark carbon budget allocated to the iron and steel sector using different allocation methods. The study also shows the benchmark carbon budget of the iron and steel sector for the 2 °C, 1.7 °C, and 1.5 °C temperature targets will deplete between 2023 and 2046 for the different emission scenarios.

In addition, the production and use of biodiesel made from waste cooking oil provide a solution to environmental issues and waste management, achieving a circular economy. Nevertheless, biodiesel usage in NRMMs in Hong Kong is largely limited to public works and the current biodiesel promotion and regulation measures are inadequate. This study aims to review and analyse biodiesel policies and promote the use of biodiesel in Hong Kong for low-carbon construction. Incentive and mandatory policies applicable to NRMMs are reviewed and analysed for two stages: biodiesel production and supply, and biodiesel consumption. Recommendations on biodiesel policies for the construction industry in Hong Kong are made accordingly, including expanding biodiesel production through incentives, and encouraging contractors to use biodiesel in private projects. A lifecycle analysis is then conducted to quantify the carbon reduction capability of using biodiesel. It is estimated that a lifecycle reduction of 3.2 × 104 tCO2e, i.e., a 4.5% decrease could be achieved by using B5 waste cooking oil biodiesel instead of diesel in the construction industry of Hong Kong. This study reviews and analyses biodiesel policies clearly and critically, paving the way for the establishment of feasible and effective regulations for promoting biodiesel use for low-carbon construction.

A sensor placed in the centre of Craiova, Romania, provides a two-year dataset for training, testing, and validation phases. The analysis identifies the most important predictor variables for PM prediction and forecasting. The coefficient of determination (R2) values in this stage exceeded 0.95 (95%), indicating a strong correlation between PM concentrations. The performance of the proposed models is evaluated by objective measures, including root mean squared error (RMSE) and standard deviation (σ). RMSE ranged between 0.65 and 1 μg/m3, while σ has values between 2.75 and 4.1 μg/m3, reflecting a high level of precision and a successful performance of the proposed models. Furthermore, 13 multivariable-based PM models are developed in this study and adjusted using a hybrid Least Square - Decision Tree approach. The R2 values for these adjusted models range from 0.66 to 0.75, while the RMSE and σ vary between 8 and 9.1 μg/m3.

However, the use of such indicators remains limited in the construction industry, particularly in developing countries, partly because of their complexity, high cost, and fragmented life cycle assessment (LCA) tools. Therefore, we have developed the Information System for Environmental Performance in Construction (Sidac) to change this scenario. The system applies a streamlined LCA approach for assessing the cradle-to-gate embodied energy and CO2 emissions of construction products. This online system includes all functionalities to consistently calculate, verify, communicate, and benchmark life cycle indicators. Based on primary data, the system is intended to facilitate the calculation and disclosure of life cycle indicators for construction products. This paper presents the principles and primary functionalities of this system. The first version of the system database contains generic data for 86 Brazilian construction products and 40 basic inputs, including electricity and fuels, and it is ready to receive manufacturer-specific data. By addressing barriers to assessing life cycle indicators of construction products, Sidac represents an important step towards the mainstream consideration of these indicators in the Brazilian construction value chain. This system can aid public policy in promoting low-carbon construction by providing a centralized and reliable environmental performance information system. Moreover, the development of Sidac is aligned with the trend of increasing digitalization and simplification of LCA. This system can serve as a model for developing similar simplified tools to accelerate the adoption of life cycle thinking in other countries and sectors.

This study focuses on the Apple industry’s supply chain network problem and emphasizes the importance of environmentally friendly transportation systems. To address this concern, a multi-objective mixed-integer transportation model is developed to maximize profit by considering revenue and rewards for lower CO2 emissions while simultaneously minimizing costs associated with purchase, loading, unloading, transportation, fixed expenses, CO2 taxes, and penalties for exceeding permitted emission levels and reducing overall carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the AFSCN. Uncertain parameters, including revenue, purchase cost, loading cost, unloading cost, reward, fuel consumption, and CO2 emissions for different fuel-type vehicles, are handled using type-2 picture fuzzy numbers for accounting for uncertainty. The data and information used in this study were acquired from a survey conducted among Apple industry wholesalers in Shimla, Mandi, and Kothkai in Himachal Pradesh, providing authentic and reliable insights on supply chain network dynamics. The proposed multi-objective model is solved using LINGO 19.0 optimization software, utilizing diverse optimization methodologies, including the weighted sum method, fuzzy goal programming, interactive fuzzy satisfying technique, global criteria methodology, and weighted Tchebycheff metrics programming. This enables decision-makers to make informed choices and optimize the AFSCN’s problems on economic and environmental performance. Additionally, sensitivity analysis is conducted to evaluate the model’s resilience and responsiveness to changes in the carbon budget, carbon cap, and CO2 emission sources.

An interaction algorithm and generalized Nash game are thus applied in this work. With the simulation results, we find that the daily disutility of provincial systems is reduced by about 7 ¥ when time-of-use electricity rates are applied. This pricing strategy can encourage prosumers to participate in energy-sharing transactions. The subsidies of electricity rates, carbon prices, and renewable energy investments can improve the social welfare of the whole system. Considering the development of power generation technology and emission reduction targets, the change of optimization parameters in the next 30 years is analyzed in the example. It can be concluded that the total CO2 emission in 2050 will be reduced to almost half of that in 2020 in the energy-sharing markets.

In this system, exiting product gases from the combustion chamber undergoes a CO2 capture process utilizing LNG regasification to avoid CO2 emissions to the atmosphere. Since biomass has a lower emission rate compared to fossil fuels and is subject to easier replacement and conversion, this system is considered to have a zero CO2 emission rate. LNG is the only cooling medium in this system; no exterior fluid like water is used to cool the system, making the overall process more environmentally friendly. This present system offers a unique structure utilizing renewable technologies for future zero-emission power layouts with sustainable and clean commodities such as green energy and hydrogen. A parametric study for this system is performed and results of energy and exergy analyses are presented to depict a better view of the system's performance and its advantages. The system includes a gas Brayton cycle as the main cycle, a LNG expander, as well as one steam Rankine and three organic Rankine cycles as bottoming cycles.

This paper innovatively applies system dynamics (SD) to the study of CLI prediction and unlocking path, and systematically constructs an industrial CLI SD model, trying to break the positive feedback mechanism of CLI through multiple causality and feedback chains. This paper simulates and predicts the changing trend of the CLI level of China's industry and 8 major subsectors from 2020 to 2050. At the same time, the random forest algorithm is used to select the regulatory variables of policy analysis. Compared with the previous research methods, the accuracy and objectivity of the selection of regulatory variables are improved, so as to test the effectiveness of the unlocking path under each scenario. The results show that (1) the whole industry faces a serious CLI problem and is still in a deep lock-in state. From the perspective of subsectors, the light, electromechanical, and textile industries have achieved unlocking; the oil and extractive industries are in a moderately lock-in state; the chemical, steel, and power industries are in a deep lock-in state; and the CLI situation is serious.

But to what extent, and how would it impact Sweden's forests? Here we assess climate and biodiversity implications - in terms of the area of old forest - of a completely wood-based future MFHC in Sweden. The wood required is assumed to be exclusively sourced as additional fellings in Swedish forests, thus carbon leakage from wood imports as well as displacement of other wood uses can be disregarded. Different types of timber frame systems and the role of varying future dwelling sizes are considered. We find that the wood needed for a complete substitution of concrete would result in very minor increases in harvests. We further register slight net additional climate change mitigation, irrespective of the wood construction system.

The results show that the fuel mixing process plays a crucial role in methanol/diesel DDFS engine combustion state switching. Premature methanol injection under methanol single-stage injection strategy causes ringing intensity (RI) to exceed the engine limit. Additionally, when start of diesel injection (SOID) occurs earlier than start of methanol injection (SOIM), the shorter methanol/diesel injection interval (MDI) leads to the deterioration of diesel premixed combustion for reason of methanol spray interference. Therefore, adopting an injection strategy with SOID earlier than SOIM under methanol single-stage strategy combined with an appropriately extended MDI achieves better comprehensive engine performance. Further optimization of methanol/diesel DDFS engine using a methanol two-stage injection strategy shows that the methanol two-stage injection strategy provides better fuel economy while maintaining acceptable RI. By increasing the methanol pre-injection ratio (MR1) and optimizing the methanol two-stage injection interval (MMI), the engine economy was further enhanced. Compared with the methanol single-stage injection strategy, the optimized methanol two-stage injection strategy reduced equivalent indicated specific fuel consumption (EISFC) by 3.95%. However, it should be noted that the combustion completeness under the methanol two-stage injection strategy decreased, leading to higher emissions of HC, CO and soot.

The goal is to overcome the limitations posed by repeated engine experiments and nonlinear test results. In order to optimise engine parameters, the research seeks to develop efficient machine learning models with high generalizability and employ an optimisation strategy to determine the optimal engine settings. Input for training and evaluating machine learning algorithms, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Ensemble LS Boosting was derived from experimental data from a combustion test engine, which includes Neat gasoline, and Ethanol dual fuel blend E20 at various load conditions. The dataset includes engine combustion, performance, and emission indices such as brake thermal efficiency (BTE), Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT), Hydrocarbons (HC), Carbon monoxide (CO), Carbon dioxide (CO2), and Nitrogen oxides (NOx), under various operating conditions. Load and brake-specific fuel consumption (BSFC) were training input attributes. Using a comprehensive experimental database of input-output engine parameters, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Ensemble LS Boosting were constructed. The training data points were resampled to generate multiple training datasets for training different models. 50 test samples were used to evaluate the generalisation capability of the machine learning models, while BTE, EGT, CO, CO2, HC and NOx, were the primary parameters subject to prediction. The optimal machine learning method was determined by comparing R-squared (R2) values, root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), and mean absolute error (MAE). Using multiple hyperparameter tuning iterations, the agreement between actual and predicted values for diverse Ensemble LS Boost algorithms was evaluated. The Ensemble LS Boost model exhibits the maximum level of agreement between predicted and experimental engine parameters across all datasets when compared to the other ANN models. This finding was corroborated by additional research based on test datasets, specifically the test sample interpolation data, which measures generalisation ability. The study also focuses on developing and applying two unique, interactive Simulink models for the Spark Ignition (SI) engine that are tailored for Neat Gasoline and Ethanol E20 test fuels under all loads. The key component of the model-based development technique in MATLAB and Simulink was the incorporation of sophisticated machine learning algorithms, i.e., Ensemble Least-Squares (LS) Boosting, to the model-based development workflow which produced reliable results. Implementing an Ensemble LS Boost machine learning framework is therefore highly recommended as an efficient method for predicting and optimising the combustion, performance, and emission characteristics of dual-fuel gasoline engines utilising Ethanol-based dual-fuel blends.

This paper examines the roadmap to zero emissions of the 362 cities that expressed interest in the Horizon Europe 100 Climate-Neutral and Smart Cities Mission.

Best practices are captured to create an informative set of actions aimed at policy-makers and at encouraging peer-to-peer learning. Finally, the barriers to incrementing circular approaches that emerge from the cities’ self-assessments are compared to those identified in existing scientific literature to provide input for a more comprehensive conceptual framework.

In this study we explore the effect ambitious policies for resource efficiency and greenhouse gas abatement would have on West Asian economies and what their contribution to environmental sustainability could look like. We employ the Global Trade and Environmental Resource Model (GTEM-Resource) to empirically assess the economic and environmental implications of global policy initiatives in the region. Results show that resource efficiency and greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement policies are complementary in their effects. Resource efficiency policies boost resource use productivity in the region, reduce all categories of material extraction based on sustainable consumption and production behaviour and also caused by trade, and foster economic performance. By contrast, GHG emission abatement policies have a small effect on resource productivity but drive significant GHG reductions that are accompanied by reduced economic performance. When these two policies are combined, real GDP in West Asia is projected to increase by 8% relative to business-as-usual by 2060, while resource extraction and GHG emissions levels in the region would decline dramatically by 40% and 50%, respectively. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates would be much better off, compared to other countries in the region, with large increases in real GDP and major reductions in GHG emissions and resource extraction levels. Findings suggest that technology development and climate mitigation policies would result in a win-win solution for all countries in West Asia, contributing to maintaining well-being and protecting the environment on regional and global scales. This shows that there is a pathway to economic prosperity for resource-rich countries and regions.";"2023-10-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623026161";"11";"Emissions"

In the primary steel making process, coal/coke is used for reduction purposes that lead to CO2 emissions. Replacing coke with other reducing agents like syngas (H2 and CO) could be a possible approach to reduce CO2 emissions. One effective route for the generation of syngas in a sustainable way is the chemical looping method. In this work, we have investigated the utilization of laterite ore (a mining waste) as an Oxygen carrier for the chemical looping reforming of methane. Multiple redox cycles in the presence of methane and air as reducing and oxidizing agents were performed in DSC-TG to determine the performance of the oxygen carrier. The reacted samples formed in the reaction were analyzed using XRD and SEM. The product gases generated during the reaction were also analyzed using gas chromatography. The results of the reactivity analysis showed that H2 and CO gases were continuously formed during the reforming reaction of methane. The phase analysis of reacted samples in XRD and SEM clearly showed the formation of stable chromite and reduced iron oxide phases. The oxygen carrier showed good stability, and a total hydrogen yield of 203.9 ml/g of OC after 20 cycles of redox reaction were observed. In addition, the theoretical yield of the reacted sample after the first cycle was calculated and compared with the experimental H2 yield at different cycles. A thermodynamic-based simulation study is also reported in this work. The syngas generated from the reforming reaction is used to pre-reduce the Iron bearing ore materials in a blast furnace. The results showed a significant decrease in the CO2 emissions and coke rate could be achieved in primary steelmaking by integrating a chemical looping process with a blast furnace. This study effectively shows the utilization of laterite ore as an oxygen carrier for generating syngas through a chemical looping reforming process to mitigate CO2 emissions.

Evidence from China ";" Developing countries usually face the twofold challenges of poverty eradication and carbon emissions reduction. How to reduce carbon emissions while achieving poverty eradication has become a headache for governments. In 2020, China announced its victory in poverty eradication. In the battle against poverty, Chinese listed companies have made meaningful contributions by actively investing in poverty reduction projects. However, the impact of their poverty reduction investments on carbon emissions in poor regions is not clear. This study empirically investigates this question using a difference-in-difference model and manually obtains data on poverty reduction investments in 592 counties in China from 2014 to 2017. Results find that Chinese listed companies' poverty reduction investments do help poor counties improve their carbon emissions efficiency, reflecting the possibility of synergy between poverty eradication and emissions reduction in developing countries. According to the mediation test, listed companies' poverty reduction investments improve the carbon emissions efficiency in China's poor counties through increasing green total factor productivity. In addition, results show that the improvement is more pronounced by strengthening government supervision, establishing economic development industries, and investing in counties with high ecological protection requirements and low per capita income.

As they address existing market failures and realize entrepreneurial opportunities to preserve nature, life, support, and community, they contribute to sustainable development. However, linking individual entrepreneurial contributions to transitions is difficult. Initially, new ventures lack the leverage to influence broad-scale transitions. For this reason, it is necessary to not only look at individual entrepreneurial contributions to sustainability transitions but rather to investigate them at a broader scale. This article turns to social representations theory to argue how the social representation of micro-level entrepreneurial actions in news media contributes to meso- or macro-level sustainability transitions. Taking this theory lens, we draw on a novel combination of topic modeling and thematic analysis in order to analyze 1167 newspaper articles from 2010 to 2020 on sustainable entrepreneurship with a tie to the Berlin entrepreneurial ecosystem. Our findings highlight the media's role in making entrepreneurial action for sustainability transitions relatable by referencing events like award ceremonies and trade fairs. We find that entrepreneurial contributions are linked to specific discourses ranging from globalization strategies to a TV series' on banking. Also, we identify particular entrepreneurial contributions in Berlin such as local empowerment and challenging agricultural and fashion industries, and suggest a comprehensive approach to investigate impact aggregated within ecosystems. Our social identity conceptualization of sustainable entrepreneurs as localists, researchers, advocates, challengers, and change-makers, can support their strategic communication, benchmarking and impact-oriented decision-making.

Therefore, this study analyzes the deep peaking characteristics of CCPP and proposes a low-carbon economic dispatch model for PV-CCPP. Case study shows that the typical daily peaking depth of CCPP is reduced by 72%, the carbon emission reduction is 4263t, and the annual system economy is improved by 43%.

To shed light on this issue, this study integrates institutional theory and the behavioral theory of the firm to explore the relationship between CET policy, green innovation, and operating difficulties. Using a sample of 136 Chinese power firms with 997 observations from 2011 to 2021, this study offers robust evidence that the CET policy positively influences green innovation. Notably, this influence is primarily achieved by mitigating factor-market distortion. Additionally, this study uncovers that the operating difficulties firms face suppress CET policy's influence on firms. This intriguing discovery highlights the boundary conditions that affect the policy effect. Furthermore, the moderate-mediation analysis shows that operating difficulties not only weaken the direct effect of CET policy on green innovation but also strengthen its indirect impact. Consequently, while the CET policy demonstrates a beneficial effect on green innovation, its total effect is still somewhat diminished by the presence of operating difficulties. This study offers a new explanation for the mixed findings in past literature and provides theoretical guidance for policymakers and managers to formulate sustainable development plans.

Hence, this empirical outlet explores whether economic policy uncertainty (EPU), renewable energy (RENE), natural resources (NRR), financial development (FD), technological advancement (TIN), and employment level (EMP) impact CE in BRICST countries for the period 1990–2020. In addition to this, the study investigates whether EPU mollifies the RENE-CE nexus. To that end, we make use of the second-generation panel data tests and panel quantile regression (PQR) models. The outcomes from PQR approach manifest that RENE and EPU wane CE across all quantiles, whereas FD and EMP upsurge it. The findings also elucidate that NRR and TIN have a heterogeneous impact on CE across the quantiles. In addition to this, EPU inhibits the RENE-CE relationship at all quantiles. Thus, we provide a matrix of policy suggestions to achieve SDG-13 (Climate Action) in BRICST countries. For instance, policymakers should encourage RENE and TIN to curb emissions. Similarly, policymakers have to keep in mind the detrimental environmental effect of low EPU. Thus, special measures need to be taken during the low EPU regime.

The feedstock for town gas production was converted from naphtha to a mixed feedstock of 40% naphtha and 60% natural gas (NG) in 2006, resulting in a 21% decrease in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and 1.58 billion HKD/year of cost savings. Increasing the proportion of the NG feedstock would potentially lead to more benefits. However, there may be difficulties in meeting the stringent combustion characteristics of town gas and the existing plant capacity may be reduced. Four processes for the production of town gas from NG are proposed in this work. The feasibility of each process was verified via simulation with Aspen Plus V14. A techno-economic evaluation showed that 296 million HKD/year of cost savings and 172224 t CO2-eq/year of GHG emission reduction could be achieved by using the proposed processes to produce town gas from NG. The reformer duties in the new processes were up to 16.6% lower compared to the existing process.

Few studies have been conducted that construct human well-being from a multidimensional perspective and explore the inequality of carbon emissions in interregional trade based on a human well-being equity perspective. This study applies a multiregional input‒output (MRIO) model to analyze the flow of carbon emissions and human well-being and capital between regions, explores the carbon inequality embodied in interregional trade based on the regional environmental inequality (REI) index, and finally proposes a shared responsibility scheme for carbon emissions and policy implications based on a human well-being equity perspective. The results demonstrate that the transfer of carbon emissions and human well-being through regional trade is realized through consumption. Different transfer paths of carbon emissions and human well-being lead to significant carbon inequality in interregional trade. Regions such as the West and North, which suffer more significant inequality in trade, receive carbon emissions mainly from carbon-intensive industries; regions such as the East coast and South coast, which benefit more from trade, transfer large amounts of carbon emissions by importing products from industrial sectors with a high carbon emission intensity and relatively low value and by acquiring more human well-being and capital. This study provides evidence regarding the current status of carbon inequality based on human well-being equity in China; fills the gap in existing research; and provides a reference for addressing the inequality of carbon emissions and human well-being and each type of capital between regions and formulating a fair and effective carbon reduction policy.

Environmental regulation in the form of resource agglomeration, represented by the high-standard farmland construction policy, plays a vital role in the emission reduction process. Using the panel data of 31 provinces in China from 2001 to 2019 and taking the high-standard farmland construction policy as a quasi-natural experiment, this paper constructs a continuous differences-in-differences (DID) model to explore the impact and mechanism of environmental regulation in the form of resource agglomeration (RAER) on agricultural carbon emission reduction.

Gas injection sintering technology has been widely used in industry for more than ten years, but the replacement ratio of solid fuels by hydrogen-rich gas has been stagnated at about 15%, the technical breakthrough is urgently needed. This paper discusses the influence of equal/segmented gas injection on sintering indexes based on pilot sintering tests, and the factors limiting gas concentration in this technology are revealed from heat distribution and mineral structure. The results show that the cooling rate of upper layer decreased with 0.8 vol% natural gas injection in 5∼12 min when the coke breeze reduced from 5.6 wt% to 5.3 wt%, which is crucial to improve the total indexes while the indexes of lower layer decreased due to the heat loss. Higher gas concentration will reduce the oxygen partial pressure, which will affect the combustion rate of coke breeze. As the gas gradient increased from 0 to 0.2 vol%, the number and size of pores decreased and the total indexes increased due to the decrease of cooling rate of upper layer from 112 °C/min to 74 °C/min and the hematite of layer-1 disappeared while calcium ferrite increased gradually. For a 360 m2 sintering machine, segmented gas injection can reduce the production cost of $1330000 and 50720 tons of carbon emissions per year compared to the equal concentration injection.

In the low-carbon scenario, Scheme 13 was considered the optimal path for Liaoning Province to reach the peak of carbon emissions from infrastructure construction. This scheme adopts measures to maintain stable economic development, improve energy utilization efficiency, and optimize transportation structures. However, this study has certain limitations. Potential uncertainties in data completeness and quality may affect the findings. Additionally, the applicability of the results could be restricted since this study solely focuses on carbon emissions from infrastructure construction in Liaoning Province, limiting its generalizability due to geographic constraints.

Discussion of an assessment tool: IPCC CAPRO change target";"This article questions the prospects for growth or degrowth of companies as a means of preserving the Earth's ecosystem. More specifically, we propose using a carbon productivity indicator in association with the IPCC Carbon Productivity Target (based on UNFCCC work) to assess the genuine ecological impact of corporate economic activity. This indicator was applied to data from 2015 to 2019 for a sample of companies in the SFB 120 index, and results from their classification are compared to the results obtained with indicators that do not take into account the IPCC targets based on UNFCCC work (Scopes). We highlight how a company's economic growth plays a key role in the fight against global warming. We found that a significant share of the companies that usually qualified as green using the Scope 1 and 2 emissions are, in fact, not green (63% and 43% of polluting and low-polluting companies, respectively). We underscore the fact that while green growth still seems possible, the same is true of green degrowth. More specifically, our results advocate for either controlled growth or for slight degrowth in business activity. Lastly, our results open a discussion on degrowth by highlighting how companies in this situation are over-represented among those that meet IPCC objectives.";"2023-09-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623025222";"8";"Emissions"

The UK represents a typical, affluent, import-reliant Global North country, with clothing consumption per capita at double the global average and the impacts largely offshored. Progress towards a sustainable, circular clothing economy in the UK has been sluggish, as it has been globally. Here, we develop scenarios exploring how, over the coming two decades, the UK clothing economy could achieve the ambitious reductions in environmental impacts necessary to bring humanity's impact back within planetary boundaries. The scenarios consider the impacts of production- and consumption-focused changes, and the modelling uses material flow analysis to develop an assessment of energy consumption, carbon emissions, water consumption, and land use. We find that cleaner production and recycling alone could provide significant benefits for land and water use, reducing footprints by 60–70% by 2040. But to meaningfully reduce energy use, transformational changes will be required throughout supply chains at consumer and post-consumer stages. The same is true if the UK clothing economy is to be on track for net-zero by 2050, which requires these changes to be well under way within the next decade in order to halve emissions. Given the scale of change required, it seems highly unlikely that current clothing business models are compatible with a sustainable future.";"2023-09-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623025106";"16";"Emissions"

The historical emissions growth and the factors affecting this growth can be instrumental in designing China's carbon neutrality target by 2060. However, a study focusing on China's historical emissions is rare, creating a substantial gap in the literature. As such, this study aims to analyze China's historical emissions path and how China's carbon neutrality is affected by economic growth, education, population growth, and political regimes. These variables have been chosen based on theory and empirical literature. We employ extensive time-series data from 1850 to 2021 and deploy the novel Dynamic Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) simulation model. Carbon neutrality has been measured using greenhouse gas emissions per capita. The study finding reveals an inverted U-shaped relationship between GDP and GHG emissions, proving that Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis is valid for China when participatory form of governance is considered. But the study fails to validate the EKC hypothesis when the liberal form of governance is employed. Population growth and education boost GHG emissions in the long run in the model with participatory form of governance. Contrarily, in the model with liberal form of governance, the population increases GHG emissions in the short and long run, while education increases GHG emissions only in the long run. Participatory form of governance decreases GHG emissions in the long run, but liberal one decreases GHG emissions only in the short run. Overall, the variations in the political system can have heterogenous effects on China's environmental integrity. As such, Beijing's policy should focus more on the development of a political sphere that is pro-environmental and that stresses on the implementation of environmental governance to tackle China's environmental dilemma. Our findings provide numerous policy suggestions to achieve China's carbon neutrality target by 2060.

Aiming at improving the effectiveness of ecological footprint calculation (EFC) for dryland areas, this study has modified the methodology of EFC for drylands by incorporating both ecological and productive contributions from desert areas into the EFC process, including the net primary production, emissions from energy consumption, and contaminant discharge, as well as water resources use. The modified method of EFC for drylands involved some recalibrated equivalence factors for desert areas in the calculating process to determine the yield factors for each local administrative unit at prefecture level based on its net primary production (NPP). The results from this study revealed the following: (1) From 2009 to 2020, the average ecological deficit in Xinjiang Region was 16.172 global hectares per capita (gha/cap), with average human use of the desert at 0.22 gha/cap, representing approximately 1.41% of the total ecological footprint. The average biocapacity of desert was 0.12 gha/cap, accounting for approximately 6.73% of the total biocapacity. (2) During the same period, the ecological footprint exhibited an initial increasing trend followed by a subsequent decrease. The ecological biocapacity demonstrated a significant decreasing trend (p < 0.05). All prefectural administrative units within Xinjiang Region exhibited an ecological deficit from 2009 to 2020, whereas a desert ecological surplus occurred only in the Kyzylsu, Kashgar, and Hotan prefectures. (3) As the ecological deficit in Xinjiang was on an increasing trend, it is recommended that in these regions, replacing thermal power with wind and/or photovoltaic power might be a way out to alleviate much of the deficit, since it could reduce the ecological footprint by 8.44%, and would decrease the ecological deficit by benefiting from deserts' carbon reduction. Based on this study, we would like to advocate for optimizing the energy structure in regions with significant desert coverage and enhancing desert production through implementing ecological farming practices.

This is a breakthrough in achieving the goal of “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals.” This study defines the connotation of the fishery eco-economic system and innovatively proposes to combine the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method with the SD model to construct a dynamic model of net carbon emission of the fishery eco-economic system in Liaoning. In this study, the main drivers of carbon emissions from fishery were investigated by using the LMDI method, the net carbon emissions from the marine fishery in Liaoning Province from 2005 to 2020 were estimated by using a system dynamics model from the perspective of fishery ecosystem, and a multi-scenario projection of net carbon emissions from fisheries from 2021 to 2040 was made. The results show that: (1) The energy structure and energy intensity have a negative inhibitory effect on carbon emissions, and the fishery economy and the fishery population have a favorable driving effect on carbon emissions. (2) During 2005–2020, carbon emissions from fishery reached a maximum of 2.5 × 105t in 2010 and began to decline after that. Carbon emissions from marine fishing account for 60% of the total carbon emissions. (3) Across the five forecast scenarios from 2021 to 2040, rapid economic growth significantly affects carbon emissions growth, reducing energy use in fisheries through technological advancements helps to reduce carbon emissions, and increasing shellfish and algal production simultaneously increases carbon sinks.

This study considered industrial sources of Jiangsu province in 2018 as the research object and divided key industrial sources into 16 processes. Based on the continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) data of key enterprises, millions of hourly scale monitoring data from 17842-point source enterprises at 169289 emission outlets were collected. An hourly scale high-resolution industrial source NOx emission inventory was constructed and compared with existing inventories. The total NOx emissions of power plants, industrial boilers, ferrous metal manufacturing, non-metallic mineral manufacturing, and chemical manufacturing industries in Jiangsu Province in 2018 were 55, 27, 64, 28, and 3 Gg, respectively. The total emissions from industrial sources were high in summer, reaching a peak of 17 Gg in July, and low in winter, reaching 11 Gg in February. The emission factors of the power plants, coking, and cement industries decreased by 15.95%, 29.03%, and 51.61%, respectively. Hourly scales showed that the power plants had the most considerable fluctuation in 24 h emissions at 5.94%, with high emissions occurring in the afternoon and at night. However, the 24 h emissions of ferrous metal manufacturing fluctuated slightly, at only 3.22%, and the high emissions mostly occurred at night. The WRF-Chem model was used for simulation validation.

European energy transition policies identify ‘smart consumption’ as a key element of these efforts, which have previously been explored from a predominantly technical perspective thus often failing to identify or address fundamental interlinkages with social systems and consequences. This paper aims to contribute to interdisciplinary energy research by analysing a forward looking ‘Horizon Scan’ research agenda for smart consumption, driven by the Social Sciences and Humanities (SSH). Reflecting on an extensive systematic Delphi Method exercise surveying over 70 SSH scholars from various institutional settings across Europe, we highlight what SSH scholars see as future directions for smart consumption research. Building from seven thematic areas (under which are grouped 100 SSH research questions), the study identifies three key ‘shifts’ this new smart research agenda represents, when compared to previous agendas: (1) From technological inevitability to political choice, highlighting the need for a wider political critique, with the potential to open up discussions of the instrumentalisation of smart research; (2) From narrow representation to diverse inclusion, moving beyond the shortcomings of current discourses for engaging marginalised communities; and (3) From individual consumers to interconnected citizens, reframing smart consumption to offer a broader model of social change and governance.

Finally, the spatial-temporal evolution of carbon emissions is analyzed through spatial autocorrelation theory. The results show that the carbon emissions from construction industry are highly increased by the construction employment rate (EM), and may be reduced by the energy intensity (EI) and carbon emission efficiency (CI).

We considered 14 green technologies across four categories: energy substitution, energy efficiency improvement, material consumption reduction, and process improvement. We developed a methodological framework to evaluate the decarbonization potential and costs of these technologies through quantitative models and to construct a decarbonization route based on the evaluation results. Using Huida Group Co. Ltd., a world-leading ceramic manufacturer, as a case study, we identified technological decarbonization routes for the ceramic industry.

Investors are called to consider the environmental effects of their investments and can influence the environmental practices of companies. The research proposes that the volume, stability, and value of socially responsible investors (SRIs) could be determinant in companies' adoption of environmental measures. From a sample comprising 406 observations of European companies listed on the Dow Jones Sustainability Europe Index during a period of economic stability from 2015 to 2019, the extent to which stable and significant SRI determines companies’ adoption of environmental practices, both reactive—leading to reduction of the environmental footprint and effect—and proactive—tending to achieve clean energy and the recovery of the environment is studied. The results show that the value and stability of SRI positively affects companies’ proactive environmental practices, while the volume of SRI is negatively related to reactive environmental practices. In addition, the volatility of SRI is positively related to reactive environmental practices. The impact of SRI on proactive and reactive environmental practices shows their decisive role in companies taking proactive measures. At a time when European companies are required to strengthen their environmental commitments, the promotion of institutional practices that stimulate the presence and stability of SRI can favour the development of proactive practices, as opposed to reactive ones that could be an indirect indicator of a company's environmental risk.

An optimization scheme for CCS pre-drying system (using waste heat from clinker kiln for drying CCS) in Scenario 2 was also proposed and had the potential to decrease the environmental impact. Finally, sensitivity analysis revealed that other factors (e.g., CCS transport distance, CCS content) may affect the GHG emissions and other environmental impacts of CCS cement clinker, which should be considered in practical applications. This case study demonstrates that non-carbonate alternative materials should be actively explored for their application in the cement industry, and a series of emission-reduction technologies should be developed for GHG generated from industrial process.

Previous research has only investigated the linkages at the industrial level and overlooked the spatial heterogeneity features, which hinders the precise decision making on mitigation strategies. This study quantifies the linkages between CO2, SO2, NOx, and PM mitigations across cities in China's steel industry. A database of 3689 steel production units is established to calculate the emissions. Then, the linkages of mitigation targets of each city are quantified by setting the tailored mitigation pathways in 2019–2035. The results show that the emissions are highly spatially heterogeneous, as the top five contributing cities account for 27.7–33.2% of the total emissions of China's steel industry, but their emission efficiencies are not necessarily worse than the average. The mitigation pathways cause two-sided relationships, as 138 cities will earn mitigation co-benefits to varying degrees, but other 11 cities show the trade-offs. In addition, the mitigation pathway will lead to the highest economic costs as 51.2 billion CNY/a, bringing heavy economic burdens to some cities. This study enriches the co-mitigation management theory and supports the formulation of spatially differentiated mitigation targets and measures.

In December 2020, the Government of Canada released A Healthy Environment and a Healthy Economy, a climate plan that proposed Canada's first national emission reduction target for the agricultural sector. This target aimed to reduce fertilizer-based emissions by 30 percent of 2020 levels by 2030. This target relies on the adoption of Best Management Practices for fertilizer use at the on-farm level. Choice to adopt the emission reduction strategies and practices is ultimately decided by the landowner, operator, and/or producer. The proposed target was met with significant resistance opposition from producers and producer groups across Canada's agricultural sector, particularly in western Canada, with claims that the target was the equivalent to a ban on fertilizer. This research aims to better understand the attitudes and perceptions towards the emission reduction target and more generally around emissions mitigation strategies within the crop sectors. This report takes a qualitative approach by conducting 26 h-long interviews with stakeholders along the production chain. Interviews with producers, geneticists, actors in crop inputs and manufacturing, and stakeholders in agricultural production policy and advocacy were conducted over July and August 2022. Participants were asked questions about climate change, the role of different levels of government in the development of emission regulations, potential strategies on a short- and long-term horizon basis, and incentives. Interviews were transcribed and categorically defined, highlighting reoccurring themes. These themes provide insight into awareness of different strategies considered by different actors within the agricultural supply chain, and potentially anticipate avenues which the Government of Alberta should prioritize in developing policies. Ensuring future protocols account for benchmarks of current agricultural operations and management is critical for accessible and producer-inclusive policy, that optimizes transition risks and secures the pathway forward, balancing the precarious equilibrium of burden on agricultural producers, food security, and sustainable, resilient agriculture.

Given the significant regional differences in China, the Chinese government has proposed “one policy for one province” guiding principle for carbon emission reduction. This study takes Tianjin as a representative of “a province-level city with high degree of industrialization and prominent emerging industries”, and Gansu Province a representative of “a province with a low degree of industrialization but the potential for green energy”. Using the integrated modeling frameworkthis study conducts a comparative analysis of the hidden flows generated by inter-provincial inward and outward transfers and extracts a feasible model for carbon neutrality transformation. The study also focuses on carbon emission, GDP changes, carbon hidden flow change in trade and carbon emission reduction path. By comparing the results, this study identifies the mechanism of the industrial spillover effect and carbon emission spillover effect between the two regions. Then it concludes the “cross-regional transfer mode of high-carbon industries” of industrial carbon neutral transformation: more carbon emission allowances are allocated to developing regions represented by Gansu Province, implement regionally differentiated carbon emission reduction constraint policies, and achieve industrial spatial transfer through more inter-provincial transfer. The paper found that in implementing a regionally differentiated carbon emission reduction constraint policy (DE scenario), the transfer of high-carbon industries can achieve the “superposition effect” through inter-provincial transfer. Accordingly, three carbon policy mechanisms for cross-regional transfer of high-carbon industries are summarized.

We applied multi-source data and methods to measure inequality of consumption-based household carbon footprints (HCFs) between income groups and across consumption categories. Results showed that, per capita household carbon footprints (PHCFs) increased continuously in 2011–2017, from 1.75 t CO2 to 2.47 t CO2. The increment was larger and larger owing to the rapidly growing household consumption expenditure. Average PHCF of high-income households was 5.33 times greater than that of low-income households in 2017. The high-income households should be more responsible for reducing HCFs and implementing the shift to the low-carbon lifestyle. Inequality was significant with a Gini coefficient of 0.458 for total PHCFs. The contribution rate of between-group inequality to overall inequality was increasing, from 42.49% in 2011 to 60.39% in 2017. There was the polarization characteristic in the inequality of HCFs between income groups. Gini coefficients of PHCFs for some categories were much greater than that of total PHCFs. It is necessary to focus on these categories such as rent, car purchase, furniture and durable goods to reduce HCF inequality. This study revealed the key income groups and consumption categories contributing most to HCF and its inequality, which could provide the references for carrying on the studies and actions of reducing them in the developing countries.

The proposed jet ejector scrubber was equipped with a cylindrical mixing section. The selected operating conditions enabled the development of a mixing shock process that afforded favourable conditions for sulfur oxide absorption. The first series of experimental investigations were carried out on a laboratory scale for a 40-kW diesel engine equipped with jet ejector scrubbers at a sulfur mass content of 0.35% in the fuel. The tests were conducted for various applied motive nozzles, as well as a nominal mixing section length-to-diameter ratio (L/D) of 25. These tests confirmed the complete reduction of SO2 using the jet reactor, as well as the reduction of other chemical compounds in the exhaust gas without using additional filters, e.g., reduction of heavy metals and transition metals by 85–98% and 71–74%, respectively, and the removal of total organic carbon (TOC) from exhaust gas at a level greater than 46%. The second series of experiments investigated a diesel engine with a maximum power of 250 kW under marine operating conditions. In this case, the effect of the mixing section length was tested. For fuels with 1.0% and 1.5% sulfur mass contents, full reduction of sulfur oxides was obtained for various loads of the engine.

We study a sample of 210 Nordic-incorporated listed firms from 2002 to 2020 across Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden. The baseline model with ordinary least squares regression shows that issuing sustainability reports and reporting under GRI Standards are positively associated with environmental performance whilst external assurance is insignificant. However, we find that environmentally non-certified and CSR awards non-receiving firms have all considered sustainability reporting practices positively related to environmental performance. Employing the substantive versus symbolic approach to legitimacy, we argue that firms with inadequate environmental commitment or reputation might be under immense pressure to achieve corporate legitimacy and may thus use sustainability reporting practices as a substantive approach to legitimacy. Our findings have important policy relevance in the context of the increasing focus on sustainability reporting standards in Europe and other countries.

In this study, ethyl levulinate (EL) was synthesized via levulinic acid (LA) esterification over a sulfonated lignin-based carbon catalyst and employed as an additive to improve biodiesel-diesel blends. The catalyst was prepared from lignin as a carbon precursor, modified via hydrothermal sulfonation at 180 °C for 6 h, and finally characterized. The effects of reaction parameters for LA esterification, such as ethanol-to-LA molar ratio (3–15), catalyst loading (3–20 wt%), and reaction time (2–6 h) were studied. Ethyl levulinate with 80 mol% and 100 mol% concentrations were examined as a fuel additive for palm oil biodiesel-diesel blends of B10, B15, and B20. The effect of the additive on the density and viscosity of biodiesel-diesel blends, as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions from engine combustion, was investigated.

Although many researchers have carried out studies on emission factors (EFs) in recent years, studies covering various types of ships are rare and the chemical characteristics of particulate matter (PM) emitted by them are unclear. Due to the diversity of different national fleets, the current emission inventory in China established by citing foreign EFs will lead to inaccurate calculation results and generate large uncertainty. In this study, the EFs for ocean-going, harbour, offshore and inland vessels were measured by the portable emission measurement system (PEMS). The specific compositions of PM were analyzed, including carbonaceous components, water-soluble ions (WSI), elements, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Combined with localized EFs, the ship emission inventory of Qingdao Port was established based on Automatic Identification System (AIS) data. The results show nitrogen oxide (NOx) is the primary pollutant discharged by all ships, followed by sulfur dioxide (SO2). The emissions of SO2 and PM from inland and offshore vessels fueled with high sulfur fuel (HSF) are significantly higher than other ships. Carbonaceous components accounted for 43.4%–53.9% of the total mass of PM, WSI accounted for 9.8%–14.3%, and elements accounted for 16.5%–28.6%. Although the use of low sulfur fuel (LSF) has reduced the emission of V and Ni from ships, it could still be treated as tracer elements of ship emissions.

To this end, this study investigates the role of globalization (economic, financial, and trade globalization), human capital, and technology with carbon footprint in the context of emerging seven (E−7) countries over the period 1970–2020. The empirical outcomes based on the cross-sectional autoregressive distributive lag (CS-ARDL) model reveal the direct effect of economic and trade globalization on environmental deterioration. Though analysis results reveal that financial globalization positively connects with carbon footprint, its coefficient is considerably low. Contrarily, human capital, technological advancement, and renewable energy improve environmental performance. The study's conclusion validates that human capital preserves atmospheric quality. Similarly, renewable energy and urbanization impart their share to alleviating environmental degradation. The outcomes of this research offer necessary policy suggestions to accomplish sustainable environmental objectives.

Compared to other conventional CO2 capture techniques, the Allam cycle stands out owing to its high fuel-to-electricity conversion efficiency (55–59%), the elimination of the Rankine cycle and reduced physical footprint. A key source of energy penalty of Allam cycle comes from the air separation unit (ASU), which supplies pure oxygen via an energy intensive cryogenic process. This paper presents a thermodynamic analysis of a novel supercritical CO2-based power generation scheme, in which a natural gas fuelled Allam cycle is integrated with a chemical looping air separation (CLAS) system, which supplies oxygen to the combustor. The modelling results show that the Allam-chemical looping air separation (Allam-CLAS) process can achieve 56.04% net electrical efficiency with a 100% CO2 capture rate, when a Co3O4-based oxygen carrier is used. This is 6% higher than the Allam cycle coupled to a cryogenic ASU. The exergetic efficiency of the Allam-CLAS system driven by the Co3O4-CoO redox cycle is 57.13%, also more favourable than a conventional Allam-ASU system (with reported exergetic efficiency of 53.4%). This newly proposed Allam-CLAS power cycle presents a highly efficient, and simple solution to generate zero-carbon electricity from natural gas.

To capture the multidimensionality of these transitions, the Renewable Energy Transition Index (RETI) and the Digital Economy Index (DEI) are developed using the Principal Component Factor (PCF) technique. The FixedEffect Panel Threshold Regression (FEPTR) substantiates that renewable energy transition has a significant threshold effect on economic growth and environmental sustainability depending on the level of income and carbon emissions. On the other hand, the Method of Moments Quantile Regression (MMQR) shows that both renewable energy transition and the digital economy have a significant positive impact on economic growth in all quantile groups. For the environmental sustainability, only renewable energy transition is found to have a positive impact in all quantile groups. From the synergistic effect perspectives, the CO2 emissions reduction is observed in both the low and middle quantile groups, but the economic growth promotion is only observed in a low quantile group.";"2023-09-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623023041";"59";"Emissions"

The relevance of green prospects in the work environment continues to expand. Still, little research has been conducted to understand the role of green intellectual capital plays in promoting environmental behaviours and outcomes. With China's higher level of carbon emission, it has become imperative for businesses to investigate ways to improve their environmental performance. For this purpose, we collected the data from 451 entrepreneurial small and medium-sized enterprises based in Jiangsu province of China and then analyzed it through partial least square-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Based on the social cognitive theory assumptions, this research study argues that; green intellectual capital, measured with green human resource, relation capital, and structural capital, positively influences green core competence. And, Green core competence positively impacts the green corporate image (environmental performance and green innovation practices). Additionally, Green core competence was found to mediate the relationship between green intellectual capital and green corporate image. Lastly, the study's outcome delineated that innovative green climate moderates the relationship between green core competence and green corporate image.

While the PM emissions from port fuel injection (PFI) and gasoline direct injection (GDI) vehicles have been well addressed in previous studies, few studies have reported the PM emission from the new mixed injection (MI) vehicles. Here, we employed a chassis dynamometer to investigate particle emissions under the Worldwide Harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycles (WLTC) from vehicles with three different fuel injection technologies. The PM and particle number (PN) emission factors (EFs) for MI vehicles are 129.53 μg/km and 1.0 × 1013 #/km, respectively. A trend of PFI > MI > GDI is observed for both PM and PN EFs for vehicles with same emission standard. Notably, the PM emissions of MI vehicles are greatly affected by both fuel injection methods at low and medium speeds, but are more significantly affected by PFI at high speeds. MI vehicle shows much lower PM and PN emissions than other vehicles at low-, medium-, and high-speed phases, but substantial hiher ultra-fine PM emission at extra-high speed phase. This is because the insufficient air supplied by naturally-aspirated engine of MI vehicles in the high-load region leads to incomplete combustion and generate large formation of ultra-fine particles. Besides, the gasoline particulate filter reduces 94.5% of PM emission but produces abundant nucleation-mode particles during regeneration at the extra-high speed phase for MI vehicles. Our study gives an insight to the state-of-the-art engine technology, i.e., MI vehicles, and reveals that this new technology is a feasible alternative for simultaneously reducing pollutant emissions from gasoline vehicles.

The main goal of the present research was to simulate eight scenarios designed to reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of passenger transport in a Colombian medium-sized city, taking into account the Global Warming Potential (GWP) of public and private vehicles, obtained by means of Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA). In this work we compared the environmental efficiency of the scenarios in order to make a contribution to the scientific discussion on sustainable mobility policies. Measures such as reducing the number of the most polluting vehicles, optimising the modal shares of public and private transportation systems, integrating electric vehicles, increasing the use of bicycles, and reducing mobility, have been tested. The results show that the current annual emissions from passenger transport in the selected city (263.98 kt CO2-eq) could be decreased by up to 64.28% by implementing a 50% reduction in individual Trips per Day (TpD) and distances travelled by private and public vehicles. In addition, increasing the public bus fleet by 50% could yield a 56.92% reduction in the carbon dioxide released, while using an average occupancy of 30 passengers in buses could decrease the total emissions by 25.73%. Augmenting the occupancy ratio of private vehicles was shown to yield a 22.71% reduction in carbon dioxide released. Also, increasing the electric vehicle fleets by 50% can produce carbon emission reductions of 17.96% for the current energy mix and 20.08% for a 100% renewable energy mix; while boosting the use of bicycles and increasing the diesel car fleet yielded reductions of 9.24% and 5.06%, respectively.

This work evaluates the technical, economic and environmental feasibility of obtaining SAFs by hydrogenation of vegetable oils thanks to in-situ hydrogen production via aqueous phase reforming (APR) of glycerol by-product. The novel implementation of APR would avoid the environmental burden of conventional fossil-derived hydrogen production, as well as intermittency and storage issues related to the use of RES-based (renewable energy sources) electrolysers. The conceptual design of a conventional and advanced (APR-aided) biorefinery was performed, considering a standard plant capacity equal to 180 ktonne/y of palm oil. For the advanced scenario, the feed underwent hydrolysis into glycerol and fatty acids; hence, the former was subjected to APR to provide hydrogen, which was further used in the hydrotreatment reactor where the fatty acids were deoxygenated. The techno-economic results showed that APR implementation led to a slight increase of the fixed capital investment by 6.6% compared to the conventional one, while direct manufacturing costs decreased by 22%. In order to get a 10% internal rate of return, the minimum fuel selling price was found equal to 1.84 $/kg, which is 17% lower than the one derived from conventional configurations (2.20 $/kg). The life-cycle GHG emission assessment showed that the carbon footprint of the advanced scenario was equal to ca. 12 g CO2/MJSAF, i.e., 54% lower than the conventional one (considering an energy-based allocation). The sensitivity analysis pointed out that the cost of the feedstock, SAF yield and the chosen plant size are keys parameters for the marketability of this biorefinery, while the energy price has a negligible impact; moreover, the source of hydrogen has significant consequences on the environmental footprint of the plant. Finally, possible uncertainties for both scenarios were undertaken via Monte Carlo simulations.";"2023-09-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623022990";"27";"Emissions"

However, the effect sizes of their association varied widely among previous studies, making it difficult to utilize global human identification to improve pro-environmental behavior. The variations in effect sizes indicate that some situational boundary conditions are likely to fluctuate the strength of the association between global human identification and pro-environmental behavior. In order to shed light on the situational factor that may boost the positive effect of global human identification on pro-environmental behaviors, the current research systematically examined the moderating role of perceived descriptive norms in the focal relationship, drawing on the theories regarding social identity and social norms. Specifically, we conducted an online questionnaire survey to measure all the core variables (Study 1) as well as an online survey experimental study to manipulate perceived descriptive norms (Study 2). The results of two studies consistently showed that participants with high global human identification demonstrated more general pro-environmental behavior only when they perceived that others were also behaving in an eco-friendly way.

Carbon finance is a product of low-carbon economic development and a derivative of green finance. It is an effective way to alleviate the global climate crisis and promote the transformation of the global economy to a low-carbon economy to achieve sustainable development. Studying the mechanism of carbon finance on the development of marine economy will help to grasp the influencing factors of the green transformation of the marine industry in an all-round way, better promote the sustainable development of China's marine economy, and realize the strategy of marine power at an early date.

However, the role of technological renovation in enhancing environmental efficiency has been ignored. This study provided initial evidence of the effects of cleaner production audits in China on manufacturing firms' environmental efficiency, which was measured by the emissions of sulfur dioxide and chemical oxygen demand per total output. Cleaner production audits were used as exogenous shocks. Their impact was estimated using the staggered difference-in-difference method combined with samples of ever-treated or never-treated firms using propensity score matching. The findings showed that firms that conducted cleaner production audits (vs. those that did not) experienced 4.7% and 11.9% reductions in the emission intensities of sulfur dioxide and chemical oxygen demand, respectively. Cleaner production audit implementation significantly improved firms' environmental efficiency. Additionally, a heterogeneous analysis showed that non-heavy polluters, small and medium-sized firms, and non-state-owned firms demonstrated the most improvement in environmental efficiency. Finally, the mechanism analysis results showed that firms' technological renovation in the production process is the main solution for improving environmental efficiency. This is a feasible and cost-effective way of reducing resource consumption and pollutant emissions. Accordingly, a cleaner production audit plan for different countries should be formulated with a focus on technological renovation in the production process. It should entail clean-cut incentives to stimulate firms to perform technological innovation, thereby continuously improving firms' environmental efficiency.

Studies of air pollution's impact on human health are vital in many fields, including epidemiology, environmental science, and the social sciences. To ensure the effective growth of socioeconomic sectors, it is critical to investigate the effect of socioeconomic factors on primary air pollutant particulate matter (PM2.5) and the driving mechanism. We conducted group-wise (i.,e. divide data in 5 different periods, D1 (2002–2006), D2 (2007–2011), D3 (2012–2016), D4 (2017–2021) and D5(2002–2021) spatial autocorrelation and spatial panel regression analyses of PM2.5 emissions using panel data from 34 provincial-level administrative units in China from 2002 to 2021 to understand the factors influencing air pollutant emissions. This study adds to the literature by considering comprehensive features and spatial effects in the panel-data econometric framework of the different areas. The spatial features analysis reveals that pollutant emissions in these regions decreased during the study period, although socioeconomic and natural factors are essential sources of PM2.5. PM2.5 emissions also showed significant positive spatial autocorrelations. Several statistical tests were run to examine the spatial autocorrelation among the regions. The results of a random effect regression model and geometric weighted regression (GWR) revealed that both socioeconomic and natural factors were statistically significant for PM2.5, though to varying degrees depending on region type. Positive and statistically significant results were obtained for China when considering the impacts of urban population, urban green space, economic growth, and economic spending.

As global cement demand continues to rise exponentially, the industry is taking numerous effective steps to meet net-zero emission targets by limiting global warming to 1.5 °C by the end of the century and improve the ecological system. Worldwide, about 2.9 billion tons of CO2 were emitted in 2021 from cement production and the industries are expected to achieve the net-zero target by 2050. The reduction of CO2 emission remains a major challenge for the cement industry as the manufacturing processes and the current infrastructure allow little margin for the reduction in CO2 emission, considering the age-old and conventional Portland cement chemistry. To achieve a net-zero emission target, several effective measures are being explored to mitigate CO2 emissions from cement industries, viz., use of alternative fuels, reducing clinker-to-cement ratio, improving energy efficiency, carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) techniques etc. Apart from these, production of low-carbon cement different from Portland clinker chemistry has the potential to make a big difference in mitigating CO2 emission. Carbonatable calcium silicate-based cement, is found to be a promising alternative to OPC and reduces about 70% of total CO2 emission from cement production. This paper thoroughly reviews the different low-carbon emission approaches (both direct and indirect) such as reducing clinker factor, lowering the clinkerization temperature by using fluxes and mineralizers (such as CaF2, BaO, SnO2, P2O5, Na2O, NiO, ZnO etc), producing low temperature clinker, use of supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) in concrete and capturing the emitted CO2 through mineral carbonation, direct air capture (DAC) etc for future alternative low-carbon cements.

Even though several scholars conclude that EI accelerates the clean energy transition of energy system, since the controversial relationship between digitalization and energy consumption in academia, current studies on the carbon emission reduction advantages of the EI are still in dispute. This paper employs the effect of EI's construction on the carbon emission peak goal of China's energy system based on the system dynamics model and different scenarios. The simulation results find that: (1) the construction of the EI could enable China's energy system to meet the carbon reduction commitment in 2028, with a carbon emission peak of 11.61 billion tons; (2) As digitalization and clean energy become more extensively employed, rising energy demand is satisfied by the manner of consuming low-carbon electricity energy.

In this study, we present a model framework for life-cycle assessment, optimized input-output analysis, and structural decomposition analysis. Specifically, for the first time, we assess the life-cycle CO2 emissions of plastics in China, the world's largest producer and consumer, and consider the input, production, consumption, and income stages of the plastic supply chain. China's plastic CO2 emissions increased by 38.07% from 2010 to 2021 and, under a business-as-usual path, will consume 4.2–5.4% of the global carbon budget by 2050. From a supply chain perspective, each economic sector assumes different responsibilities for emissions at different stages.

Furthermore, the results suggest that carbon trading reduces bond spreads by encouraging high-carbon enterprises to improve their environmental performance. Another channel is the information asymmetry between bondholders and enterprises. More active carbon markets provide investors with more information about enterprises' motivations for reducing carbon emissions, leading to a greater reduction in bond spreads.

When the conversion rate increases from 70% to 95%, the net electrical efficiencies of the CLC process are increased to 39.71/40.97/41.84%, and their life cycle results are decreased to 9.32/9.09/8.95 GJ/MWh and 300.85/296.20/292.07 kg CO2 eq/MWh. Therefore, improving conversion rate of the CLC and its coupling with advanced steam cycles for power generation are important for clean and efficient utilization of inferior petroleum coke.

Phasing out conventional marine gas oil engines is a key strategy to limit the pressure on the environment exerted by maritime transport. Considering the strategic relevance of this sector, the sustainability of innovative clean technologies proposed for ship power systems is crucial. In the present study, a multi-criteria sustainability assessment methodology, based on specific indicators addressing the technological, economic, environmental, and safety performance of ship power systems is developed. Normalization and aggregation perspectives are proposed to provide key performance indicators describing and ranking the overall sustainability performance of the alternative power systems considered. A sensitivity analysis is performed to identify the most impacting parameters in each domain. The methodology is tested considering a case study representative of large-scale maritime transportation. The robustness of the sustainability performance-based ranking is assessed by a Monte Carlo analysis. The results suggest that the ranking of alternative power systems obtained considering only techno-economic factors may be strongly affected by highly fluctuating parameters, such as fuel cost. Conversely, the inclusion of environmental and safety aspects increases the robustness of the results. A trade-off between the environmental and societal domains is also observed, indicating that the performance of cleaner solutions may be strongly improved if safety issues are properly addressed.";"2023-09-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623021479";"24";"Emissions"

An application of novel wavelet tools ";" In 2020, the United States produced 4.7 billion metric tons of CO2, making it the world's second-largest polluter. To achieve the SDGs, the United States has committed to reducing net CO2 emissions by 50–52% from 2005 levels by 2030. Therefore, this study examines the co-movement between CO2 and coal efficiency, climate policy uncertainty, green energy, and green innovation using data from 1990 to 2020. To support policymakers in developing sustainable energy policies at various times, we used wavelet cohesion, wavelet correlation, wavelet coherence, and the novel causality in continuous wavelet transform to investigate these connections. The wavelet coherence and wavelet cohesion results revealed that coal efficiency contributes to reducing CO2 emissions at different frequencies and times, while climate policy uncertainty reduces CO2 emissions in the long term. Moreover, green energy consumption and green innovation improve ecological quality by reducing CO2 in the short and medium term. Furthermore, wavelet causality analysis revealed that all indicators could predict CO2 emissions at different frequencies and time periods. Based on the overall findings of this research, we recommend that policymakers in the United States support green energy and energy efficiency initiatives as the most effective ways to reduce CO2 and address other critical climate issues.

To address the challenges of these problems, this paper proposes a multi-objective optimal scheduling model for IES considering the multi-timescale ladder-type carbon trading mechanism. Optimization models and algorithms were developed for day-ahead, intraday and real-time scheduling time scales, enhancing scheduling accuracy and usability. Day-ahead scheduling minimizes comprehensive cost and pollutant emissions while considering the ladder-type carbon trading mechanism; intraday scheduling dynamically adjusts carbon trading cost functions based on day-ahead results and equipment output; and real-time scheduling establishes new carbon trading ladder-type cost functions according to intraday results and emissions. A novel particle swarm optimization algorithm was introduced, integrating uncertainty models for wind, photovoltaic power, and load, along with electric vehicle charging strategies. The multi-time scale model in ladder-type carbon trading exhibits approximately 5% more economic advantage and 2% more environmental benefit.

In Saudi Arabia, steam power plants that relay on boilers to produce the steam accounted for around 50% of the total electricity generation capacity in 2021, in addition to 15% capacity from co-generation power plants. Fossil-based energy production produces harmful emissions, mostly NOx. The case of combustion efficiency and NOx emissions is complicated and cannot be addressed by simple theoretical model. This paper investigates the existing literature exploring data driven approaches via Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in a variety of applications, including mainly boiler optimization for efficient and clean energy production. The study discusses the importance of energy intelligence for industries in supporting decision making and prediction considering supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Expert systems, artificial neural networks (ANN), genetic algorithms (GA), fuzzy logic (FL), and different hybrid systems, which incorporate two or more techniques, are all included in AI systems. A condensed review of some recent literature is presented on the applications of support vector machines, ANN, GA, FL, and hybrid systems to combustion systems for emphasizing boilers' performance and emissions. An overview of boiler dynamics and control are presented and the use of AI for trade-off between boiler's efficiency and NOx emissions is discussed, with special focus being made on hydrogen combustion. The reported findings in this study demonstrate the promise of AI in control of emissions and optimization of performance in boilers with the least amount of construction and operating expenditures. The complexity and a number of restrictions present in emissions control systems, however, may reduce the likelihood of success. The specific perspectives are found to be data availability, data reliability, validity of methodology, and system complexity. It is concluded that wide variety of AI approaches have been used in a diversity of disciplines for modelling, predicting performance and controlling emissions of combustion processes. It is indicated that data representing the history and performance of real systems along with the proper selection of the AI model are crucial for setting up such systems. Based on this study, it can be stated that AI models are great tools towards better performance of boilers at minimum emissions.

Specifically, most developed countries have a carbon-neutral target set up for 2050, mandating all new buildings from then to be constructed as net-zero emission. Therefore, this paper investigated the economic feasibility of implementing NZEBs in the United States residential sector by combining a heat pump system with two renewable energy sources that are heavily supported by the federal government: solar and geothermal technologies. First, this study clearly demonstrates that “net-zero emission” is the most challenging task among neutralizing the energetic, economic, and environmental by-products from building operations. Moreover, this study analyzed the payback periods of multiple NZEB scenarios by considering the potential future changes in technology and policy necessarily required to meet the net-zero emission target by 2050. For reference, the technological and institutional factors were represented by “PV energy conversion rate” and “CO2 equivalent price of emission trading scheme (ETS)”, respectively. The results show that improving the PV energy conversion rate is much more effective in reducing the payback period of NZEBs compared to raising the CO2 equivalent price of ETS. However, the growing public awareness for this CO2 regulation policy will soon bring synergistic effect with the advancement of PV technology. In conclusion, this research framework clarifies the rather vague technological and institutional challenges that should be addressed to allow NZEBs to become economically feasible in the United States residential sector. Therefore, many building engineers, PV technicians, and policymakers should actively contribute to improving the techno-economic drivers for implementing NZEBs by 2050.

As a difficult-to-abate industry, carbon capture and utilization or storage (CCU/CCS) will be necessary to achieve emission targets. Among various options, CO2 mineralization shows promise to simultaneously capture CO2 and convert it to valuable products. When caustic (NaOH) is used as the absorbent, a portion of the resulting sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) can be fed back to the glass process to replace soda ash, a major component of glass and a large source of indirect emissions. Although a combination of glass manufacturing and CO2 mineralization presents a novel opportunity for drastic CO2 emissions reduction, such a process has yet to be studied. This work uses detailed, optimized process models to perform economic and CO2 emission analyses of three cases for such a highly integrated CCU system. In each case, CO2 is captured and directly converted to NaHCO3 and/or Na2CO3 by absorption into a NaOH solution. The NaOH is produced via the electrolysis of sodium chloride, which generates the valuable byproducts chlorine and hydrogen. The results are compared to glass production with amine-based CCS. The mineralization cases are shown to have net negative CO2 emissions, between −152 and −528 kg CO2/ton glass, relative to the unabated glass process and Solvay process for Na2CO3. The discounted payback periods for the mineralization cases range from 3.8 to 6.0 years, while the CCS case has reduced emissions of 353 kg CO2/ton glass and a negative net present value at the end of 20 years.";"2023-09-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623020048";"25";"Emissions"

This stage was most relevant in six of seven categories of impacts assessed. During the poultry housing stage, terrestrial acidification was dominated by emissions of NH3, P and N2O from one-day-old chicks (hatching eggs, poultry house litter, and feed). The total environmental impact of producing broilers in Brazil amounted to 3.37 kg CO2-eq per kg of meat at the consumer market gate. The LPG gas and biological waste from slaughterhouses was dominant in this phase.

To improve the prediction accuracy of carbon price, many scholars have attempted to use multiple factors to predict the carbon price. This method improves carbon price prediction, but also brings problems such as increased complexity and decreased interpretability of prediction models. When analyzing the influencing factors of carbon price, scholars tend to overlook the coupling relationship between feature selection and time delay, resulting in redundant or missing influencing factors. To solve the above problems, we innovatively propose a carbon price prediction model based on LsOALEO feature selection and time-delay least angle regression (LsOALEO-FSTDLARS). The model is mainly composed of two parts: (1) Based on LARS, the prediction model is constructed by integrating feature selection and time delay, and the feasibility of the model is proved theoretically. (2) On the basis of lioness optimization algorithm, the local escape operator is used to improve the global search ability of lioness optimization algorithm, and the algorithm is used for feature selection and time delay optimization. Finally, we conduct experiments on the data sets of the carbon markets in Guangdong, Shanghai, Hubei, Tianjin and China, and compares the proposed method with various other prediction methods. The results of empirical analysis show that compared with the best performing single and combined forecasting methods, LsOALEO-FSTDLARS has an average reduction of 31.05% and 1.30% in RMSE, 46.62% and 5.37% in MAPE, and an average increase of 31.39% and 0.94% in R2 respectively.

The Italian energy system is taken as case-study. Three scenarios have been analysed: BASELINE scenario represents the current energy system; MID-SCENARIO foresees a total IRES capacity of 158.17 GW (x5 compared to 2019 capacity) derived from the capability to convert intermittent electricity surplus in hydrogen and inject it in the natural gas grid; in the END-SCENARIO, the IRES capacity is pushed up to 272.1 GW. The main outcomes of the study attest that blending of hydrogen in the natural gas grid leads to beneficial impacts in terms of environmental footprint.

Hence, the multi-objective dynamic economic emission dispatch problem (MDEEDP) integrated with EVs and wind farms has become one of the hottest topics in this research area. In this paper, the MDEEDP in the presence of EVs, the random behavior of EV drivers, and WP uncertainty is solved using a new multi-objective evolutionary algorithm called the enhanced multi-objective exchange market algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, the novel point-to-point distance technique is introduced to find the Pareto front solutions set (PFSS) with a uniform and diverse distribution. Also, smart strategy management for charging and discharging EVs is proposed to smooth the load curve. The effectiveness of the proposed method and performance of the proposed smart strategy are investigated on two single-objective and multi-objective test systems, including EVs and wind farms, considering uncertainty and system constraints such as ramp rate limits. The simulation results show that the PFSS of the MDEEDP is well extracted by the proposed method while maintaining its uniformity and diversity. The presence of EVs and the application of the proposed smart strategy lead to a reduction of 2,926,497 ($) in the operation costs for test system 1, and, 38,694,698.28 ($) and 7,832,876.64 (kg), respectively in the operation costs and emissions for test system 2, assuming the same load curve throughout the year. In addition, the load factor in test systems 1, and 2 is improved by 11 and 19 percent, respectively.

This study's novelty lies in the measuring model designed to consider moderating effects of demographics and mediating effects of environmental willingness on pro-environmental behaviours and carbon emissions in Turkish households. The results show that household demographics have moderating effect. It has also been found that environmental willingness plays a mediating role between “environmental sensitivity and pro-environmental behaviours.” In addition, it is found that nothing affects direct carbon emissions. The main reason may be the use of standard equipment in the residences.

However, the consequences of such achievements are far beyond the benefits of the growth which severely affect environmental quality resulting in the rise of average global temperature, and various factors linked with changing climate. The current analysis takes into account a panel of Chinese provincial data from 2000 to 2020 to empirically examine the impact and the magnitude of GDP, renewable energy, imports of high technology, green financing strategies, and quality of institutions on the provincial emissions of carbon in China. The panel is tested for several diagnostic tests and a long-run cointegrating connection is confirmed among the factors under examination. The advanced technique of Method of Moment Quantiles Regression (MMQREG) confirms that GDP is detrimental, whereas, renewable energy, green finance, import of high technology, and institutional quality depict heterogenous impacts on carbon emissions. Furthermore, the robustness check of the Augmented Mean Group, Fully-Modified Ordinary Least Square (FMOLS) and Dynamic Ordinary Least Square (DOLS) validates and supports the earlier findings of MMQREG. Based on the outcomes it is revealed that except for the GDP, the explanatory factors effectively cut provincial carbon emissions in China, nevertheless, the magnitude of the green financing strategies raised a valid question which depicts a decreasing trend across the quantiles. According to the findings, it is proposed that the country should first prioritize green and sustainable finance and upgrade the domestic industrial technology with the help of import of high-technology that will relive burden on the environmental quality. Secondly, quality institutions will play an important role in coordination among various green financial institutes that will further maximize the gain from deployment of renewable energy sources.

The optimization phase utilizes the NSGA-II to determine the optimal allocation of multiple energy sources by considering various variables and constraints. A comprehensive assessment system combining the G1 method and the entropy weight method is proposed, and the TOPSIS method is used to evaluate the rationality and superiority of the energy structure. The relative trends in electricity consumption and renewable energy penetration are also analyzed in order to predict C O 2 emissions. The dynamic framework and comprehensive assessment are applicable to Guangdong Province. Results reveal that Guangdong province should prioritize the development of offshore wind power, ensure the stability of the power grid by steadily developing hydropower and nuclear power, and vigorously develop solar power at the end of the planning period. Guangdong Province can reach carbon peaking around 2028 and net zero carbon emissions by 2060, leading to carbon neutrality.

However, there is considerable uncertainty in the future production paths of hydrogen. Here, we conducted learning curve and discrete choice model to estimate the future production costs and production paths of hydrogen under different scenarios and discuss their carbon emission paths and uncertainties. The results show that from 2040, green hydrogen will gradually become more economically advantageous than gray and blue hydrogen, and the cost of green hydrogen will be 18–25 CNY/kg H2 by 2060. Among the various hydrogen production technologies, wind- and solar-based electrolysis will gradually predominate, producing 35%–70% of all hydrogen by 2060. The carbon emissions from hydrogen production, currently dominated by gray hydrogen, can be reduced by more than 70% over the next 40 years. The transformation of the hydrogen production structure is the key driver of reducing hydrogen-related carbon emissions; and the more ambitious the transformation, the easier it will be to achieve greater emission reductions in the earlier stages. In addition, the uncertainty associated with hydrogen production is closely related to the hydrogen development stage. The uncertainty in the market share of fossil fuel-based hydrogen is more than four times higher than that of green hydrogen in the earlier stages, but in the middle and late stages, there is more uncertainty in green hydrogen.

Techno-economic modelling and socio-technical transition studies are combined to explore the conditions, opportunities and barriers to decarbonising the maritime shipping industry. A set of scenarios have been developed considering demand assumptions and potential instruments such as carbon price, energy tax, and blending mandate. The study finds that there are opportunities for decarbonising the maritime shipping industry by using renewable marine fuels such as advanced biofuels (e.g., biomethanol), electrofuels (e.g., e-methanol) and hydrogen. Sweden has tremendous resource potential for bio-based and hydrogen-based renewable liquid fuel production. In the evaluated system boundary, biomethanol presents the cheapest technology option while e-ammonia is the most expensive one. Green electricity plays an important role in the decarbonisation of the maritime sector. The results of the supply chain optimisation identify the location sites and technology in Sweden as well as the trade flows to bring the fuels to where the bunker facilities are potentially located. Biomethanol and hydrogen-based marine fuels are cost-effective at a carbon price beyond 100 €/tCO2 and 200 €/tCO2 respectively. Linking back to the socio-technical transition pathways, the study finds that some shipping companies are in the process of transitioning towards using renewable marine fuels, thereby enabling niche innovations to break through the carbon lock-in and eventually alter the socio-technical regime, while other shipping companies are more resistant. Overall, there is increasing pressure from (inter)national energy and climate policy-making to decarbonise the maritime shipping industry.";"2023-08-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623020644";"40";"Emissions"

Optimising the energy mix of ships in different period is used to reduce CO2 emissions from shipping fuels and achieve the set emission reduction targets. Taking the Zhoushan sea area in China as an example, emission reduction targets are set in three period with a five-year period from the national policy level.

However, the current research has not systematically considered whether GI and PT coexist or whether there are differences in long-term and short-term dynamic decision making. It is crucial to investigate the dynamic effect of CTP on GI and PT. Taking China's CTP as the quasi-natural experiment, and based on Chinese provincial panel data from 2006 to 2019, this study evaluated decomposed the dynamic effects of CTP on GI and PT using a dynamic spatial difference-in-differences (DSDID) model. The results indicate that, (1) after the CTP promulgation, regional GI increased significantly, accompanied by a more obvious improvement in GI level in pilot areas than in non-pilot areas. The PT in the adjacent areas grew faster than PT in the pilot areas. (2) The CTP had significant long-term direct incentive and spatial spillover effects on GI, but also led to a short-term PT under the “pollution haven effect”. After a series of robustness tests, the dynamic effects were still significant. (3) The “competition for innovation (IC)” significantly enhanced the CTP incentive effect on GI under a siphoning effect, and the “competition for economic (EC)” intensified the PT effect caused by CTP because of collective irrational behavior.

An empirical analysis of data from China's A-share listed corporations between 2007 and 2017 is conducted, based on the Porter hypothesis. The main results show that CETS positively impacts enterprises' GIE, indicating that weak Porter hypothesis can be observed in China. This outcome is still valid after robustness tests. Further analyses demonstrate that: (1) China's CETS enhances enterprises' GIE by encouraging green product innovation; (2) the promoting effect of China's CETS on enterprises' GIE will be significantly enhanced with the improvement of carbon market liquidity; (3) China's CETS has a significant positive impact on the GIE of small enterprises, firms with weak political relevance, and corporations that are located in regions where policy pressure is high. This study provides an evaluation of the policy effectiveness of China's CETS at a micro-level and offers statistical support and specific policy recommendations to improve the CETS.

Considering the environment, economy, and independence, a novel multi-objective planning framework combining three methods has been employed to rationalize the capacity allocation and synergetic scheduling. A real energy-consuming park with multiple loads was taken as a case for hourly simulation, to evaluate the performance and operation of the proposed system. The results indicate that 38.84% of emissions can be avoided compared to the situation without carbon capture through the lifecycle. The natural gas cost and heat sale profit constitute the majority of annual expense and revenue, respectively. The interaction level with power grid is 6.87% at the optimal operation. Furthermore, two economic improvement measures were counted, and three disposals of the captured carbon dioxide were compared.

It is crucial to clarify what changes in the trade situation of China-BRCs bilateral trade before and after the BRI, including economic gains and environmental costs. This study applies the decomposition of production activities method to calculate the value-added (VA) and embodied CO2 emissions (ECE) transfer in China-BRCs bilateral trade from 2004 to 2017. The relevant results are fourfold. (1) The growth rates of China's VA exports and ECE exports to the BRCs are 1.44 times and 1.36 times higher than the growth rates of imports. (2) Electricity, iron and steel, and chemical rubber products are the main sectors of China's ECE exports. The oil industry is the main industry of BRCs' VA exports. (3) From 2004 to 2017, China's bilateral trade with most of the BRCs exchanged net ECE for net VA. Compared with traditional trade, China is gradually losing net benefits in VA for reducing the net costs of ECE under GVC activities. (4) The embodied CO2 intensity (ECI) of China-BRCs bilateral trade is decreasing, and the ECI of China's exports to BRCs is 2.11 times of imports. The primary driver of a decline in ECI is the CO2 emissions coefficient. These findings demonstrate that the BRI has had a positive impact on the China-BRCs bilateral trade and GVC activities leading to cleaner exports from China and BRCs. The research comprehensive analysis framework of economic and carbon emissions of cross-border trade established in this study provides a methodological basis for subsequent studies of other environmental indicators.

Therefore, this study investigated residential CO2 emissions inequality and its driving factors to provide empirical support for the allocation of regional emission reduction quotas. Using the residential data of provincial scale in China during 1997–2019, this research presents a complete decomposition from the perspective of energy use pattern and income disparities. The findings showed that the national residential CO2 emissions inequality decreased between 1997 and 2008, and then stabilized. The energy intensity effect was the main effect that decreased the inequality, while the energy use pattern increased it. For most inland regions, the within-group inequity was mainly due to energy input per income, while the inequality of coastal regions could be explained by the differences in income per capita. Regarding energy use inequality, the energy intensity effect was the main reason behind the inequality in heat and fuel energy use, but it had a smaller influence on the electricity consumption inequality. The Kaya-Theil decomposition model could be applied to investigate regional inequality in emissions, and the results help to design targeted differentiate mitigation measures for regional residential sector.

Leakage from industrial chloromethane production plants is a major anthropogenic source of chloromethanes; however, accurate estimations of the emission factors are limited. In this study, a plant-scale inversion system was established using field measurements, dispersion simulation, and inversion algorithms to quantify the emission factors of chloromethanes from chloromethane production plants. The results show that, with the exception of the emission factors (kg/kg respective chloromethane produced) of trichloromethane (0.02 ± 0.006), those of dichloromethane (0.04 ± 0.02) and tetrachloromethane (0.03 ± 0.02) were comparable to those provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (0.04 kg/kg fluorinated gas produced).

This study focuses on the preheating co-firing behavior of coal and biomass to explore the effect of preheating combustion and preheating co-firing on PM (particle matter) and NO source emissions, and different coals were selected to verify the effect of coal rank on this behavior. Coal and biomass were fed into a mixing device through two independent feeders and uniformly mixed before entering the furnace. PM and NO emissions after preheating combustion were measured using an Electrical Low-Pressure Impactor and flue gas analyzer. The results showed that preheating combustion reduced the production of PM1, PM1-10, and NO from coal by 22.30%, 10.75%, and 49.84% respectively, and also reduced the production from biomass by 28.61%, 15.16%, and 53.01% respectively compared to conventional combustion. Preheating co-firing experiments revealed that as the co-firing ratio increases, NO production decreased, but the production of PM1 initially decreased and then increased, reaching a minimum point at a co-firing ratio of 25%. Meanwhile, the lower the rank of the coal, the better the effect of preheating combustion and preheating co-firing, and the ash content and composition of coal also had an impact on the generation of PM1.

Air pollution monitoring stations in China capture exogenous air quality changes to overcome potential endogenous problems. Evidence shows that an increase in the operating days of air pollution monitoring stations will reduce the purchase of commercial health insurance in the city. The mechanism is that the operation of air pollution monitoring stations is conducive to improving local air quality and alleviating residents’ health prevention needs. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the impact of air pollution monitoring station operation on the cost of prevention is less effective in more developed cities. Finally, we demonstrate that the number of claims for commercial health insurance dropped with the operation of air pollution monitoring stations.

Many developed and developing countries have announced their plans to phase out coal from their electricity sectors. Managing the social and economic impacts of this energy transition is key to achieving political and social acceptability and pursuing environmental and social development hand in hand. As one of the leading countries committed to decarbonization in Latin America, Chile has launched a plan to phase out coal by 2050. To analyze the impacts of phasing out coal in Chile on jobs and value added, we combined an Input-Output analysis with ad-hoc labor surveys. We analyzed four contrasting electricity production scenarios that the Chilean government used to frame the policy debate: the current Long-Term Energy Plan (a baseline), and three scenarios that phase out coal-based generation by 2030 or 2050. Our findings show that coal phase-out will contribute to net job creation on the national level, adding 23–26 thousand jobs by 2030. In addition, value-added in the power generation sector will also grow by 1.7 billion dollars above today's levels as a result of the coal phase-out. These overall positive numbers mask a gross job destruction of 4.4 thousand jobs in coal power plants, concentrated in a few communities. In the most affected community, 7.1% of the population works in a coal power plant. Negative impacts in coal-reliant communities require special attention to ensure a just transition towards a clean power generation system. The results of this study highlight the need for strategic policy development that supports a smooth transition to a low-carbon economy, taking into account the associated national and local impacts. Our study also contributes to the literature about the evaluation framework of coal phase-out projects around the world, improving the understanding of their associated impacts beyond the case study country.

However, green certificate issuance based on power generation amounts restricts microgrids to participate in regional green electricity trading. In this context, a green electricity trading-driven low-carbon sharing approach for interconnected microgrids (IMG) is proposed. First, a new green electricity peer-to-peer (P2P) trading mechanism for regional IMG is proposed, where the energy sharing profile of each microgrid (MG) can be flexibly managed based on the interest. And the Nash equilibrium theory based on a non-cooperative game is applied to determine the trading capacity. Second, we define the green electricity value generated by P2P trading of renewable energy among IMG systems, where the green electricity value includes the value of traded green electricity, reduced carbon emission cost, and renewable energy subsidies. Especially, environmentally friendly factors are proposed to allocate the green electricity value between the buyer and seller, which can guide MGs to improve their energy composition and reduce carbon emissions. Third, a decentralized energy management approach is introduced to coordinate energy transactions among IMG systems based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). The simulation analysis shows that the green electricity trading mechanism can reduce energy costs, carbon emissions and promote the consumption of green electricity.

Accurate estimation of anthropogenic carbon emissions is significant for the government to monitor CO2 emissions timely and formulate emission reduction policies. To explore the application potential of interannual carbon emission distribution estimated by remotely-sensed data in monitoring carbon-related indicators of SDGs, this study constructed 0.2° grid-scale and municipal-scale anthropogenic CO2 emission models in mainland China and calculated carbon intensity and total CO2 emissions from 2015 to 2020. SDG indicator 9.4.1 and 13.2.2 were used as model indicators to evaluate the achievement of cities in each province. The experimental results show that all cities in Shanxi, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Guizhou Province, as well as Beijing, Chongqing, and Shanghai City, have reached the indicator 9.4.1. For the indicator 13.2.2, 15.6% of the cities have successfully controlled the growth of total carbon emissions, among which the Yangtze River Delta controlled well while that in the western region were slowly decreasing. Other cities still have a certain distance to reach the indicator 9.4.1 and 13.2.2. Using remote sensing data to quantify anthropogenic CO2 emissions at different scales can assist local governments in monitoring key energy-using units according to the emission distribution results and can also effectively solve the problems of lagging, absent and opacity of carbon emission statistics.

However, previous research on the environmental impact of organic agriculture has provided mixed or contradictory results. This study aims to analyze the role that organic farming can play in mitigating agricultural emissions across the United States. Using panel U.S. state-level data, we find evidence that farming activities increase GHG emissions. However, we also find that dedicating a larger share of farmland to organic and pasture farming reduces GHG emissions. A spatial analysis of agricultural emissions that accounts for the role of organic farming provides three key insights. First, the spatial distribution of agricultural GHG emissions in the United States is uneven. Second, agriculture is a significant contributor to GDP within high-emissions states where organic agriculture represents only a small proportion of total farmland. Third, agriculture has a substantially lower contribution to GDP within low-emissions states where organic agriculture represents a large proportion of total farmland. These findings suggest that reducing GHG emissions effectively may necessitate creating and implementing policies and initiatives tailored to specific regions rather than relying on general recommendations.

Moreover, the greenhouse gas emissions of the proposed pathways are compared to those of the conventional method i.e., steam cracking. The midpoint and endpoint lifecycle assessment of each pathway are conducted using TRACI 2.1 and ReCiPe Endpoint (H, A) lifecycle impact assessment methods in the OpenLCA software, respectively, for various geographical locations, electricity sources and assessment scenarios for the incorporation of the by-products.

In contrast, the fsQCA model allows for exploring sufficient conditions and identifying the optimal combination of variables that increase or decrease the ecological footprint. The results of the NCA model indicate that only energy consumption is a necessary condition for the ecological footprint. In contrast, the fsQCA model shows that low GDP is necessary for a low ecological footprint. Moreover, the fsQCA model reveals five combined solutions for increasing or decreasing the ecological footprint.

Compared with other thermodynamic models, machine learning (ML) models have the advantages of efficiency and accuracy in CAMD; hence, the number of studies on the application of ML models in the field of CAMD is growing each year. In this paper, a concise review of the application of ML to ILs/DESs-based CO2 capture technology is provided. The development process of ML models in (1) the prediction of the properties of ILs/DESs using their structure; and (2) the prediction of the carbon capture effect using process parameters is discussed. Perspectives on future research directions are proposed and key challenges are identified for screening suitable ILs/DESs using the capture effectiveness of a specific carbon capture process as an evaluation criterion.

However, previous research on the environmental impact of organic agriculture has provided mixed or contradictory results. This study aims to analyze the role that organic farming can play in mitigating agricultural emissions across the United States. Using panel U.S. state-level data, we find evidence that farming activities increase GHG emissions. However, we also find that dedicating a larger share of farmland to organic and pasture farming reduces GHG emissions. A spatial analysis of agricultural emissions that accounts for the role of organic farming provides three key insights. First, the spatial distribution of agricultural GHG emissions in the United States is uneven. Second, agriculture is a significant contributor to GDP within high-emissions states where organic agriculture represents only a small proportion of total farmland. Third, agriculture has a substantially lower contribution to GDP within low-emissions states where organic agriculture represents a large proportion of total farmland. These findings suggest that reducing GHG emissions effectively may necessitate creating and implementing policies and initiatives tailored to specific regions rather than relying on general recommendations. Thus, low-emissions states should be explored as examples of sustainable agricultural practices that could set the stage for scaling up organic farming practices across the country.

A systematic method for calculating catalyst production cost is engaged via CatCost utilization. The results are compared with commercial processes (hydrotreatment and alkali-catalyzed process) and other recently published research. The total capital investment in hydrotreating of WCO (hydrocracking of long chain fatty acids by hydrogen under high pressure and temperature) and alkali-catalyzed process (transesterification of fatty acids by NaOH to produce fatty acid methyl ester) are 39% and 97% more than that of the novel methane-assisted catalytic process, respectively. The consumed energy per unit mass of produced renewable diesel calculated from this innovative upgrading technique is 0.93 kW/kg of renewable diesel, which is remarkably lower than that for the aforementioned commercial processes. The production costs have also been investigated and it was found that using natural gas is noticeably cheaper than hydrogen employed for the hydrotreating process and NaOH and methanol used in alkali catalyzed process. The production costs for the methane-assisted catalytic process are 0.365 $/kg renewable diesel and for hydrotreating and alkali-catalyzed process, the production costs are 0.574 $/kg renewable diesel and 0.513 $/kg biodiesel, respectively. The economic results have also been compared with other research and it was found the total production cost of the new process is minimum, however total capital investment is a bit high. The results of the life cycle assessment (LCA) have also proved the advantages of the newly developed process because using NaOH and methanol in the alkali-catalyzed process and hydrogen in the hydrotreating process would have higher environmental impacts. The impact assessment showed that the proposed process contributes significantly to reducing global warming since CO2 eq results indicate that the proposed process emits remarkably less CO2 as one of the major greenhouse gases compared to other processes. For examining the risk of investment, the Monte Carlo simulation with 1000 iterations has also been conducted and the results manifest the high profitability of this process.

The experiment was conducted for two years (2017–2018 and 2018–2019) in warm season perennial pastures and cool season annual pastures grazed by beef steers. Three pesticide-free ICLS treatments – livestock-forestry (LF); crop-livestock (CL), and crop-livestock-forestry (CLF) – plus, a livestock control pesticide-free system (L) were conducted in randomized complete block design, with three replicates per treatment. Maize crop rotation was done with cool season cover crop under no-tillage. Eucalyptus trees (Eucalyptus benthamii) were planted in 2013 and intercropped with tree alleys. The animal performance, organic matter (OM) intake and enteric CH4 emission, yield, and intensity were assessed. We found no significant difference (P > 0.05) for average daily gain (ADG), stocking rate (SR), and daily live weight gain (LWG) per area for the different ICLS arrangements and seasons. The ICLS arrangements did not affect (P > 0.05) CH4 emission, yield, and intensity, with averages of 186 g steer−1 day−1, 26 g kg−1 OM intake and 210 g kg−1 of ADG, respectively.

We adopt a series of strategies to deal with endogeneity problems and find that our results are robust to these approaches. We then estimate the heterogeneous effects of the minimum wage standard and demonstrate that minimum wages' impacts on firm pollution discharges are strong for firms in the central region, those with younger age, those with small scale and those located in the less developed areas. Finally, we explore the potential mechanisms of raising minimum wages and reveal the existing channels that the more input of fossil fuel energy and less input of pollution treatment facilities in the production process are the crucial mechanisms through which a higher minimum wage expands firm pollution emissions.

However, to achieve the goal of net-zero emissions, the adoption of even stronger policies and increased carbon taxes is necessary, with transition risk becoming a major concern for companies. Even though governments worldwide have been employing a range of methods such as carbon tax, cap-and-trade, and intensity targets to mitigate the impact of climate change, a pivotal debate around determining the optimal policy that reduces emissions without harming the economy continues. Our paper delves into the environmental policy assessment emphasizing the role of endogenous capital utilization rates, which have hitherto been largely disregarded in literature. We study how endogenous capital utilization rate affects the transmission mechanism of economic shocks and the optimal environmental policy choice. To evaluate the quantitative impact of the transmission mechanism, we introduce distinct features to the environmental-dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (E-DSGE) model, including endogenous capital utilization, time-varying depreciation of capital, and environment quality shocks. We find that the complementarity between energy and capital leads to an amplification effect of the conventional transmission mechanism. Our model with these ingredients ranks any carbon tax below 25% as the best policy in terms of welfare improvement.

Since data envelopment analysis (DEA) provides a synthetic standardised index of environmental efficiency through considering real factors, such as undesirable outputs and integer-valued data, it has acquired major popularity in environmental energy efficiency. Previous studies regarding applications of oriented DEA models to environmental efficiency did not consider the simultaneous impact of undesirable outputs under the polluting technology and mixed integer-valued data on efficiency measures. The objective of this research is to obtain comprehensive environmental energy efficiency measurements by extending the output-oriented slacks-based measure (SBM) model of Tone (2001) and the output-oriented BCC model of Banker et al. (1984). Thus, new output-oriented SBM and BCC models in mixed integer-valued data and undesirable outputs under the polluting technology are modelled. The models have been utilised to examine scale energy efficiency, pure energy efficiency, output mix-efficiency measure, carbon efficiency, and potential carbon reduction of 30 provinces in China to evaluate their land transportation systems. Additionally, the results are remarkable and interesting compared to those reported in Chang, Zhang, Danao, and Zhang (2013) since many provinces, performed environmental efficiency. There are 12 and 14 provinces, performed environmental output mix-efficiency under CRS and VRS, respectively. Moreover, 50% of the total evaluated provinces performed carbon efficiency.

However, these studies disagree on how this relationship occurs. Some suggest that companies strategically decide to be more sustainable, expecting that stakeholders' recognition of their efforts will generate competitive advantage (inside-out perspective). However, others suggest that companies' sustainability awareness (and actions) increases only in response to stakeholder requests (outside-in perspective). Each perspective offers different views on how much stakeholders should trust the available information sources about companies' sustainability performance—what companies say (e.g., sustainability reports) and what ESG ratings companies present—because obtaining direct information about what companies do may be difficult for external stakeholders. In exploring how these theories support each other, we suggest strong structuration theory as a helpful tool for integrating inside-out and outside-in perspectives. We argue that these perspectives are complementaries instead of opposites, propose a framework to approach empirical settings, and apply the said framework to analyze the Cerrado Manifesto case, a zero-deforestation initiative led by private organizations, mainly European, on the Brazilian Cerrado biome.

The composite cements are claimed to be more environmentally friendly than ordinary Portland cement (OPC) in most Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies but overlooking the environmental burden from upstream material and strength degradation after replacing the cement may cause significant inequities between LCA models. This paper aims to present a comprehensive LCA, starting from sole OPC through binary and ternary, and followed by a high-volume replacement of OPC with alternative materials, known as quaternary composite cements. The latter incorporated coal gangue, limestone, and ground granulated blast furnace slag as cement replacements. The uncertainty caused by the variation of calcination temperature and kaolinite content of coal gangue were assessed by Monte-Carlo analysis. Results show that ternary composite cement is more recommended in comparison to binary composite cement, considering the very minimal emissions from limestone production, and a calcination temperature of 600 °C is the most recommended owing to the wider selection kaolinite content range of CG. The quaternary composite cement was determined to achieve the most satisfying performance from both mechanical and global warming potential perspectives.

Under the promotion of the new generation of technological revolution, whether enterprise digitalization can help improve enterprise environmental performance has become a new research hotspot. Taking Chinese A-share listed industrial enterprises as the research sample, this paper discusses the influence mechanism of digitalization on corporate environmental performance. The results show that:(1) digital investment has a significant U-shaped relationship with corporate environmental performance; (2) Technological innovation is an important intermediary channel through which digital investment promotes enterprise environmental performance: digital investment can positively promote technological innovation, and there is also a significant U-shaped relationship between technological innovation and corporate environmental performance; (3) The hometown identification degree of executives positively moderates the relationship between technological innovation and corporate environmental performance. Accordingly, we suggest that companies need to adopt hedging policies in the early stage to reduce the adverse environmental effects caused by digital technology and accelerate the digital transformation of enterprises and promote the development of technological innovation to achieve the goal of coordinated environmental protection. Finally, we hope that executives will actively participate in this activity and jointly promote the development of this cause.

In this study, we constructed a digital economy input-output model and proposed a carbon emissions measurement framework from an industrial chain perspective. Based on this, we empirically calculated and analyzed the carbon emissions of China's digital economy and its evolution from 2007 to 2017. Moreover, we explored the driving factors of the evolution through a multi-layer nested SDA method. The results reveal that the (1) embodied carbon emissions of the digital economy are more significant than its direct carbon emissions, mainly due to intermediate inputs from non-digital sectors; (2) carbon emissions of China's digital economy are driven by export and investment, primarily gathering in the energy-intensive sectors of the upstream industrial chain and digital-intensive sectors of the downstream industry chain; and (3) expanding demand has led to an increase in carbon emissions from the digital economy while energy use and production processes are the leading drivers for the decrease in embodied carbon. Moreover, the role of demand expansion and energy use has weakened while the role of production processes has increased.

These scenarios are then used in a stochastic computation to obtain a three-echelon supply chain design in Europe maximizing the economic performance. The emissions were monetarized through the incorporation of the European Union cap-and-trade emissions trading system into the model. The social impact of the supply chain network is measured in terms of the direct, indirect and induced jobs it creates, which are proportional to the economic performance. By combining the developed methodology with data mining algorithms, a reduction in the number of required scenarios by more than 90% was achieved.

Significantly, China faces the dual challenges of rapidly growing electricity demand coupling with its commitment to of emission mitigation. This study examines the low-carbon transition and sustainable development of China's power system through 2035 using a multi-stage mixed-integer linear programming generation planning model by matching future demand growth trajectories with the least-cost power supply path. The electric power installed capacity, power generation, carbon emission, power-generating cost, and abatement potentials are analyzed through various scenarios. It is found that China's electricity demand will reach 9800–13300 Terawatt-hours in 2035 due to rapid electrification. Every 1 TWh increase in electricity demand requires 0.41–0.53 GW of newly installed capacity. Reducing the proportion of coal-fired power generation and replacing it with renewable energy is inevitable. However, for every 1 GW of coal power retired, 3.7 GW of renewable energy needs to be built. Incorporating electricity demand-side management is crucial to developing an effective decarbonization pathway for China's power sector, along with inclusive policies and technologies to meet China's requirements for dependable, affordable, and sustainable electricity.

In this study, a new methodology based on LEAP and LCA was developed to assess the carbon footprint of a medium-sized university campus in eastern China. The emission sources consider six areas: electricity, fuel, transportation, water, waste, and consumption of other materials. The results showed that the campus emitted about 13,877 tonnes of CO2-eq in 2020. In particular, electricity consumption contributed about 77% of the total CO2-eq emissions on campus, while green cover and material recycling resulted in a negative emission of 404.4 tonnes of CO2-eq. In addition, seven common mitigation strategies were proposed to reduce the campus carbon footprint, and budgets would influence the implementation time. It was found that the seven proposed carbon reduction measures could reduce emissions by 97% in 2060, with decarbonisation of electricity being the largest contributor, leading to an emissions reduction of 64.7%.

Manufacturing and use of petrochemicals are such an important economic pillar of contemporary civilisation. Therefore, there is a strong incentive to allocate alternative production pathways in order to conserve scarce resources. In order to minimise global emissions, it is also necessary to utilise environment wastes to generate value-added goods. This study demonstrates the sustainability assessment of various biomass gasification utilisation strategies developed through the poly-generation process. The superstructure network, which consists of different biomass feedstock (sources) and prospective uses (sinks) among the various gasification alternatives (pools), is examined to find the most cost-effective and ecologically beneficial production routes. Superstructure optimisation aids decisions on biomass feedstock mixing and subsequent utilisation, while taking both economic and environmental concerns into account. The results indicated the importance of biomass feedstock blending in enhancing the profitability of the process and lowering the requirement of gasifying agents. The findings indicated the domination of the power generation technique at 95.9% for oxygen gasification and methanol production for both oxygen/steam and steam-only gasification options at 92.5% when economic objective is considered. However, when the environmental objective is considered, urea generation turned to dominate the utilisation allocation at 94.9% for oxygen gasification, and methanol dominated the allocation at 92.5% for oxygen/steam and steam-only gasification options. Nevertheless, when both objectives are considered concurrently, urea dominated the strategies in all scenarios with a varying allocation of 38%–95%. The former solution maximiser the net profit at 0.124 $/kg biomass, and minimised net emissions at 0.58 kg CO2/kg biomass.

Marine equipment manufacturing plants are highly energy-intensive and environmentally polluting segments of the shipbuilding industry, necessitating special consideration for environmental issues such as climate change. Through energy-efficient lighting, this study aims to contribute to the promotion of clean production and energy management cultures in marine equipment manufacturing plants. An energy audit was conducted on the lighting systems of a marine equipment manufacturing plant based on the holistic consideration of the following key energy-saving measures: energy-efficiency retrofitting, daylighting, and behaviour change. The daylighting application for the foundry sections of the plant offered an 80% reduction annually in the entire plant's energy use for lighting, associated costs, CO2 emissions, and external costs, along with an initial investment cost (IIC) of €35.480, a net present value (NPV) of €184.322,6, a benefit-to-cost (B/C) ratio of 3.7, and a discounted payback period (DPP) of 2.1 years.

Using CO2-treated ECC ties can yield lifecycle benefits primarily due to enhanced material properties – increased lifespan in this case – instead of due to the stored CO2 that would otherwise enter the atmosphere. Sequestration-based policies such as 45Q in the United States would therefore not incentivize deployment of ECC railway ties, despite their considerable CO2 avoidance opportunities. To reach these conclusions, cradle-to-grave lifecycle models were developed for ECC ties and conventional concrete ties and evaluated under 1000 possible use-phase scenarios. The models incorporated premature tie failures – consistent with real-world observations – that were used to study a wide range of non-linear impacts arising from the random nature of tie failures and replacements. The results show that past studies that neglected premature failure of ties may have underestimated lifecycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of concrete rail ties by nearly three times. Overall, servicing a track with ECC ties instead of concrete ties can reduce the lifecycle costs and GHG emissions by 12% and 21% respectively, based on median values of 1000 model run results. The expected benefits would be larger for entities like Amtrak that plan to expand concrete tie infrastructure despite significant challenges with premature concrete tie failures.

This study employs the staggered difference-in-differences (DID) method to investigate whether and to what extent HSR has reduced carbon emissions by collecting city-level data involving 283 Chinese cities during 2003–2019. The results reveal that HSR can decrease carbon emissions by an average of 2.3 percent. The validity of this conclusion is supported by a series of robustness tests and endogeneity analyses. Further, the heterogeneity analyses evidence that the carbon emission reduction effects are mainly concentrated in northern cities, central and western regions, and large-scale cities, while no reduction effect is observed in other types of cities, and even an increase in carbon emissions is observed. Finally, this study concludes that HSR has negative spatial spillover effects on carbon emissions, and these effects have a distance boundary that they are mainly concentrated in the surrounding cities. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of the environmental effect of HSR and can serve as a reference for reducing carbon emissions.

The impact of green merger and acquisition on environmental investment strategy of Chinese heavily polluting enterprises ";" No consensus has been reached on whether green merger and acquisition (GMA) contributes to corporate green transition. Source reduction strategies are conducive to corporate green transition, while end-of-pipe solutions are not. Therefore, this paper studies the impact of GMA on corporate different environmental investment strategies using the data of Chinese heavily polluting enterprises from 2011 to 2020. It is found that GMA promotes corporate environmental investment. And enterprises are more likely to adopt source reduction strategies after GMA, which is mediated by bank loans and positively moderated by retail investor attention and information transparency. The above positive effect is only reflected in enterprises under low media pressure or high-intensity government regulation. Moreover, GMA can further enhance green innovation through source reduction strategies. This paper provides new evidence on whether and how GMA promotes corporate green transition from a new perspective.

Based on the data of A-share listed companies in Shanghai and Shenzhen from 2012 to 2021, this study takes China's environmental fee-to-tax as a quasi-natural experiment, and adopts the difference-in-difference-in-differences model to evaluate the impact of environmental tax on enterprises' total factor productivity (ETFP). The results show that the environmental fee-to-tax significantly hinders the growth of ETFP. Further, this negative impact mainly stems from the fact that the reform prompts enterprises to choose strategic innovation and conduct greenwashing behavior. Furthermore, when considering enterprises' heterogeneity, we find that enterprises with large scale, high investment efficiency, state ownership, high market competitiveness and located in western regions are more resistant to policy shocks.

";" Carbon transfer in international trade has triggered disputes on environmental equity between developed and developing countries. Hence, it is urgent to make it clear the carbon transfer process of international trade between China and the United States, explore the adjustment plan of emission reduction responsibility and formulate targeted emission reduction measures. These will play an important leading and demonstration effect in addressing global warming and coordinating international carbon reduction. This study built a CO2 international trade transfer network model of China and the United States. Based on identifying the carbon transfer path flowing from primary product sector to final production sector, and then to final consumption, we analyzed the industrial association relationship and distribution differences between China and the United States with external countries and regions. Lastly, we put forward emission reduction policy implication in industrial scale. The key paths of China and the United States are concentrated in the two export and import transfer types respectively. Among the key paths of China's bilateral primary production export type, paths from domestic Electricity, Gas and Water to foreign Construction accounted for the largest 40% share. As for the United States, transfer type of bilateral final production import is the most prominent, and path number and flow from foreign Transport to domestic Public Administration both accounted for more than 30%. Based on shared responsibility to adjust the emission reduction tasks under the Paris Agreement, China and the US will allow to emit 10% more and reduce 6% more, reaching 54% and 25% respectively. Taking into full consideration the national economic development level and the differences in the production technology level of industrial sectors, as well as the upstream and downstream related sectors' relationship, the refined emission reduction strategy is proposed from different aspects, such as technical assistance, financial support, import control, technology sharing and consumption transformation.

However, the co-benefits of CO2 and air pollutant emission reductions generated by the change in energy structure for different building types in China are still unknown. Using the cases of 30 provincial regions in China, based on detailed local electricity, heat, and household energy consumption data and emission factors, we established provincial CO2 and air pollutant emissions from building operations during 2016–2020. The impact of changes in the energy structure on the co-benefits of air pollutants emission reduction was investigated. Results showed that in 2020, building operation energy consumption in China was 610 Mtce. CO2 emissions were 2.53 Gt, and emissions of PM2.5, SO2, and NOX were 0.18, 0.38, and 0.48 Mt, respectively.

Apart from material distribution during product assembly, rational optimization of cutting parameters and production scheduling during processing are the main ways to realize low-carbon manufacturing. The existing researches mainly focus on cutting parameters or production scheduling when reducing manufacturing carbon emissions, but seldom considers the coupling relationship between the two. This limits the reduction of emissions to some extent. On this basis, a collaborative low-carbon optimization system suitable for the actual use of enterprises was developed. The optimization of production scheduling is a discrete problem, while cutting parameters are continuous and processing time brought by different cutting parameters will cause different effects on the scheduling scheme. Therefore, a two-stage optimization strategy is adopted to achieve collaborative optimization of cutting parameters and production scheduling. To achieve multi-objective optimization of the model and speed up convergence, the Crowding Niche mechanism and elite retention strategy are introduced into the selection operator to improve the genetic algorithm based on Pareto Optimality. In addition, different from the traditional that need to manually determine the machine tool and cutting tool according to the demand, a knowledge base module is integrated into the system. The knowledge base module is qualified for the knowledge acquisition and instance matching of the model in order to meet the processing capacity and constraints and enhance the ability of intelligent decision-making during production. Finally, the interactive application interface of the collaborative low-carbon optimization system has been implemented and the effectiveness of the system is verified by taking the manufacturing case of electromechanical enterprises as an example.

Discovering these interrelations between criteria to anticipate conflicts and integrate them appropriately into multi-criteria analysis is important for ranking urban transportation services. This paper presents a novel, two-folded methodology for assessing the sustainability of different urban transportation services. First, integrative structural modeling with polarity (ISM-P) is used for universally identifying sustainability criteria interrelationships and weighting them. Second, the Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluation (PROMETHEE) method is applied to a sustainability assessment of five specific urban transportation services (public and sharing).

It encourages target companies to take green innovation but brings fulfillment pressure. Policy prospects for a low-carbon economy are widely discussed in current studies while insufficient attention has been paid to the effect of the policy on the operating activities of target companies. Using the data of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2007 to 2020, this paper explores the effect of carbon emission policy on the financial performance of target companies. The main empirical results prove the significant positive effect of the policy on the financial performance of target companies and reject the interference of earnings management and survivor bias. Further analysis indicates that target companies significantly reduce the selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses and non-operating expenses. The trade of carbon quotas between target companies is allowed and it is regarded as non-operating activity. Results of non-operating revenues and expenses prove that target companies tend to actively reduce carbon emissions but the action does not exceed the policy expectation. The increasing efficiency of asset utilization represents that target companies have taken relevant measures to deal with overcapacity. This paper confirms the positive policy responses of target companies. Policy implications are proposed from the perspective of coverage expansion and market incentive mechanisms to realize the full potential of target companies for carbon emission reduction.

High Efficiency Eco-economic Zone of Yellow River Delta (HEEZ-YRD) are typical of land use patterns affecting carbon emissions due to the fact they have greater dramatic land use changes. Here, we used carbon emission model and the decoupling analysis to assess the impact of land use patterns on carbon emissions based on the 30-m Global Land Cover Dataset (GlobeLand30) and socio-economic data from 2000 to 2019. The results showed that construction land increased while cropland decreased. The construction land area increased from cropland was 9.03 × 104ha from 2000 to 2010 and 1.44 × 105ha from 2010 to 2019, indicating that the increase in construction land mainly from cropland.

";" Many studies have demonstrated the importance of clean energy development for China to meet its carbon peaking commitments and to contribute to solving world environmental problems. However, few studies have integrated spatial correlation and carbon peaking process to fully reveal the spatial spillover effects of carbon emissions and the urgency of emission reduction. The unexpected power cuts in 2020 poses a new requirement to deeply grasp China's clean energy development and carbon peaking attainment. To this end, the spatial econometric panel model and GM (1, N) are used to explore the development of clean energy, the spatial characteristics of carbon emissions, the process of carbon peaking, and the association between them. And all these are based on the real-life dilemma of power cuts and the underlying development-emission conflict in China. The results show that: (1) clean energy development in a region will increase local carbon emissions, but will significantly suppress carbon emissions in neighboring regions; (2) there is an inverted ""U"" curve relationship between clean energy development and carbon emissions, and China is still in the early stage of positive correlation; (3) fossil energy saved in a region tends to flow to neighboring regions with similar scale of economic development; (4) under the current development model, only 17% of the regions with clean energy development will be able to reduce emissions and successfully reach the peak by 2030, which implies a major emissions reduction challenge for China. The situation of carbon emission reduction in China is far from optimistic. Corresponding policy recommendations are given at the end.

Here, we quantitatively analyze for the first time the environmental and energy benefits of PHEVs after GLOSA application by combining acquired real-road driving cycles (DCs) and chassis dynamometer tests. We found that GLOSA significantly reduced the frequency of PHEV engine starts and throttle openings by reducing the number of stops and starts, the intensity of acceleration and the ratio of acceleration to idle time, and shifted more engine and motor operating points into the efficiency zone. The improved powertrain operating conditions significantly reduced the energy consumption and pollutant emissions of PHEV.

The United Nations (UN) has urged businesses to follow eco-friendly practices to protect and revive nature. In this regard, it is imperative to investigate which factors facilitate firms in achieving the UN sustainable development goals. Using the lens of the stakeholder theory, this study delves into investigating the role of environmental and organizational factors in firms’ green innovation and sustainable development activities. Considering the imperative role of organizational capabilities to absorb and capitalize on the knowledge, the authors took knowledge absorptive capacity (KAC) as the moderating variable in the main model. The authors received data from manufacturing firms in Turkey and analyzed it through the PLS-SEM technique. It is found that organizational and environmental factors significantly help firms achieve green innovation and sustainable development goals. Moreover, the organizational capacity to absorb knowledge bolsters the relationship between the main hypotheses. However, an insignificant moderating role of KAC was identified between environmental factors and sustainable development. Considering environmental and organizational factors as driving forces of firm performance, this study links them with green innovation and sustainable development activities by integrating KAC as an acute boundary condition. The findings provide practical implications to industrialists and stakeholders for complying with the United Nations' sustainable development goals by capitalizing on studied variables.

Therefore, low-carbon supply chain management has become crucial. This paper studies a dual-market low-carbon supply chain operation in urban and rural markets with one manufacturer and two retailers. Three scenarios are considered: no government intervention, government intervention and joint promotion under government intervention. By establishing and solving three differential game models, we give the dynamic technological innovation, advertising and store promotion strategies of the manufacturer and two retailers and show the impact of government intervention and joint promotion on emissions reduction and performance. The results show that: first, government intervention can increase technology innovation efforts and decrease advertising efforts, while joint store promotion under government intervention has a positive effect on manufacturer's advertising and technological innovation efforts; second, government intervention may increase the profits of the manufacturer, although it will undoubtedly reduce the profits of the retailers, while joint store promotion under government intervention can further improve the profits of the manufacturer and retailers; third, compared to the preferences of rural consumers, manufacturer's technological innovation strategy relies more on the price and promotion preferences of urban consumers. Moreover, the preference differences between the two types of consumers have a weak impact on the manufacturer's advertising strategy, while the price preference of rural consumers has a more significant impact on the advertising efforts of the manufacturer. Overall, the research results can provide valuable suggestions for the members of the low-carbon supply chain in the dual market to improve the economic and environmental performance of the low-carbon supply chain.

To improve the accuracy of the quantification of carbon emissions (CEs) over the life cycle of pavements, a system for quantifying uncertainty was developed and a case study was conducted in conjunction with sensitivity analysis. The data quality index (DQI) combined with the beta distribution method was implemented to assess parameter uncertainty. The uncertainty of the model parameters was characterized using the results of slice sampling. The uncertainty in the shape of the model was described by the difference before and after the correction of the Hermite orthogonal polynomials. Various uncertainties are conveyed by the Monte Carlo simulation sampling method. To provide reliable emissions data, VISSIM and MOVES were used to calculate additional CEs from congestion. This study assesses the uncertainty of a specific road LCA case. The results show that uncertainty in model form has the greatest impact on results. The use and maintenance phases are key stages for improving the reliability of pavement life cycle CEs, with CEs and uncertainty contributions of around 90% and 94% respectively. The time-triggered conservation strategy has a 75% probability of dominance. This study provides a comprehensive theoretical basis for improving the quality of road LCA CE results, and also makes recommendations for the development of green and low-carbon road engineering.

Pareto optimal design solutions are determined for a realistic point-to-point CO2 pipeline using Level Diagrams and choosing the Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) as a decision variable. A quantitative procedure entailing the definition of economic and environmental key performance indicators is defined to allow the identification of an optimum pipeline design. The outcome is compared against the minimisation of single-objective indicators based on the CO2 avoided and carbon pricing concepts. The results of a case-study concerning a 70 km long pipeline transporting 10 Mt yr−1 of supercritical CO2 show that the multi-objective method yields an optimum NPS equal to 30, higher than the NPS 28 deriving from the alternative indexing methods. The proposed multicriteria approach effectively considers case-specific environmental sustainability constraints, which result in determining 46% of the overall performance measure of the identified optimum solution. The results show that conventional single-objective methods underestimate the contribution of environmental factors up to 2.6% of the overall performance index value. A Monte Carlo probabilistic analysis is performed to verify the robustness of the results with respect to the possible uncertainties.";"2023-07-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623014889";"18";"Emissions"

Spatial dual mediating effects of carbon emissions and foreign investment ";" Climate change has steadily gained attention as the global economy has grown more quickly, preventing continued high-quality economic growth. In this context, the eco-innovation concept has recently risen to the top of the list of academic research topics since it is a crucial tool that combines reduced environmental effects with a favourable socioeconomic impact. Nevertheless, the environmental situation is not improving despite the increasing eco-innovation level. From one perspective, instead of concentrating on how eco-innovation lessens carbon emissions, this research explores the indirect effect of carbon emissions on the GDP-eco-innovation nexus. From another perspective, since FDI might lessen harmful pollution, this research analyses the indirect effect of FDI on the economic growth-eco-innovation nexus. Therefore, this paper highlights the relationship between eco-innovation and economic growth (GDP), considering the dual mediating roles of carbon emissions and FDI. First, we examine the effects of GDP on eco-innovation activities in nine MENA countries from 2000 to 2019 using the geographic Durbin model based on spatial panel data. Second, this paper analysed the dual mediating effect of carbon emissions and FDI using the spatial stepwise regression model. The findings of this paper are as follows: (i) GDP positively impacts eco-innovation activities, and (ii) carbon emissions and FDI mediate the GDP-eco-innovation nexus. Therefore, GDP, FDI, and carbon emissions are significant drivers of eco-innovation. This research represents an essential step towards a better understanding of the need to support the transition to sustainability.

Empirical evidence from China's high-carbon industries ";" Global warming can be solved with carbon trading. When carbon emissions become a commodity, it can be a powerful motivator for companies to optimize production capacity and innovate technologically. The goal of this paper is to examine the way in which China's carbon emissions trading policy (CET) influences firm technological innovation in seven pilot regions, using a sample of firms in eight high-carbon industries. We employ difference-in-difference (DID) as well as DID-based propensity score matching (PSM-DID) models to investigate the influence of China's carbon emission policy on firms' technological innovation by using 4745 observations of 749 A-share listed firms in eight high-carbon industries in mainland China from 2007 to 2021. According to the findings, China's CET policy significantly boosts firms' technological innovation, and this beneficial effect persists even after a series of robustness tests that change the policy's implementation year and the technological innovation measure. Further analysis shows that this positive effect is heterogeneous across high-carbon industries and firms with different ownership. In addition, based on the external governance perspective, we find that CET policy performs better in firms in high-carbon industries with a sizable portion of ownership held by institutional investors. This study suggests the effectiveness of CET policy in promoting firms' technological innovation, confirms empirical evidence for Porter's hypothesis, and provides a basis for Chinese firms to achieve their emission reduction targets by improving technological innovation.

However, the policy network that supports NEV development has been underexplored. This paper explores NEV as an innovative niche for sustainable transition and investigates the evolutionary mechanism of its policy network by combining insights from policy network, strategic niche management and technology innovation system (TIS) theories. Operationally, this paper adopted a social network analysis method to study the NEV policy network in various niche development stages consisting of 377 NEV policy documents formulated by government agencies between 2000 and 2021. Results show the NEV policy network evolves towards bigger, newer actors and is more heterogeneous in creating joint efforts in policymaking that promotes niche development and facilitates a transition to a market niche. Specifically, the policy network expands continually, and network density reaches the maximum of 0.635 at the end of the technological niche. Six agencies are identified as dominators in NEV policymaking. Collaboration on NEV policymaking exhibits obvious organisational heterogeneity, especially in the market niche with an E-I value of 0.576. This study enhances understanding of the evolutionary patterns of policy network and its function on supporting TIS development for immaturely sustainable technologies.

From the perspective of an integrated evaluation framework comprising a multi-regional input-output model, system balance theory, and complex network theory, this research paper uncovers the spatial- and temporal changes of trade-induced air pollution inequality among countries along the BRI route for the time period from 2011 to 2016. The study findings point out that there exists an obvious spatial heterogeneity in the unequal relations among BRI economies. This implies that a large number of country pairs demonstrate weak inequalities, whereas a relatively small number of country pairs represent strong inequalities. In addition, the countries' positions indicate a unique characteristic of “duality and inverse”, which is majorly manifested as pure causers represented by Moldova and Belarus, net beneficiaries symbolized by China and Russia, and pure victims exemplified by Bhutan. Meanwhile, nearly half of the dual identities are represented by Singapore. Besides this, the proposal and implementation of the BRI exert a positive influence on both system stability and inequality mitigation by supporting the balance of triangles. Finally, this paper posits that the environmental inequality system of the Belt and Road is not as complex as imagined since the 3-node motif classification is relatively simple. Our findings are helpful for mitigating air pollution inequalities so as to support the sustainable development of green BRI.

On the basis of symbolic self-completion theory and social cognitive theory, we examine the mediation role of self-enhancement motivation and the moderation role of extravagant atmosphere. Survey results from 565 citizens in China demonstrate that materialism is positively related to energy efficiency purchase and negatively related to energy curtailment behavior through self-enhancement motivation. Furthermore, extravagant atmosphere reinforces the positive connection between materialism and self-enhancement motivation and further moderates the indirect effect of materialism on energy efficiency purchase and energy curtailment behavior.

";" Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pose a serious threat to human habitats because they are the cause of the increasing number of ecological problems and adverse weather events blighting our planet. Considering the rising trend in environmental concerns and the critical role of the board of directors in strategic corporate decisions, this paper examines the impact of co-opted boards on GHG emissions and the moderating effect of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance-based compensation on the relationship. Using a sample of US firms from 2002 to 2018, the results show a significant negative relationship between co-opted directors and total GHG emissions, i.e., an increase of one standard deviation in the proportion of co-opted directors reduces GHG emissions by 0.27. Additional analysis reports that an increase of one standard deviation in co-opted boards reduces direct and indirect GHG emissions by 0.37 and 1.3, respectively. This implies that firms with co-opted boards ensure the sustainability of their own operations while also making their partner firms environmentally sustainable. Further analysis documents that the influence of co-opted directors on GHG emissions is more pronounced for firms that tie executives’ compensation with ESG performance. Our study provides policy implications for regulators against a background of public outcry and stakeholder pressure on firms to mitigate environmental damage and implement environmentally sustainable business practices.

For the above, this research simulates the phase-out of coal-fired thermoelectric generation by solar and wind energy with an intersectoral model. Previous literature using a traditional input‒output model can evaluate only the effects of increased renewable energy investment. In contrast, this study is novel because it uses a mixed input‒output model that also allows the production of the thermoelectric, solar, and wind sectors to be exogenously modified. The results show that net national production rises by USD 977 million since the drop in thermoelectric energy is more than compensated by the investment and production in renewable energies. However, employment is reduced by 24 thousand jobs. In addition, replacing coal-fired thermoelectric plants would reduce CO2 emissions at the national level by 37%. The magnitude of the emissions reduction under this climate policy is much higher than the reduction yielded by carbon taxes, environmental taxes on multiple pollutants, and renewable energy subsidies previously evaluated in Chile by other studies. Thus, it is concluded that this policy is more compatible with carbon neutrality. Finally, in the cities where coal-fired thermoelectric plants are located, the social health benefits from lower premature mortality are valued at USD 27 million.

Emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) should be reduced to overcome the problems of global warming and climate change. The applications of negative emission technologies (NETs) are proposed to reduce terrestrial CO2 and are identified as one of the prominent options for the energy system transition. Most negative emission technologies require energy to function, which has to be produced from additional energy sources. Understanding the interdependence of the energy sources and NETs for planning the carbon-constrained energy sector is essential. A novel graphical approach, founded on the concepts of Pinch Analysis, to decarbonize the energy sector is purported in this paper. The proposed method determines the minimum integration of negative emission technologies required to attain the allowed CO2 emission limit while satisfying the energy demand. Four different examples are used to show the applicability of the suggested approach with different NETs: carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), and direct air capture (DAC). In these examples, renewable-based energy sources, fossil-based energy sources, as well as energy-producing negative emission technologies are used as compensatory energy sources. The proposed graphical approach has the potential to be used as a planning tool to decarbonize the energy sector involving interdependent energy sources and NETs.

This study examines 233 papers from the Scopus database to shed light on a systematic road to this theme's main features and recurrent issues by adopting bibliometric and coding analyses. The main results show an expansion of publications from 1999 to 2022, which is related to the increased publications and scientific productivity of researchers on this topic and factors such as energy crises and restrictive oil price policies.

In the process of promoting green development, the system of accountability audit of natural resource (AANR for short), which has a supervisory role, is an innovative policy attempt with Chinese characteristics, and pollution emissions are a key factor in assessing the effectiveness of the policy.

To date, no commercial-scale shaft furnace using H2 has been established, due to the lack of corresponding understanding. In this work, a continuum-based shaft furnace model is developed, which considers the multi-phase flows of gas and solid, heat and mass transfer as well as key chemical reactions in the direct reduction process. It is validated by comparing the simulated performance indicators with those measured in the plant. Using the model, the effects of the pressure at the cooling gas outlet have been studied. The results show that the pressure at the cooling gas outlet has a significant impact on in-furnace gas flow, which should be carefully controlled to separate the reducing and cooling gas effectively. As for the product, the carburization and metallization of direct reduced iron can also be optimized through proper control of the pressure at the cooling gas outlet. On this basis, under the same injection rate, the production using H2 is compared with the normal one using reformed natural gas, under their respectively optimized conditions. It is shown that the production with H2 delivers direct reduced iron with less carburization and metallization. Charging large-sized pellets into the furnace centre can solve the problems to a degree by improving the gas flow distribution in the reducing zone.

The sniffing method is the most accurate SET technology. In this study, eight SETs based on the sniffing method were built in Tianjin Port. The concentrations of CO2, SO2, and NOx in ship exhausts were monitored from 1 May to 31 August 2021. An automatic data algorithm was developed to identify peak signals of CO2, SO2, and NOx, calculate the S content of ship fuel, and trace emissions from ships. First, an automatic recognition algorithm for a gas-sniffing signal based on the incremental correlation threshold was established. Second, an automatic calculation algorithm for the S content of ship fuel based on the time series of SO2 peak was generated. Finally, the traceability-locking algorithm for emissions from ships was created by calculating the plume path integral. The recognition rate of the wave-crest signal was demonstrated to be more than 95%, and the positioning error of the ship was estimated at ∼100 m, which could satisfy the accuracy requirements of ship identification. Overall, the peak data of the curves of the gas concentrations monitored (n = 24,292) were obtained during the four-month operation of the SETs. The detection rate of ship exhaust was 62.2%, and the emission reduction of SO2 was 44.6 tons. The accuracy and validation of the algorithm were tested in surveillance practice in Tianjin Port. The SET and automatic data algorithm for SO2 emissions significantly promoted the efficiency of supervision and the emission reduction of SO2. Thus, a continuous online, unattended, and low-cost supervision strategy for the S content of ship fuel without boarding was established.

Investigating the moderating role of technological progress and financial development ";" This study evaluates the effects of military expenditures (MEX) on environmental pollution, as well as the moderating role of factors such as financial development and technological progress for 15 NATO member countries under the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) hypothesis. Using the CS-ARDL estimator, the study analyzes the effects of MEX, income, energy consumption, financial development, and technical progress on carbon emissions spanning the period from 1991 to 2018. Additionally, interaction terms are employed to regularize the moderating effects of financial development and technical advancement. The results show that income, energy consumption, and MEX all contribute to a rise in emissions. It is also found that the financial sector does not eradicate the detrimental ramifications of MEX on the environment, but that technological progress has a moderating effect. A 1% increase in the interaction of technological progress with the military sector reduces environmental degradation by 0.36, but a 1% augment in the interaction of the financial sector with the military sector increases carbon emissions by 0.41%. For this reason, it is imperative to evaluate and revise the financing of MEX of NATO countries from an environmental perspective for sustainable development. Furthermore, as long-run income elasticity in NATO countries is lower than the short-run one, the EKC hypothesis is valid. Based on the overall findings, the study suggests that NATO allies should incorporate the benefits of income growth and technological development into their environmental policies to offset the negative effects of MEX.

It was of great practical significance to study the trends of pollution sources and source-specific health risks of PM2.5-bound trace elements under long-term policies implementation, which in turn can not only gain insight into the substantive impact of policies, but also provide accurate guidance for future environmental management. In this study, winter PM2.5 samples were collected in Baoding City in northern China from 2016 to 2020, and variations in pollution sources and source-specific health risks of trace elements in PM2.5 were comprehensively analyzed. The results demonstrated that the concentrations of 10 elements displayed a declining trend, especially those of As, Sn, Zn, Sb, and Cd. By contrast, the concentration of Cr increased (except in 2020). Although the non-carcinogenic risk (NCR, including dust source) and carcinogenic risk (CR) from coal combustion and industrial emissions had decreased in the past five years, the NCR and CR still exceed the widely accept level for both adults and children in the winter of 2020.

Instead of traditional production-based inventories, we achieve CO2 emissions inventories based on intermediate inputs and final consumption to analyze the connected environmental impacts. In addition, we adopt the available data up to date to construct inventories of carbon emissions involved in imports and exports from different sectors. The results show that global carbon emissions could be decreased by 6.01% during the COVID-19, while export carbon emissions remained basically unchanged. As a result, imported carbon emissions fell by 5.2%, with the energy products sector most affected by the pandemic. Transport sector witnessed 18.42% carbon emission reduction. The impact of developing countries with a large proportion of resource-based industries is comparatively higher than that of developed countries with the technological advantage.

Within an SPS, the configurations of driving devices have significant impacts on the steam balance, energy efficiency, and economic costs. As process industries are working towards the goal of carbon neutrality, optimizing the configurations of driving devices has the potential to reduce carbon emissions from an SPS. However, not much attention has been paid in the past to explore the methodology and effects of optimizing driving devices in an SPS. This study proposes a mixed-integer linear programming model for the new design and revamping of an SPS under carbon neutral challenges.

One of the most important issues of environmental pollution is air pollution, with production and transportation contributing a significant number of emissions. Considering the various warnings about the excessive increase in the amount of carbon dioxide on the planet, it is necessary to investigate the solutions to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide. On the other hand, in the production cycle, providing more comprehensive models and finding more optimal designs will play a significant role in reducing energy consumption and increasing profitability. Models with the most uncertain parameters are more practical and closer to the real world. In this paper, we consider a multi-objective stochastic programming approach for green supply chain design under uncertainty. Demands, supplies, processing, transportation, shortage, and capacity expansion costs are all considered uncertain parameters. At the same time, environmental approaches to reduce air pollution, (specifically reducing carbon dioxide emissions), are presented. Our multi-objective model includes the minimization of the sum of the total cost, the minimization of the variance of the total cost, the minimization of the financial risk or the probability of not meeting a certain budget, and the minimization of the amount of pollution consequent of production and transportation machines. In the following case study, a three-tier supply chain with four suppliers, four production centers, and three product distribution centers with uncertain demand, suppliers, processing, transportation, cost shortages, and capacity development are examined. To solve the model, two meta-heuristic algorithms (multi-objective genetics with faulty sorting and particle swarming) have been developed. The computational results and optimal designs of the supply set were obtained after the implementation of the algorithms, and finally, by performing Sensitivity Analysis and statistical tests, showed that there are two algorithms with good performance and in most cases, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA-II) is superior to the Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO).

After employing Driscoll- Kraay's standard errors for random effect (RE) with individual effects for the examination, the results indicate that the region's level of economic complexity favors environmental sustainability. Contrarily, the economic complexity outlook spurs GHG emissions, thus suggesting that future performance of the region's economic complexity could be detrimental to its ecosystem. Another similar, and undesirable observation is that the increase in urban population hampers environmental quality as it causes a surge in GHG emissions. Meanwhile, the results then conclude that economic growth, economic complexity, and environmental-related technologies are found to be potent drivers of environmental sustainability as the indicators exert negative pressure on GHG emissions in the Nordic region.

The relationship between commercial building life-cycle carbon emissions and urban form factors at the block scale and the spatial differentiation of building carbon emissions in commercial blocks remain unclear. In this study, a calculation method for building life-cycle carbon emissions in urban commercial blocks was established using (1) GIS technology to establish a commercial district building model and urban form factors and (2) block model classification according to architectural layout and combination as well as typical layout pattern extraction through morphological type.

In total, 7 scenarios are presented in the analysis. In scenarios 1–4, the biogas is upgraded on-site by the digester operator, the biomethane is collected by the haulage vehicle(s) and transported to a single depot. The impact of an additional depot on vehicle routing is investigated in scenarios 5 and 6. Scenario 7 investigates the use of a mobile-upgrading and compression unit, which would allow biogas plant operators to forego the installation and operation of biogas upgrading facilities. In scenario 3 (which considers the largest capacity biomethane haulage vehicles and a single delivery depot) all 100 anaerobic digestion plants are visited over the course of one week using 4 routes, with a total aggregated distance travelled of 205 km. Scenario 7 requires a total routing distance in excess of 613 km to visit all 100 biogas plants and requires long routing times and periods of downtime at each site due to the slow upgrading speed of the mobile unit.

We explore the impact of the policy on agricultural carbon emissions reduction (ACER) using the propensity score matching and differences-in-differences (PSM-DID) methods with a series of robustness tests based on the panel data of prefecture-level cities in China from 2011 to 2020. The results indicate that: (1) the policy significantly reduces carbon emissions and impacts carbon emission sources, with the results passing the robustness tests. (2) According to the mechanism test, agricultural financial support mediates carbon emissions reduction, and the policy reduces these emissions by decreasing the intensity of fiscal support. (3) The heterogeneity analysis illustrates that the carbon emissions reduction effect is more evident in cities with a small urban-rural income gap and a high proportion of agricultural output value. Finally, we provide suggestions to reduce carbon emissions from the perspective of national and local governments. This paper is particularly relevant for achieving sustainable agriculture development. ";"2023-06-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623011630";"96";"Emissions"

A combination of fee and subsidy policy is regarded as cost-effective, but limited research was conducted on construction equipment. For this, the study sets up different scenarios to simulate the policies influencing contractors' selection of construction equipment. It also compares emissions reduction and government cost under different policy scenarios. The results of the earthwork case study in a Hong Kong public project show that the combined policy of fee and subsidy can achieve the same emission reductions of particulate matter (19.52 kg) and nitrogen oxide (83.78 kg) at a lower subsidy level (HK$3967) than the subsidy-only policy (HK$7934). The reduction of particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions is 0.59 kg and 68.45 kg through the fee-only policy, which is less than the combined policy. The sensitivity analysis results indicate that the contractor's budget can influence the government cost, and the different level of subsidy and fee can influence the emissions reductions. It is suggested that the implementation strategy of the combined policy should consider the budgets of contractors and governments. The proposed methods and findings can provide decision-making references for reducing emissions from construction equipment in different economies.

Production and distribution are the core sections of the supply chain, and integrated scheduling of production and distribution has received increasing research interest because of its great potential to enhance operational performance. Distributed production has gained popularity in recent years. However, distribution strategies compatible with distributed production have not been considered. In this paper, we investigated carbon-efficient integrated scheduling of distributed production and distribution considering shared transportation resource. Particularly, the shared transportation resource strategy, which allows vehicles to serve customers from various depots, enables a more flexible distribution than the traditional method. A bi-objective model is constructed to minimize total carbon emission and completion time simultaneously. To address the computational challenge, an enhanced multi-objective teaching–learning-based optimization (EMTLBO) algorithm is proposed. In EMTLBO, several heuristic rules are introduced to obtain high-quality initial solutions and neighborhood structures are designed for efficient neighborhood search. The comprehensive experiments have demonstrated that (1) the proposed enhancement strategies are effective, (2) the overall performance of EMTLBO is superior to seven well-known algorithms in solving this problem, and (3) the shared transportation resource strategy considerably reduces carbon emission during distribution stage, leading to average decreasing of 41.0 %, 70.6 %, and 41.5% for the instance sets.

The impact of top management team information-knowledge faultline on enterprise green transformation ";" Green governance has gradually become an important issue all over the world. Surprisingly, in today’s escalating global environmental problems, we still know little about how the management affects enterprise green and sustainable development. Given this, the core purpose of this article is to analyze whether the reasonable “splitting” of the top management team based on information and knowledge can be considered as a feasible path for enterprises to go green. Based on the upper echelons theory and life cycle theory, this article empirically tests the Chinese listed companies from 2011 to 2020 through a high-dimensional fixed effect model. The results show that top management team information-knowledge faultline significantly promotes green transformation of enterprises. Diversification has a negative moderating effect on the relationship between the two, while industry pollution degree has a positive moderating effect. Another important result is that the top management team information-knowledge faultline in the growing and mature enterprises significantly promotes green transformation. However, this promotion effect does not exist in recession enterprises. This article proves theoretically and empirically that it is effective to promote enterprise green transformation through top management team “splitting” which provides a valuable reference for enterprises and governments determined to improve environmental sustainability.

Increased economic activity is bound to significantly affect environmental quality. However, academic empirical evidence on the effect of international trade on environmental quality is inconsistent. Moreover, there is need to further clarify the specific effect paths. Based on data from various cities in China, this study examines the direction and potential effect mechanisms of China's international trade activities on the environmental status represented by carbon dioxide using the Staggered Differences-in-Differences method, considering the opening of the CHINA RAILWAY Express as an entry point. The opening of the CHINA RAILWAY Express promotes environmental pollution in Chinese cities; this finding still holds after a series of placebo and robustness tests. A study of the mechanism of influence between the two suggests that the opening of the CHINA RAILWAY Express increased environmental pollution at the city level in China by promoting industrial agglomeration and improving green technology innovation. A study based on regional heterogeneity showed that the opening of the CHINA RAILWAY Express insignificantly negatively affected environmental quality in eastern China but significantly increased environmental pollution in the central and western regions. Further examination of the spoke network effect of the environmental pollution effect of the CHINA RAILWAY Express revealed that the opening of the CHINA RAILWAY Express in one city significantly negatively affected the environmental quality of all cities within a distance of 200 km.

Based on the inventory, the life-cycle environmental and social economic impacts of CFH since 2011 were analyzed. Temporospatial variations, driving factors, and optimal heat combinations were further explored.

The social cost in 2020 decreased to $ 139.7 billion in 2020 compared with $ 149.9 billion in 2017. Scattered heating activities only comprised only around 27% of heating fuel coal consumption but accounted for 60% of the total social costs. Region-specific heating policies are necessary because driving factors significantly vary among cities. Promoting central heating systems in most parts of China has mitigated the conflict between social costs and heating demand.

Therefore, this study applied the data of dairy farming in 28 provinces (cities and districts) in China from 2004 to 2020. We adopted the life cycle assessment and spatial Durbin model to explore the impact of industrial agglomeration on carbon emissions of dairy farming. We reached the following conclusions: Firstly, there were significant regional differences in carbon emissions from dairy farming Chinese during the investigation period, and the total amount showed a trend of ""first increase, then decrease"". And there was still great uncertainty in the future carbon emission trend. Secondly, Industrial agglomeration has an N-type nonlinear effect on carbon emissions from dairy farming, i.e., as the level of industrial agglomeration increases, the carbon emissions from dairy farming show a three-stage characteristic of ""first increase, then decrease, then increase"". The inflection points of the ""N"" curve were 2.124 and 5.753, respectively. Thirdly, industrial agglomeration had a significant spillover effect on carbon emissions from dairy farming, which was manifested in inter-regional spillover and intra-regional spillover mergers. In general, we focus on the impact of industrial agglomeration on carbon emissions from Chinese dairy farming from the perspective of research, which confirms the nonlinear characteristics of the ""emission reduction effect"" of industrial agglomeration on Chinese dairy farming.

Graph Neural Networks have recently emerged for various classification and estimation tasks on graph-structured data. A Spatially Attentive Cluster-based Graph Neural Network-enabled PM2.5 concentration forecasting model (SA-GNN) is proposed to predict short-term PM2.5 concentrations by considering monitoring stations as nodes of a graph structure and exploring their spatial relationships. This modeling procedure takes into account relevant meteorological variables like wind speed, wind direction, relative humidity etc. An efficient clustering-based spatiotemporal feature extraction method is proposed within a graph neural network setting. This technique makes use of cluster-wise separated graph-structured spatiotemporal features by utilizing disjoint intermediate spatiotemporal GRU networks in order to handle spatial heterogeneity.

Based on panel data of 285 cities in China from 2009 to 2019, the induced effects of dual pilot policies for low-carbon cities and innovative cities (dual pilot policies) on residents' low-carbon choices are examined with the help of double-difference method, and their mechanisms of action and heterogeneity are further analyzed. The results show that: ①the dual pilot policy is more effective in promoting green lifestyle changes among residents than non dual pilot cities, and this such effect is positively correlated with time; ② the dual pilot policy has a stronger role in promoting green lifestyles than the single pilot innovative city and the single pilot low-carbon city, and the two policies have synergistic effects. In terms of the sequence of pilot projects, the quality of green lifestyles of city residents is significantly improved by implementing the low-carbon pilot first and then the innovative city pilot policy. ③As for the influence mechanism, the dual pilot policy mainly encourages residents to adopt a more environmentally friendly lifestyle by optimizing the energy consumption structure rather than through the intermediary mechanism of expanding the supply of environmentally friendly goods; ④The impact of the dual pilot policy on residents' green lifestyles is regionally heterogeneous, with the promotion effect being more pronounced in eastern and central cities and heating cities in the north.

In this paper, the CE intensity of electricity generation (CEIE) in 30 provinces from 2000 to 2019 is calculated, and the temporal evolution and spatial distribution characteristics of CEIE are discussed. Then, the spatial spillover effect of each driving factor on CEIE is calculated using the spatial Durbin model. The CEIE reveals a first increasing and then decreasing trend, and the regional differences gradually decrease. Simultaneously, the CEIE has a significant positive spatial correlation, and the overall spatial distribution pattern is high in the northeast and low in the southwest of the country. Economic development and foreign trade both inhibit CEIE, while electricity consumption, research and development, unit operation level, and power structure all promote CEIE. Each driving factor's influence on regional CEIE exerts a spatial spillover effect. Among them, the spatial positive spillover effects of industrial structure and environmental protection investment are the most obvious, while the spatial spillover effects of other driving factors are not apparent.

The construction investment of 43.8 billion Yuan is needed to complete the retrofit of production lines when the pollutant emission limit value is set as 10 mg/m3, 35 mg/m3 and 50 mg/m3 for PM, SO2 and NOx, which is 6 times of that when the pollutant emission limit value is set as 10 mg/m3, 50 mg/m3 and 100 mg/m3. However, the cost per unit equivalent of pollutant abatement of the former is only 36% of the latter. The emission reduction potential of CO2 in six scenarios is 0.4%–0.6%, indicating that the ultra-low pollutant emission retrofit in cement kiln has limited effect on CO2 emission reduction potential. Comprehensive analysis of emission reduction potential and cost-benefit, it is more economical and reasonable for China cement kilns to choose the path of ultra-low emission retrofit in scenario 4.

The provision of effective, cost-effective energy solutions and the assurance of energy security without producing emissions depend on technological innovation. Power electronics technologies are wildly used for reliably and efficiently interfacing renewable energy sources with the grid and realizing system control and grid decarbonization. Moreover, the energy industries around the world are now implementing inverters in large scale renewable energy plants and grid systems that operate on medium voltage to meet the global energy demand. Medium-voltage inverters in this regard are applied frequently to wide range of renewable energy applications and grid integrations due to their superiorities over conventional low-voltage inverters. Although several reviews have been conducted for low voltage inverters, state-of-the-art configurations and energy management schemes of medium voltage inverters in renewable integrations and grid decarbonization have not yet been thoroughly investigated and comprehensively reviewed. In the light of this, the manuscript aims to provide a comprehensive review of the cutting-edge medium voltage inverter technology from the perspectives of structural analysis, model development, major findings, research gaps, and their applications in grid integration of renewable energy sources and grid decarbonization. Furthermore, it provides thorough analyses of the framework, strengths, limitations, and mathematical models of energy management schemes developed for these inverters. Overall, the discussions, analyses, concerns, and recommendations can help researchers, practicing engineers, and decision-makers with useful references and directions on the emerging renewable integrated inverter applications on grid decarbonization for a cleaner future.

However, making accurate prediction is challenging because the carbon price is highly nonlinear and nonstationary due to complex influential factors. Thus, we propose a multifactorial hybrid forecasting framework, ET-MVMD-LSTM, to integrate three advanced algorithms for a reliable multi-step ahead prediction of the carbon price. First, extremely randomized tree (ET) is used to determine the optimal input variables for the modeling to follow. Then, multivariate variational mode decomposition (MVMD) is executed to simultaneously decompose the screened input variables into relatively regular sub-modes, which reflect characteristics at different scales. Subsequently, long short-term memory (LSTM) with a stable forecasting ability is employed to model each mode individually to effectively extract the long-term trend and short-term fluctuation features. The final forecast is reconstructed by the ensemble of the predictions of all sub-modes. Last, systematical studies on two European Union Emissions Trading Scheme carbon price datasets indicate that the proposed ET-MVMD-LSTM framework outperforms several advanced baseline models in terms of accuracy and stability, which prove the framework is deemed promising and practical for carbon price prediction.

The investigation adopts an augmented Stochastic Impacts by Regression on the Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) framework and employs an instrumental variable approach and instrumental variable-quantile regression models for the sampled nations. Whilst several Foreign Direct Investment entry modes are shown to have varying effects, the results demonstrate that capital inflows via greenfield foreign direct investment and net foreign direct investment raise emissions in all nations, confirming the Pollution Haven Hypothesis. Also, the unrestricted inflows of capital via greenfield projects could increase environmental degradation overtime and the detrimental impact could spread to other sectors of the economy. Moreover, our study demonstrates that capital inflow through cross-border mergers and acquisitions is a significant contributor to decarbonisation throughout the analysed nations, confirming the halo hypothesis, with quantile results revealing diverse effects across national emission profiles. The results are robust to different model specifications of the independent variables and estimation methods. Based on the empirical findings, several policy implications are suggested for theory and practice on cleaner production and sustainability in the countries and multinational companies. This study recommends policy measures to regulate the inflow of polluting assets and incentives to contribute to decarbonisation solutions.

Carbon capture, oxygen blast furnaces and top gas recycling technologies, among others, have been deeply studied as low carbon solutions. In this paper, a novel integration of carbon capture and power to gas technologies in the steelmaking industry is presented. Green hydrogen via proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis and CO2 via methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) scrubbing from the blast furnace gas (BFG) are used to produce synthetic natural gas in an isothermal fixed bed methanation plant. The latter gas is injected into the blast furnace, closing a carbon loop and reducing coal consumption. The oxygen by-produced in the electrolyser covers the entire oxygen demand of the steelmaking plant and avoids the need for an air separation unit (ASU). The novelty of this work relies on the variation of the oxygen enrichment and its temperature in the hot blast, and how it influences the power to gas integration concept. This power to gas integration is compared with a conventional BF-BOF plant from a technical, economic, energy and environmental point of view. Both plant process configurations were implemented in Aspen Plus simulations, assessing the fossil fuel demand, energy penalty, cost and CO2 emissions. Emission reduction up to 34% can be achieved with power to gas integration, with an energy penalty of 17 MJ/tHM and a cost of 352 €/tCO2.";"2023-06-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623011599";"20";"Emissions"

Although the conventional straight porous burner is conducive to improving the flame stability, it still cannot meet the industrial demand. To improve the flame stability and reduce the pollutant emissions during fuel-lean combustion, a divergent double-layer porous burner was creatively proposed in this study. The influences of the inlet velocity and equivalence ratio on the flame stability, temperature distributions, the emissions were experimentally investigated in detail. The results showed that the flame front gradually moved downstream, the preheating zone length increased as the inlet velocity increased. Compared with the traditional straight porous burner, the divergent porous burner extended the blowout limit by 300%. Since the burner was operated under fuel-lean conditions (the equivalence ratio range was 0.45–0.6), the CO emissions were relatively high when the inlet velocity was less than 0.4 m/s. When the inlet speed was equal to or greater than 0.4 m/s, the maximum CO emissions concentration was 132 ppm. The burner showed superior performances in terms of NO emissions, with emissions concentrations of less than 20 ppm under all test conditions. In summary, the great advantage of the divergent porous burner lies in extending the flame stability limit. For clean combustion it is recommended that the burner be operated at a higher velocity (greater than or equal to 0.4 m/s) to obtain lower CO and NO emission levels.

Giving full consideration to how digital trade reduces carbon emissions is crucial for achieving the objectives of “carbon peaking and carbon neutrality” and high-quality economic growth. The “production side” and “consumption side” of social reproduction process are also included in this study for analyzing digital trade and carbon emissions, and the moderating effects of industrial agglomeration and carbon emissions trading mechanisms on the effects of digital trade on carbon emission reduction are also covered. This study conducts the empirical test based on the data of 30 provincial samples in China from 2011 to 2020, with the dynamic spatial econometric model and system GMM estimation method. The findings demonstrate that digital trade clearly reduces carbon emissions. The effect also demonstrates regional heterogeneity, with the north being greater than the south, and the middle and western regions being stronger than the eastern regions. On the consumption side, the mediating effect of rural residents' consumption structure upgrade is the carbon emission inhibition effect, and the mediating effect of urban residents’ consumption structure upgrade is the carbon emission promotion effect. The adjustment mechanism test found that manufacturing agglomeration weakened the carbon emission reduction effect of digital trade, while producer service agglomeration, manufacturing-producer service industry synergistic agglomeration, and pilot policies for carbon emissions trading rights further strengthened the impact of carbon reduction effect of digital trade.

We established a mesocosm system to monitor ecosystem respiration (Re) and methane (CH4) fluxes in the growing season from 2020 to 2021 under different scenarios, including warming and manipulations of species diversity. Overall, the mean Re and CH4 fluxes varied in the ranges of 1.38 ± 0.18 to 46.25 ± 6.62 mg CO2–C m−2 h−1 and 2.72 ± 2.36 to 319.55 ± 96.22 μg CH4–C m−2 h−1, respectively, with the highest values appearing in the middle of growing season. The Re and CH4 fluxes in L-III and L-IV mesocosms showed significant increases of 38.86% and 54.28%, and 56.38% and 107.54%, respectively, compared to the monoculture treatment. The primary controls for this phenomenon were the plant biomass and the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and phenolics. Warming significantly increased the emissions of CO2 by ∼40% during the study period, but it reduced the fluxes of CH4 in 2021. Sustained warming and soil water loss may destroy the original anaerobic environment, which plays a role in inhibiting the generation and emission of CH4 in the long term. Interestingly, although warming has reduced CH4 emissions, a mixture of three and four species seems to buffer more than 50% of this impact, further demonstrating the positive contribution of species diversity. Our results indicate that an increase in species diversity, specifically manifested in the expansion of vascular plants as a community process adapting to warming, can strongly affect carbon fluxes in peatlands and create potential feedback on future climate environments.

Exploring rice-cropping systems with a low environmental footprint and high grain yield and economic benefits is a crucial strategy to improve the sustainability of rice production. Here, life cycle assessment was used to compare the performance of middle-season rice (MR), double-season rice (DR) and ratoon rice systems (RR) based on farmer-reported data in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River of China. The average annual grain yields of DR, MR, and RR were 13.68, 8.96 and 11.97 t ha−1, respectively. Although RR produced 12.5% lower grain yield, it had 41.2% lower global warming potential (GWP) and 33.8% smaller eutrophication potential (EP) than DR, which resulted in lower greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) and reactive nitrogen intensity (NrI). The lower GWP and EP in RR were mainly attributed to lower agricultural inputs, smaller CH4 and N2O emissions and less Nr losses. Compared with MR, RR had higher GWP and EP, but significantly higher grain yield (33.6%) in RR contributed to lower GHGI and similar NrI. In all three cropping systems, CH4 emissions and NH3 volatilization had the highest contributions to GWP and EP, respectively.

The pathways to carbon neutrality are diverse in the regional level due to the different conditions on the energy supply and demand side. How to construct comprehensive assessment index system and evaluate regional pathways to carbon neutrality is an urgent problem to be solved. To fill this gap, this paper evaluates the carbon neutrality pathways of supply-side and demand-side coordination in the Yangtze River Delta region using the Low Emissions Analysis Platform with five scenarios (64 sub-scenarios): Business as usual, energy intensity decrease, energy structure reform, power supply technology innovation and policies mix. The simulation results indicate that: (1) 22 of the 64 sub-scenarios can achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. (2) In energy intensity decrease scenario, an annual 6% reduction in energy intensity could achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. (3) The policies mix scenario can lead to 21 sub-scenarios with pathways to achieve carbon neutrality when the average annual energy intensity decreases by 4% or more. Additionally, the end-use sectors electrification level should reach 64.19% at least by 2060.

Results show that CO2 emissions of 137 Mtpa is amenable to carbon capture and storage (CCS). Additionally, there is a CO2 storage capacity of 91 Gt in 71,907 gas fields, 8 Gt in 16,990 oil fields and 778 Gt in saline aquifers in 51 sedimentary basins and a CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) potential of 10,329 million barrels across Canada. CCS projects of 137 Mtpa can be deployed by 2050 in three steps. First, CCS of 60 Mtpa is proposed between 2020 and 2030 at a carbon tax of $24/t for enhanced oil recovery projects in Western Canada with CO2 capture from natural gas processing and chemical plants. Second, CCS of 63 Mtpa can be deployed at a carbon tax of $75/t between 2030 and 2040. The CO2 can be stored in saline aquifer in Western Canada with CO2 captured from natural gas processing and chemical plants. Third, CCS of 14 Mtpa can be deployed at a carbon tax of $134/t between 2040 and 2050 where CO2 emissions captured from natural gas fired power plants are stored in saline aquifers in Eastern Canada. These CCS projects will generate a net present value of $35 billions with investment of $92 billions between 2020 and 2050. Based on the aforementioned CCS source-sink matching in Canada, policies to incentivize the CCS deployment are proposed.

However, compared to conventional diesel engines, the adoption of pure biodiesel often leads to higher NOx though soot emissions can be reduced. In this study, the alcoholic fuel n-octanol was chosen as the blending fuel in biodiesel. The modeling study was carried out to investigate the effects of blending n-octanol on the combustion characteristics and emissions formation process in a diesel engine. At first, a multi-component reaction mechanism involving 115 species and 489 reactions was constructed to better predict the combustion process of biodiesel and n-octanol. This mechanism was then coupled with KIVA-CHEMKIN to implement a three-dimensional simulation of the engine. The developed mechanisms and adopted models were validated under a variety of conditions. At last, to examine the effects of n-octanol, simulations were carried out by gradually increasing the percentage of n-octanol from 0% to 100% with an interval of 10%. Analysis of the simulation results revealed that blending more n-octanol with biodiesel could lead to a prolonged ignition delay. Due to the high latent heat of vaporization of n-octanol, the temperature at the initial stage of combustion can be reduced which subsequently mitigated the formation of NOx. The higher oxygen content of n-octanol was beneficial for the improvement in power output and the decrease of soot emissions. Overall, B20/O80 blends were found to be capable of achieving more efficient and cleaner combustion in the diesel engine at both speeds.

However, its adoption remains politically challenging, particularly amid rising inflation and energy prices. Despite the need for more aggressive action on carbon mitigation to reach the Paris Agreement goals, few countries in Latin America have adopted carbon taxes and the tax levels are relatively low. A key concern for these countries, is to adequately assess the tradeoffs between stricter emission goals and the potential negative economy wide as well as sectoral and distributive impacts. In this context, in this paper we first propose a step by step approach to enhance an existing dynamic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model for Chile based on OECD's Green model. The contribution of this research is twofold. Firstly, emission factors are estimated and the development of the electricity sector is aligned with the expectations of decision makers. As a result, credible emission and energy sector development forecasts are generated by the model, that are in line with what policymakers expect to happen based on other bottom-up engineering models. Secondly, this baseline is then used in the CGE model to examine the use of a carbon tax to reach Chile's first Nationally Determined Contribution. The required tax level is determined together with CO2 emissions and the economywide, sectoral and distributive impacts. The results allow concluding about the applicability of carbon taxes and possible complementary measures.

Many current assessments focus on tradeoffs associated with monetary cost, neglecting these wider impacts. Here, electric grid dispatch modeling and electricity mix optimization is combined with data on resource consumption and electricity technology costs to compare five different approaches for developing a 100% zero-carbon electricity system in California: minimum critical metals use, minimum solid construction materials mass, minimum land use, minimum freshwater consumption, and minimum monetary cost under present-day policy goals and constraints. The modeled scenarios show that prioritizing minimum solid construction materials mass in developing such systems also achieve near-minimal monetary cost and land use and did not exhibit the worst performance on either freshwater consumption or critical metals use. In contrast, the strategy that prioritized minimum freshwater consumption exhibited the largest land use and materials use of the five strategies. The minimum monetary cost strategy exhibited near-minimal freshwater consumption, but large land use and the highest demand for critical metals. The modeled monetary unit cost of electricity was lower than the 2030 reference for all zero-carbon electricity system scenarios. The results highlight tradeoffs between contributions to different types of environmental impact in developing a zero-carbon electricity system. Notably, prioritizing certain metrics can result in electricity systems that balance these tradeoffs better than others given the existing suite of zero-carbon options. More broadly, the results show that the planning of zero-carbon electricity systems should more explicitly incorporate non-carbon environmental externalities as co-priorities in their development.";"2023-06-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623009915";"2";"Emissions"

Their success relies on the active participation of employees through engaging in pro-environmental behaviours (PEBs). Leaders play a crucial role in their responsibility for managing or influencing employees, but research identifies issues of poor leadership, lack of support from leaders, and inability to motivate subordinates as significant barriers to employees' PEBs. Environmental transformational leadership (ETFL) has been identified as the most suitable leadership style for influencing employees' autonomous motivation, and improving PEBs, and there are thus calls to foster or boost leaders' ETFL competencies. This study developed, administered, and evaluated an ETFL training intervention conducted for leaders (managers and supervisors) in two multinational manufacturing companies in the chemical and automobile industries located in China. Nine (9) leaders participated in each company, and their subordinates (chemical company, n = 112; automobile company, n = 104) provided ratings of leaders' ETFL behaviours, and subordinates' autonomous motivation and PEBs, at pre- and post-training stages. Results show that subordinates' ratings of leaders' ETFL behaviours, and their self-reported autonomous motivation and PEBs, all significantly increased after the intervention, with large effects in the chemical company and above-small effects in the automobile company. This study offers theoretical insights on how leaders' ETFL can be developed or boosted, which is beneficial for influencing improvements in employees’ PEBs and promoting organisational environmental sustainability initiatives.

China's primary aluminum industry (CPAI) is a high greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting industry and is facing a grim situation to reduce emissions. Therefore, quantifying the GHG emissions of CPAI and exploring future development trends are beneficial to the sustainable development of CPAI. In this study, the emission factor method was used to calculate the GHG emissions of CPAI from 2000 to 2020. The result shows that GHG emissions increased dramatically from 65.85 Mt CO2-eq in 2000 to 460.32 Mt CO2-eq in 2020, a seven-fold increase. GHG emissions from aluminum smelting were 363.62 Mt CO2-eq in 2020, which was the largest sub-process of emissions in CPAI, with a high share of 79%. Electricity emissions were the largest source of GHG emissions, accounting for more than 60%, with a maximum of 70.5%. The intrinsic drivers of GHG emissions were explored by the Log-Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method, and the results showed that primary aluminum production was the largest driver of GHG emissions promotion, while energy intensity was the most important driver of GHG emissions suppression in the last decade. In this study, a modified “S"" shaped mathematical model was used to predict the primary aluminum production, which laid the foundation for the subsequent analysis of emission reduction potential. On this basis, five types of scenarios were set based on the results of the driving force analysis.

This work explores a novel synergetic system that integrates membranes, partial biomass oxycombustion and the calcium looping (CaL) process. Polymeric membranes generate oxygen-enriched air (OEA) with an O2 concentration of 39%v/v, which is used for partial oxycombustion of biomass waste. The CO2-enriched flue gas evolves from the waste-to-energy plant to the CaL unit, where CO2 concentration is increased up to 90–95%v/v, ready for purification and sequestration. Compared to only oxycombustion systems, the proposed concept presents fewer technological challenges in retrofitting boilers to waste-to-energy plants. Moreover, this new approach is highly efficient as integrating membranes to produce OEA instead of cryogenic distillation systems significantly reduces energy consumption. A novel integration concept is modelled to evaluate the whole process efficiency and the effect of key parameters on the system performance, such as the temperature of the reactors, the membrane surface area, and the partial oxy-combustion degree. The results show that the so-called mOxy-CaL system has an energy consumption associated with CO2 capture below 4 MJ/kg CO2 (a 31% lower than that for a conventional CaL process), with a higher CO2 capture efficiency than oxycombustion and the CaL process separately. On the other hand, the economic analysis shows a higher CO2 capture cost for the novel configuration than for the typical CaL configuration due to the additional investment cost of the membrane system. Improvements in membrane performance by increasing its permeance and diminishing the required surface area would significantly reduce the economic cost of this novel integration. Using membranes with permeance over 400 GPU would boost the system's competitiveness. ";"2023-06-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623009344";"13";"Emissions"

Numerous studies have evaluated the CO2 reduction effects and economics of CCUs and CDRs; however, uncertainties in these evaluations due to various regional characterizations and future technological transitions are of high importance. In this study, four synthetic fuels (fuels produced from captured CO2 and H2), methanol, methane, gasoline, and diesel, were evaluated by life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic assessment (TEA). Five representative countries with different regional characteristics were selected for the study. A bottom-up integrated LCA/TEA approach was used, involving detailed process simulations to avoid uncertainties and to evaluate future technological transitions based on direct air capture (DAC) and renewable energy. The overarching objective of this study was to provide a transparent framework with a common dataset generation methodology to determine the countries that have the advantages/disadvantages in synthetic fuel production and sale, considering the local operational parameters and large-scale introduction of DAC/renewable energy. Such multiple synthetic fuel analyses across various jurisdictions have not been conducted in previous studies. The results showed that the highest and lowest CO2 reductions were achieved by diesel (average 6.33 kg-CO2·kg−1) and methanol (average 3.43 kg-CO2·kg−1), respectively, whereas the highest and lowest product costs were of gasoline (average 2.96 USD·kg−1) and methanol (average 0.82 USD·kg−1), respectively. The technological transition using DAC and renewable energy showed average CO2 emission reductions of 47% (methanol), 99% (methane), 545% (gasoline), and 621% (diesel). Moreover, in the future, the lowest CO2 emission reduction costs are expected in Germany for methanol and diesel, Australia for methane, and Canada for gasoline.

Although nighttime light data has been proved to be effective in estimating the spatial distribution of CO2 emissions, it cannot estimate the spatial distribution of different types of CO2 emissions (commercial CO2 emissions, residential CO2 emissions, light industry CO2 emissions, heavy industry CO2 emissions, and agricultural CO2 emissions). Based on the local adaptive method, this study compares the potential of POI data and NPP-VIIRS data for modeling different types of carbon emissions in China to analyze the spatial structure of carbon emissions within cities. The results showed that: (1) POI data is much more powerful and reliable than NPP-VIIRS data regarding monitoring ability at the suburbs and mountainous areas. (2) From the point of view of the estimation ability of different types of carbon emissions, in the commercial CO2 emissions and residential CO2 emissions, although the correlation coefficient between the estimation results of POI data and statistical data is not significantly improved compared with that of NPP-VIIRS data, the accuracy of the estimation results is significantly improved in terms of the spatial distribution; POI data has a significantly stronger ability to estimate industrial carbon emissions than nighttime light data.

But to make any innovation into a scale-up technology, a comparative study on environmental emissions is needed. The present study evaluates the environmental emissions from two plastic recycling methods for manufacturing paver blocks (PB) and compares these with the emissions of conventional concrete paver blocks (CCPB). Life cycle analysis (LCA) has been performed on three PB manufacturing processes (CCPB, Plastic as filler paver blocks (PFPB) and Plastic as binder paver blocks (PBPB)) considering the impacts from materials and energy interaction in each step and operation. The impacts obtained from the CML 2001 and TRACI methods have shown that the emissions from PFPB (GWP 21.4 kg CO2 eq.) and CCPB (GWP 16 kg CO2 eq.) are almost 2.2 and 1.6 times higher than PBPB (GWP 9.86 kg CO2 eq.). The LCA study shows that use of cement has major contribution (for instance >80% in GWP category) to overall emissions for PFPB and CCPB. The sensitivity analysis elucidates that transportation distance and truck payload for CCPB and PFPB processes and electricity consumption for PBPB, shift the impacts in greater magnitude (±3–10%) by ±20% variation in input parameter values. The LCA study concludes that the PB manufacturing by complete replacement of cement is more environment-friendly process than PFPB and CCPB.

Here we propose, analyze and validate a BGCPG system under positive pressure for cleaner applications based on a pilot-scale fluidized bed gasification plant and discussed the possibility of higher economic output and operating stability with reduced pollution emissions. Then the effects of temperature, air equivalence ratio and operating pressure were experimentally investigated for parameter optimization. The processes under positive and negative pressure were simulated and compared based on the pilot-scale experimental data, and the effects of the mixing ratio and operating pressure were investigated. Furthermore, the economic and sensitivity analyses were conducted for both a traditional coal-fired power plant and simulated BGCPG systems. The results demonstrated that the gas calorific value, gas yield, and gasification efficiency increased with the gasification temperature increasing, whereas the opposite trend was observed for the gas calorific value with the air equivalence ratio increasing. The positive pressure operation had little influence on the gasification process. The flue gas flow rate increased, and the furnace temperature decreased with an increase in the mixing ratio of biomass and coal. The reduction in fuel NOx and SOx was caused by the decreasing coal content, whereas the decrease in thermal NOx and boiler thermal efficiency was due to the increasing exhaust temperature. Compared with functioning under negative pressure, operation under positive pressure at a 20% mixing ratio could effectively reduce the pollutant emissions of SOx, NOx and dust by 5.64%, 8.8% and 20%, respectively. The generation costs of the BGCPG system under negative and positive pressure conditions were 0.05593 $/kW·h and 0.05582 $/kW·h respectively, indicating that a positive operating pressure would increase the economic benefit of a 660 MW generator by 5.808 × 105 $/year.

The rate of carbon generation increases tremendously due to several issues like transportation, repair, or remanufacture. The generation of faulty or imperfect items increases during transportation. Instead of returning them, the retailer can remanufacture/repair those faulty products in their repair shop and sell them to customers as the new product. Carbon dioxide is emitted from this repair shop continuously. In this study, the retailer remanufacturers faulty items under different carbon emission reduction policies and multi-period trade credit financing to control the shortage. Shortages arise due to imperfect products. Three carbon emission reduction policies are reviewed and compared in the context of different credit financing and investments to find the maximum profit. The adaptation of investment is beneficial to reduce carbon emissions and increase the profit of the system. Nine models are built based on long-term credit financing and carbon regulation policies. Analytical approaches are used to find solutions for complex nonlinear profit functions. Numerical illustrations prove that if cycle time is less than the permitted delay period, the system’s profit is 2.58% and 56.76% higher than the other two cases.

Participants (N = 169) were instructed to compose either a meal to their liking (control group) or an environmentally friendly meal (eco group) from a fake food lunch buffet while verbalising their thoughts (“Think Aloud” method). The groups' meals were compared concerning their environmental impact (LCA data), weight, calories, macronutrients, and food selection reasons. The eco group's meals were lower in environmental impact as compared to the control group. For this, they appear to have followed three approaches which one could interpret as heuristics.

A regression analysis showed that consumers' knowledge about the environmental friendliness of food significantly predicted the environmental impact of the meals. To further improve the environmental friendliness of their meals, the eco group could have selected less animal-based foods (including egg and dairy), and more plant-based foods (including novel meat substitute products) instead.

The model minimizes the mitigation costs, considering a set of measures (energy efficiency technologies and innovative production routes), constrained by the availability of raw materials and the diffusion of new technologies. In addition, the model stands out by incorporating crucial elements for a circular bioeconomy strategy: scrap and biomass supply, as well biomass-based production technologies. We developed four scenarios: business-as-usual (BAU) and three mitigation scenarios aligned with different GHG mitigation goals in 2050: 0% (no emission increase scenario – NIS); 42% (sustainable development scenario – SDS) and 88% (deep sustainable development scenario – SDS+). Results show that GHG mitigation in the short term can be achieved by the adoption of well known technologies (energy efficiency, charcoal-based BF-BOF, and EAF) at negative mitigation costs (between −35.3 and - 1.5 $/tCO2e). Innovative routes play a key role in reaching emission goals but increase the mitigation costs until 2050 (between 23.4 and 43.4 $/tCO2e). Smelting reduction with charcoal is present in all scenarios, reaching up to 24% of steel production in 2050 (SDS+). Direct reduction (DR) is applied to reach more ambitious levels of GHG mitigation in SDS and SDS+. In SDS, DR with natural gas is implemented in 2029, reaching its higher share of production in 2050 (21%). In SDS + natural gas has a transition role. It starts to be used in DR in 2025, increasing until 2043, when hydrogen begins to replace it. By 2050, charcoal becomes the main energy source in all decarbonization scenarios. The results and insights provided by this study can help policymakers towards decarbonization. ";"2023-05-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623008338";"20";"Emissions"

Carbon price is directly related to whether carbon can be effectively reduced. Therefore, accurately forecasting carbon price has important practical significance. Aiming at the nonstationary and nonlinear characteristics of carbon price, this paper proposes a novel hybrid model for forecasting carbon price, which is based on improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (ICEEMDAN), multiscale fuzzy entropy (MFE), complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD), improved random forest by salp swarm algorithm (SSARF), improved back propagation by cuckoo search (CSBP), improved extreme learning machine by whale optimization algorithm (WOAELM) and error correction (EC), named ICEEMDAN-MFE-CEEMD-SSARF-CSBP-WOAELM-EC. Firstly, carbon price is decomposed by ICEEMDAN, divided into high-, medium-, and low-complexity components by MFE. Secondly, high-complexity components are merged and secondarily decomposed by CEEMD, which are still recorded as high-complexity components. Then, SSARF, CSBP and WOAELM are used to forecast high-, medium-, and low-complexity components, respectively, and forecasting results are reconstructed. Finally, EC is carried out using an extreme learning machine to obtain the final forecasting results, and the Diebold-Mariano test is introduced for a comprehensive evaluation of the model. Taking carbon price in the pilot cities of Shenzhen and Hubei as examples, after 6 aspects and 20 comparative experiments, the results show that the proposed model has higher forecast accuracy, with MAPE, MAE and RMSE up to 0.03131, 0.00089 and 4.02e-06 in Hubei, and its forecasting ability is better than other commonly used international carbon financial price forecasting models, providing a theoretical and data basis for carbon pricing and formulating carbon reduction policies in China. The main contributions of this paper are the improved primary decomposition, the use of secondary decomposition, and the innovative combination of three optimal models to forecast carbon price, but it still needs to be optimized for practice.

The lack of monitoring data and effective approaches limits the understanding of building thermal and energetic performance. This paper thus proposes a hybrid machine learning model based on factor generators and an optimization approach to address this research topic, aiming to provide the essential guide for future retrofit and design of large-space public buildings. The four machine learning (ML)-based factor generators are compared using the one-year monitoring data of building facility and indoor thermal management, where the high-performance multilayer perceptron neural networks (MLPNN) model is chosen as the data-driven method to generate the input data as the parent or intermediate populations in the GA optimization algorithm. Such a hybrid machine learning model can solve the multi-objective functions of thermal comfort and carbon emissions. The optimization results demonstrate that this model can achieve a maximum 29% improvement for thermal comfort and a reduction of 386.9 kg CO2 (11.06%) for carbon emissions in comparisons with the human-based management. Moreover, such hybrid machine learning model exhibits tolerance for moderate deficit in one objective. Therefore, the optimal thermal comfort and carbon emissions of large-space public buildings are achieved and thus contributing to the carbon neutrality in the building sector.

However, multi-city empirical research on green city assessment in China has so far been limited, leaving plenty of room for improvement in the understanding of the issues regarding (1) characterization of disparities in the green development status among cities; (2) identification of key factors leading to the disparities; and (3) exploration of potential approaches to promoting green city development. This study integrates comprehensive index analysis, coordination analysis, difference analysis, and correlation analysis into an analytical toolbox, and investigates the green development of 36 major cities in China in 2015. The overall performance of these cities was not high, and showed clear regional imbalance. Relatively small cities, and the green transformation of consumption, deserve more concern in the near future. Other than a conventional comprehensive index, coordination degree brings a novel perspective to understand the green development status of cities. The key indicators contributing to the performance difference among the cities were generally related to sustainable lifestyles and decoupling consumption from resources and environmental pressures. In the end, increase of economic development quality, stimulation of social innovation, improvement of urban infrastructure, and appropriate urban density are proposed as policy suggestions to facilitate cities' green transition.

This study make effort to present feasibility of zero carbon production and transition roadmap for China's ammonia industry. By using IPAC-technology model, this study compiled the production technologies, in-effect policies, and projects-in-pipeline of the ammonia industry, to figure out various technology pathways in sector, explored high/medium/low solar LCOE scenarios, and investigated the impacts of carbon price policy on the transition pathway. From this study we could see that China's ammonia industry carbon emissions peak before 2020 and it is possible to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The results also indicated that all zero-carbon transition technology pathways could be identified over four periods from 2020 to 2050 and electrolysis technology could dominate ammonia supply and help to achieve zero carbon production as early as 2038 in the low LCOE scenario. The production costs output from our model showed that zero-carbon ammonia could be cheaper than conventional ammonia as early as 2030. Even in the high LCOE scenario, ammonia price could be 562 yuan/tNH3, which is much lower than current price, 2652 yuan/tNH3. Carbon price policy has small effect in the transition. All our preliminary results supported the formulation of clean production and sustainable development measures and policies for the ammonia industry in China.

In this study, the environmental and economic implications of substituting natural gas-powered drivers with electric drivers at compressor stations in Canada’s natural gas transmission system are evaluated. GHG emissions associated with the business as usual compressor drivers compared to conversion to electrically driven drivers in 6 Canadian provinces incorporating temporally resolved grid emissions are analyzed. Additionally, the economic difference in the operational costs of natural gas and electricity driven compression is determined and combined with GHG results to estimate the cost of carbon savings for conversion. Results show that electric compressors result in GHG savings in 4 out of the 6 provinces. The large share of fossil fuels in Alberta’s and Saskatchewan’s electricity grids result in natural gas-powered drivers having lower GHG emissions. Operational costs are larger for electric compression and are found to be competitive with natural gas drivers economically only in some provinces if a social cost of carbon (carbon tax) are included. The study shows promising GHG reduction opportunities if electric drivers are employed in provinces where the electricity grid has low carbon intensity.

This study compared the effects of N fertilizer replaced by cow manure at 20.00% (CD20) and 50.00% (CD50) ratios on crop yield, on-field N2O, CH4 and CO2 emissions, soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration, GHG emission intensity and carbon footprint (CF) and nitrogen footprint (NF) based on field research carried out for four consecutive cropping seasons during 2020–2021. The results showed that, compared with conventional nitrogen application (CK), CD20 could reduce N2O emissions by 6.65% and increase the SOC concentration by 48.08% when ensuring yield, although GHG emissions and intensity were both increased by 36.13%–36.44%. The CD50 lowered the crop yield 8.77% as the GHG emissions and intensity increased by 74.32%–74.58% at the same time compared to the CK, although the SOC concentration in farmland was significantly improved by 295.82% due to the higher substitution ratio of N fertilizer. Moreover, the CFs based on the area and yield of CD20 and CD50 were 23.22%–135.52% lower than CK. The NF of CD20 based on area and yield was 10.81%–16.35% lower than that of CK, but the NF of CD50 based on area and yield was 4.82%–14.90% higher than that of CK. In conclusion, replacing 20% synthetic nitrogen with cow manure in sweet maize farmland in the Pearl River Delta could achieve the synergistic technical effects of maintaining crop yield, improving the soil carbon sink and decreasing GHG and RN emissions at the life cycle level. We suggest the application of this method as an alternative fertilization practice for realizing a sustainable sweet maize cultivation system in South China. This study provided a research basis for developing the sustainable sweet maize farming system in the Pearl River Delta in China.

This paper attempts to fill this gap by using technical data from Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) players. For the first time, we present personal work efficiency using a comprehensive evaluation index, the player efficiency rating (PER). The information is then combined with daily air quality data. We find that air pollution reduces work productivity: for every 10% increase in the air quality index (AQI), the average PER decreases by 0.4221, and the effects vary by air pollutant. Heterogeneity analysis shows that at the level of competition venues, the negative impact of air pollution on work efficiency can be weakened at home, while the rising temperature in the competition city can amplify the negative impact of air pollution on work efficiency. At the level of individual players, older players and foreign players are less affected by air pollution. Moreover, we find that air pollution affects work efficiency by reducing total work output and work accuracy. Our research constructs a comprehensive evaluation index for work efficiency, enriches research on the influence of air pollution on work efficiency, and provides a policy basis for identifying groups that are sensitive to air pollution, which might help with air pollution control policy making.

It is crucial to improve carbon productivity through the co-agglomeration of manufacturing and producer services for China. To better understand the effect and mechanism of co-agglomeration, this study uses panel data of 282 Chinese cities from 2003 to 2017 to examine the effect of manufacturing and producer services co-agglomeration on carbon productivity. Further, moderating effects models and panel threshold models are used to investigate the mechanisms of co-agglomeration effect on carbon productivity. The results suggest that the influence of co-agglomeration on carbon productivity is U-shaped with an inflection point of 3.63, indicating that a high level of co-agglomeration is required for carbon productivity to increase. Compared with other cities, cities in the eastern region or with a large scale have lower inflection points. The upgrading of industrial structure, production efficiency, and the production chain has a positive moderating effect on the influence of co-agglomeration on carbon productivity, while upgrading of non-production chains does not. When the levels of capital misallocation and labor misallocation reach the threshold of 1.115 and 1.557 respectively, industrial co-agglomeration has a promoting effect on carbon productivity.

However, prominent concerns like the incomprehensive representation of nutritional quality and the difficulty in replicating existing models continue to limit the application of environmental nutrition. In addressing this, the current study presents an easily replicable and comprehensive nutrition mediated life cycle assessment approach termed the Environmental Impact Weighted Daily Value score (EIWDVs) model. This newly developed model comprehensively captures nutrient quantity in a daily value perspective as a nutritional indicator, and environmental impacts results as environmental indicators in the estimation of a nutrition mediated sustainability score. For validation purposes, the study applied this new model and the life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, respectively, for comparing animal and plant-based foods within two major food categories: dairy products and analogs (e.g., cow milk versus soymilk) and meat and alternative meat products (e.g., beef sausage versus soy meatballs) in a defined future market scenario. Life cycle assessment and environmental nutrition results proved the plant-based alternatives to be sustainable dietary alternatives for achieving environmental nutrition co-benefits. For instance, production of soymilk and soy meatballs could offset up to 64–85% of global warming potential relative to cow milk and beef sausage. About 10% increase in offset values for global warming potential can be achieved when environmental nutrition is considered in dietary sustainability assessment. Nonetheless, the authors challenge the possibility of completely displacing animal-based diets, outlining existing gaps in global capacity and social acceptance, dynamic consumer behavior, and other socio-cultural factors as critical constraints to such a transition. Therefore, an integrated sustainable dietary system that considers plant and animal products with appreciable environmental nutrition performances is proposed as a feasible starting point for a gradual transition to a future of sustainable healthy dieting.

Hierarchical regression analysis showed that the main predictors of green purchase choices were green values, green information seeking, importance of green products, and attitudes towards green products, while religious commitment played only a minor role. A multi-layer path-analysis model depicted an articulated pattern of relationships between predictors and highlighted both the direct and the indirect effects of green values. Overall, predictors explained approximately half of the variance.

To explore the road-map towards peaking carbon emissions of the iron and steel industry, a comprehensive assessment framework, based on steel demand and scrap recycling model alongside energy consumption-carbon emission-air pollutant emission model, was developed. Five scenarios were designed to quantify the potential for energy conservation and emission reduction of the iron and steel industry in Henan Province. The material flow analysis model predicted that the total steel demand will peak at 36.06 Mt in 2020, and the steel demand of main sub-sectors such as construction, machinery, vehicle, appliances and others will peak before 2024. Driven by the boom in depreciation scrap, future steel scrap resources and scrap ratio will show a significant growth trend.

This meta-analysis used log response ratio (lnRR) to perform effect size statistics; assessing impacts of major regenerative (manure, biochar, and two integrated applications) and inorganic fertilizers on GHGs emissions. The results reveal that GHGs emissions were increased by fertilizer or manure addition, but biochar decreased GHGs emissions, with greatest benefit at 50 t ha−1. Combining biochar or manure application with fertilizer emitted CO2 and/or N2O. Applying biochar alone led to 144% reduction in global warming potential (GWP). Paddy-rice with fertilizer emitted N2O and CH4, whereas these were mitigated by wheat with biochar. Fine-textured soils with manure emitted all three GHGs, whereas biochar with coarse-textured soils reduced emissions. Medium-textured soils had reduced N2O (18%) and CH4 (25%) emissions with integrated biochar and fertilizer. CO2 and N2O emissions were highest for neutral and acidic soils with fertilizer but lowest for alkaline soils after biochar application. Soil C:N ratios affected the best strategy to minimize GHGs: for high C:N ratio, fertilizer or manure should be avoided, in favour of biochar. Yet integrated biochar and fertilizer should be avoided for soils with low C:N ratio. We conclude that regenerative strategies using manure risk converting global drylands into major GHGs emitters.

Compared with a typical Korean residential building that uses a gas-fired boiler and air conditioner, the buildings in the two scenarios can significantly reduce energy consumption and emissions. In this context, this study aims to evaluate the performance of NZEBs in hydrogen- and electricity-based energy-supply scenarios based on simulation. An NZEB is constructed considering passive designs, active systems, and renewable energy systems. Subsequently, its performance is evaluated in terms of energy, environmental, and economic metrics, considering life cycle performance. The evaluation results confirm that the electricity-based energy scenario has better energy and environmental performance than the hydrogen-based energy scenario, with each scenario showing energy savings of 62% and 53%, respectively. In the electricity-based scenario, application of the passive design, active system, and renewable system accounts for savings of 48.2%, 21.2%, and 7.8%, respectively. Consequently, achieving NZEB requires more than 13 photovoltaic panels. In case of economic feasibility, all scenarios have positive operating cost savings. However, scenario 1 shows insufficient economic feasibility owing to high initial investment cost.

However, the existing emission inventory does not accurately reflect current emissions because of a lag in the statistical data and the accuracy limit for emissions factor. This study aims to provide a method for estimating CO2 emissions from coal-fired power plants based on an improved Gaussian plume model and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2/3 satellite. We quantified CO2 emissions from six coal-fired power plants (>3000 MW) in China using 14 plumes from the OCO-2 (2014.09.06–2021.10.01) and OCO-3 (2019.08.06–2021.10.01) datasets. Four of the plumes are in good agreement with those from co-located the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument measurements of co-emitted NO2. The estimated CO2 emissions ranged from 31.81 to 99.71 kt/d with correlation coefficient of 0.47–0.95. The uncertainty of individual plumes varied from 8% to 42% (1σ), with wind speed being the greatest source of uncertainty, and the average XCO2 enhancement of all power plants in this study is less than 1 ppm when the wind speed increases to about 10 m/s. After validation, our results show high agreement with the existing emission inventory. However, this study found that the Carbon Monitoring for Action may have underestimated the CO2 emissions from Tuoketuo due to the timing of the update, and carbon brief may have underestimated the emissions from Wujiaqu by ignoring the high emission factor of lignite. This study helps monitor and estimate important point source carbon emissions, which is not only a prerequisite for the power industry to carry out carbon reduction efforts, but also helps develop specific regional carbon reduction policies, which are important for reducing anthropogenic carbon emissions.

This will weaken the reliability of the iron and steel industry (ISI)'s low carbon pathway and undermine the targets of CO2 emission reduction. To fill this gap, this study constructs a bottom-up energy system model that includes iron and steel (IS) production, power generation, and hydrogen production. By incorporating five representative CO2 reduction measures and two electricity structure development paths, namely the orderly phase-out of coal power scenario (OP scenario) and the cautious phase-out of coal power scenario (CP scenario), the integrated impact on CO2 emissions is analyzed. Compared with existing studies, this study focuses more on the uncertainty of power mix optimization and devotes to enhance the ability of the ISI to cope with this uncertainty. The results show that the power mix with a high proportion of coal power will significantly increase the difficulty of decarbonization of the ISI. In 2050, the ISI will emit at least 600.53 Mt of CO2 in the CP scenario, i.e., 124.10 Mt CO2 higher than in the OP scenario, and will require greater reliance on CO2 emissions capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) and carbon sinks to achieve zero carbon emissions. Among the five measures considered, the high proportion of coal power in the power mix will entail a loss in the emissions reduction effect of hydrogen metallurgy, which will cumulatively emit 235.18 Mt CO2 in the period 2020–2050. The active promotion of energy-saving technologies and the increase of the scrap ratio can abate the negative impact of the cautious phase-out of coal power. These findings are expected to provide the government with references to formulate mitigation policies for the ISI in China and in other countries under the uncertainty of renewable energy development.

To better understand the environmental benefits of EVs, we initiate an empirical investigation on how EV adoption affects PM2.5 concentrations. We are also among the first to explore the moderating effects of two meteorological factors, i.e., air temperature and precipitation, and two socioeconomic factors, i.e., industrial activities and province size, on the link between EV adoption and PM2.5 concentrations. Basing on a unique panel data that comprises the PM2.5 concentrations and EV sales of 31 provinces in China, we employ a two-way fixed effects regression model for empirical estimation.

In addition, modern grids are incorporating more demand-side interventions that incentivize electricity end users to temporarily modify their electricity consuming behavior in efforts to change the shape and magnitude of electricity consumption over a period of time. Current methods for quantifying the emissions associated with marginal shifts in electricity consumption are not sufficient given the changing dynamics of supply-side generation resources. This study introduces a novel multiple linear regression model that utilizes historical demand, variable renewable generation, and CO2 emissions data to quantify hourly marginal emissions factors for the years of 2019 and 2020. The developed consumption-based CO2 accounting method includes the emissions embedded in net electricity imports in addition to emissions from in-region generators. The proposed framework is applied to the case study of California Independent System Operator (CAISO), revealing a wide range of hourly-level marginal emissions factors (89–503 kgCO 2 /MWh) during the period of study.

This study estimates the CEICL of 285 cities in China from 2008 to 2019. Then, this paper analyzes the spatial disequilibrium of CEICL, and discusses the spatial heterogeneity of the influencing factors at different levels of CEICL. The results show that the CEICL has an inverted “U-shape”, increasing first and decreasing later, with most cities concentrating on 0.3 million tons/km2 and some cities breaking through 3 million tons/km2. Also, the results imply a relatively large gap in CEICL among cities, despite a gradually narrowing trend of this gap. Among regions, the average annual difference of CEICL is about 0.1–0.4 million tons/km2 for cities of the same scale. Within regions, CEICL decreases with increasing city scale, and the agglomeration characteristics of high-high and low-low values within regions are significant and stable, and the spatial lock-in effect is strong. Moreover, the results infer a negative spatial spillover effect in CEICL in China, and the significant spatial heterogeneity effect of the seven factors (i.e., population agglomeration intensity, industrial structure upgrading, land development intensity, land investment intensity, economic output level, technological R&D and innovation, and ecological resource endowment) on CEICL in cities of different regions and scales.

These stationary, lean-burn engines exhibit increased combustion instability and higher emissions of methane (CH4) and Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) at lower loads, resulting in restrictions on the operational envelope of such engines. In this paper, some of the emission reduction technologies for NGFREs are reviewed. Also, an experimental investigation of an integrated system to reduce emissions and improve the combustion performance of an NGFRE is presented. The integrated system consists of an air management package and integrated sensors including an amperometric NOx/O2 sensor, exhaust temperature thermocouple, pressure transducers and vibration sensors. Experiments were carried out using natural gas and natural gas/propane blends at different load steps, and combustion performance, as well as emissions, were analyzed. For natural gas fuel, the results show that the standard deviation of peak pressure and indicated thermal efficiency (ITE) improved by 67.4 psi and 4.2% respectively, at 40% load. Similarly, CH4 and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) emissions reduced considerably by 84% and 63% respectively. However, CO emissions increased from 8 ppm to 152 ppm. At 60% load, the ITE improved by 3.8% and the CH4 emissions were reduced by 68%. The reduction in VOCs emissions was 63% at 40% load and 69% at 60% load. The findings of this research provide evidence of the effectiveness of the integrated air management system in improving the sustainability of NGFREs.

Currently, 73% of the world's steel is manufactured through the coal-coke-based blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace route (BF-BOF), emitting about two tonnes of CO2 per tonne of steel produced. This review reports the major technologies, recent developments, challenges and technoeconomic comparison of steelmaking technologies, emphasising the integration of hydrogen in emerging and established ironmaking and steelmaking processes. Significant trials are underway, especially in Germany, to replace coal injected in the tuyeres of the blast furnace with hydrogen. However, it is not clear that this approach can be extended beyond 30% replacement of coke because of the associated technical challenges. Direct smelting and fluidised bed technologies can emit 20%–30% less CO2 without carbon capture and storage utilisation. The implications of hydrogen energy in these technologies as a substitute for natural gas and coal are yet to be fully explored. A hydrogen-based direct reduction of iron ore (DRI) and steel scrap melting in an electric arc furnace (EAF) appeared to be the most mature technological routes to date, capable of reducing CO2 emission by 95% but rely on the availability of rich iron concentrates as feed materials. Shaft furnace technologies are the common DRI-making process, with a share of over 72% of the total production. The technology has been developed with natural gas as the main fuel and reductant. However, it is now being adapted to operate predominantly on hydrogen to produce a low-carbon DRI product. Plasma and electrolysis-based iron and steelmaking are some of the other potential technologies for the application of hydrogen with a CO2 reduction potential of over 95%. However, these technologies are in the preliminary stage of development with a technology readiness level of below 6. There are many technological challenges for the application of hydrogen in steel manufacturing, such as challenges in distributing heat due to the endothermic H2 reduction process, balancing carbon content in the product steel (particularly using zero-carbon DRI), removal of gangue materials and sourcing of cost-competitive renewable hydrogen and high-quality iron ore (65>Fe). As iron ore quality degrades worldwide, several companies are considering melting DRI before steelmaking, possibly using submerged arc technology to eliminate gangue materials.

This study develops a Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) model, examines the green technology innovation of listed textile enterprises, and explores its determining factors in order to address the issue of carbon emission reduction in the textile sector. The research sample for this study is obtained from 42 listed textile enterprises from 2017 to 2020. The research demonstrates: (1) the green technology innovation efficiency of domestic listed textile enterprises remains marginal; (2) from 2017 to 2020, the mean value of total factor productivity (TFP) and its decomposition index of listed enterprises in China's textile industry exhibit a downward trend, primarily as a consequence of the slowdown of technological progress; (3) the green technology of the entire industry is in recession from 2017 to 2020; (4) green technology innovation efficiency is inversely correlated with government subsidies, but positively correlated with net profit and asset size of enterprises. In light of the above information, enterprises should boost their ability to innovate with green technologies and implement a research and development (R&D) management development strategy that gives equal consideration to both economic and environmental benefits.

A crucial step in combating the problem of global climate change is encouraging resource-based regions to complete the transition to a low-carbon economy. In this study, the influence factors of carbon emissions in resource-based regions were analyzed using the Generalized Diagrammatic index model (GDIM) based on the development characteristics of resource-based economy in Liaoning Province. Furthermore, this study conducted a Monte Carlo simulation of the trajectory of carbon emission peaking based on the scenario analysis. The results show that different industries need to develop targeted emission reduction programs according to their own development characteristics. In each industry, output scale and investment carbon intensity were the primary determinants of carbon emissions, whereas output carbon intensity, investment scale, and investment efficiency were the primary limiting variables. Other variables had varying effects on carbon emissions in other industries. If the previous economic development trend and emission reduction policies are followed, Liaoning's overall carbon emissions won't peak until 2030, and there is currently intense pressure on the province to cut emissions. The carbon peak pathway in the low-carbon scenario differs from that in the technological breakthrough scenario, and only low-carbon technology innovation and breakthrough can ensure that Liaoning will meet the carbon peak target before schedule. This article is useful as a source of information for studies on low-carbon sustainable development in resource-rich areas and as a theoretical foundation for Liaoning to meet its carbon peak objective.

In this sense, we conducted a comparative analysis of two representative emerging economies in Latin America, considering the external context of the companies (countries' competitiveness levels). We perform a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to focus on multiple conjectural causations that lead to the same outcome. The results show that small firms in a less competitive country carry out high environmental expenditures based on value creation rather than the regulatory environment. On the other hand, large firms in a highly competitive country carry out high environmental commitments to enhance legitimacy and improve external image.

Uncertain decisionmaker preferences lead to the uncertainty of the CEA scheme, hindering provinces from setting climate targets. Thus, we investigate different CEA schemes under various preferences from the fairness—efficiency perspective. We developed a CEA scheme set (consisting of 176851 CEA schemes) based on four criteria: egalitarianism, capacity, responsibility, and efficiency. By constructing a desirability evaluation index, we find the most desirable CEA schemes corresponding to various preferences from the CEA scheme set. The results show that egalitarianism can co-improve fairness and efficiency on top of the existing CEA scheme. Relying mainly on egalitarianism supplemented by efficiency is a desirable allocation mode for any decisionmaker. Regardless of the preferences, these situations generally exist: 1) Guangdong and Shandong will get the highest CEA; 2) Municipalities directly under the central government and less developed provinces will get the lowest CEA; 3) North, Northwest, and Northeast China will bear high emission reduction pressures before 2030. These findings will provide essential guidance for decisionmakers in formulating CEA schemes and provinces in formulating emission reduction policies.

While it builds on previous Decision Theatre work, the new structuring into these three elements emphasizes what is needed for setting up a Decision Theatre for a given challenge. Based on experience with a specific example – sustainable mobility in Germany – it is argued that agent-based models are particularly suitable for Decision Theatres and that the method is useful not only for decision support but also for science communication and co-creation of a deeper knowledge of the system under discussion.

This sector, therefore, needs to be decarbonized to meet the international goals on greenhouse gas emissions. In a cement plant, however, around 60% of the CO2 emissions are hard-to-abate because they come from the calcination of the raw materials. Carbon capture is thus needed to perform deep decarbonization of the cement production process. Among all the carbon capture technologies proposed in the literature, Calcium looping (CaL) is one of the most promising ones. This work analyses on novel solar-driven CaL process for carbon capture in a cement plant. In the system proposed, the energy required for the CO2 sorbent regeneration is fully supplied by a heliostat field. The performances of the overall system were evaluated through detailed process modelling and energy analyses. Primary energy consumption and CO2 emissions (sum of both direct process emissions and indirect emissions due to electricity consumption) were assessed considering different grid electricity mixes and integration levels (IL) between the carbon capture system and the clinker kiln. We estimate that the integration of a solar-driven CaL in a cement plant could be able to reduce over 90% of the plant CO2 emissions. Furthermore, this solution could potentially decrease the plant fuel consumption thanks to the reuse of the exhausted sorbent in the production process. On the other hand, a large heliostat field will be required to feed energy to the CaL process.

CE and EEQ have an interaction and mutual influence relationship. The connection between them includes not only local interactions but also the long-range distance of external systems. It is critical to measure CE and EEQ and coordinate their association in order to increase the effectiveness of CE and EEQ collaborative governance. However, the traditional remote sensing ecological index (RSEI) model ignores the importance of air quality. Furthermore, there is limited current research on the local and telecoupling relationship between CE and the EEQ. To fill these research gaps, this paper first used night light data to dynamically monitor CE. Then we proposed an upgraded RSEI model (RSEInew) to assess EEQ. Finally, the local and telecoupling coordination degree (LTCCD) model was suggested to further investigate their relationship in the Yangtze River Economic Belt (YREB) from 2000 to 2019.

In this study, we investigated the particulate matters (PM) and ozone (O3) pollution produced by open fires from different vegetation types and locations, and assessed their exposure risks throughout China, by using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model combined with multi-source spatial data. Results revealed that open fires significantly enhanced the pollutant concentrations in China, which aggravated the risks of PM2.5 and O3 exposures for 303 million and 405 million people, respectively.

Cropland fires contribute more to O3 exposure in central and eastern China, which could increase the risk for 341 million people.

Deep decarbonising this sector requires a breakaway from current blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) technologies that largely depend on fossil resources. Biosyngas is considered to be a promising alternative to fossil energy and reductants used in existing ironmaking due to its renewability, technological maturity and compatibility for use in existing furnaces. The present work assesses the environmental impacts of biosyngas-based direct reduced iron production followed by electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF) routes for crude steel production. Further, the proposed routes are compared with the other steelmaking routes, including BF-BOF, natural gas (NG)-based and hydrogen-based direct reduction routes by performing life cycle assessment (LCA). The results indicate that the global warming potential (GWP) value for the biosyngas-based DRI-EAF system is 75% lower than the existing NG-based DRI-EAF route and 85% lower than the BF-BOF route. Moreover, the proposed system possibly has lower GWP values than the renewable hydrogen-based DRI-EAF route. The proposed system has an estimated cradle-to-gate GWP of 251 kg CO2 eq./t crude steel, of which 80% is from upstream emissions. Combined with CO2 storage, the GWP of the proposed system is a net negative, estimated at −845 kg CO2 eq./t crude steel for the selected system boundary. In addition to GWP, other non-climate impact indicators are also evaluated to identify potential burden shifting.

The main aim of this paper is to offer a comprehensive analysis of the importance of pro-environmental behaviour drivers across five countries in Europe, namely Greece, Poland, Portugal, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. The survey using computer-assisted web interviews (N = 2502) was implemented in July 2020, the first summer of the Covid-19 pandemic. Hierarchical linear models were employed to analyse individuals’ behaviour, defined as self-perceived declaration of the willingness to contribute to environmental conservation. The results showed that attitudinal and value-related factors are more significant than demographics. Biospheric values and relationship to nature generally affect pro-environmental behaviour positively. Similarly, the experience of Covid-19 exerted a positive influence. In terms of country-level predictors, greenhouse gas emissions were found to have affected pro-environmental behaviour negatively, while the share of renewable energy sources influenced it positively. The cumulative country Covid-19-related mortality at the time of investigation did not have discernible impact.

Facing the spillover and migration of pollution, the cross-regional issue of environmental health inequalities implied in trade networks requires accurate recognition and research. In this research, a city-level PM2.5-related health impact complex network model (PHCNM) is developed. The Community Detection Algorithm (CDA) and the Stochastic Approach for Weighted Link-Structure Algorithm (SAWLSA) are optimized and applied to deconstruct the structures, hierarchies, and characteristics of PHCNM to assess the interactions of environmental health inequalities across regions and cities. At the urban layer, the empirical results suggest that the top 5 cities (i.e., Chongqing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Beijing, and Tianjin) have premature mortality of more than 25000 people each year, which is about 27% of the total. The demographic surge and PM2.5 pollution deterioration are responsible for the worsening health burden of cities. Chengdu, Suzhou, Shanghai, and Hangzhou are identified as development-driven critical cities; Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Cangzhou, and Handan are recognized as pollution-driven critical cities. Thus, city-specific management and treatment of PM2.5 are possible depending on the characteristics of their environmental health inequalities.

As the main source of urban carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, reducing transportation CO2 emission has also attracted great attention worldwide. To reduce traffic CO2 emissions, we propose a complex model that combines multiagent-based models and system dynamics models. From the perspective of the job-housing balance, we explore the interaction among urban socioeconomic development, low-carbon transportation, environmental economic policies (prices, charging policies, etc.), and other factors, simulate the urban traffic CO2 emissions system and policies, investigate the impact of different strategies on traffic CO2 emissions reduction and the economic advantages to the environment, and then select an optimal policy scheme. The analysis results indicate that if we want to achieve the goals of Beijing's future development planning through comprehensive industrial structure adjustment and policy adjustment, then Beijing should accelerate the implementation of the policy of collecting traffic congestion charges. The pricing of traffic congestion charges should be 40 CNY, the parking fees should be increased to 13 CNY, the starting fares of buses and subways should be increased to 2.6 CNY and 4 CNY, respectively, and taxi starting prices should be raised to 17 CNY. At the same time, through the simulation results of the coupling model, the CO2 emissions reduction effect of each scenario in 2050 is better than that of business as usual scenario (BAU). Compared with BAU, C8 scheme has the largest emission reduction, with emission reduction of 19.5975 million tons in 2050, and CO2 emissions reduction intensity of more than 50%. As a result, given a comprehensive scenario, C8 is the optimal long-term development route. Our findings serve as a foundation for key Beijing administrative departments to enhance the jobs-housing link, as well as a guide for the development and execution of environmental and economic policies to reduce traffic CO2 emissions.

";" Sand and gravel aggregate (SGA) transportation accounts for over 30% of the freight volume in China, which is greater than that of any other cargo; low-carbon development can effectively promote the decarbonization of freight transportation. This study presents a four-step evaluation method to assess CO2 emission reductions in freight transportation; the proposed method helps determine the relationship between the policy, CO2 emission reductions, demand, and mode market share. Using Beijing as a case study, this paper estimates the potential of reducing CO2 emissions from SGA transportation under various scenarios. The scenarios are set based on the avoid, shift, and improve strategies; the results of the Beijing case indicate that the CO2 emission for SGA transportation is 920.86 kt, which is approximately 1% of the total CO2 emissions in Beijing. The maximum reductions in CO2 emissions that can be achieved using the avoid, shift, and improve strategies are 0.92 kt (0.1% of total), 560.52 kt (60.9% of total), and 78.59 kt (8.5% of total), respectively. The shift strategy is confirmed to be the most realistic and cost-effective approach for reducing CO2 emissions from SGA transportation. In addition, the implementation of subsidy policies is discussed. Marginal abatement costs under the subsidy scenarios are higher than 224 CNY/t, which is higher than the price in the Chinese carbon trading market.

The current technologies that involve sparging flue-gas carbon dioxide (CO2) directly into closed or open photobioreactors suffer from very limited bioavailability of sparingly soluble CO2 in dissolved form leading to less algal biomass production. Thus, the present study was designed to assess the ability of Chlorella vulgaris as a model microalga to capture carbon from a dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) source like sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) and grow in photobioreactors to high biomass density. With the aim to develop a proof of this concept, Chlorella vulgaris was grown in minimal medium supplemented with varying doses of initial bicarbonate (50–250 mM). The results demonstrated that with increasing initial bicarbonate (HCO3 −) concentration, CO2 fixation rate and algal biomass productivity were enhanced. At 150 mM initial HCO3 −, biomass concentration and CO2 fixation rate were increased by about 145% and 38%, respectively, as compared to minimal medium. Biomass concentration was further improved by implementing a smart intermittent bicarbonate feeding strategy, which resulted in an overall enhancement by about 255%, as opposed to the case of minimal medium. It was interesting to observe that Chlorella vulgaris facilitated its own harvesting by self-flocculation-cum-settling mechanism within a short period of time in presence of HCO3 −. The efficiency of self-flocculation was found to increase by about 55% in presence of 150 mM initial HCO3 −, when compared with minimal medium. High resolution microscopic analyses revealed that microalgal cells were embedded within a self-produced matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) and underwent alterations in topological complexity that may have facilitated nutrient uptake and gaseous exchange across the cell surface, thereby resulting in enhanced biomass production and self-settling. Therefore, strategic utilization of bicarbonate as a source of DIC convincingly establishes the novelty of our rational approach towards enhancing microalgal biomass coupled with efficient CO2 fixation and self-harvesting. This innovative and smart process may be scaled up and translated to efficiently sequester flue-gas CO2 released by thermal power plants and other fossil fuel-based industries through algal cultivation.

We find that driven by clean vehicle polices, the national vehicle CO2 will likely to peak around 2028 with about 1327 million tons, and then reduce by 7.8% from 2028 to 2035. The developed region will peak CO2 before 2030, while the developing region probably peak after 2030.

The case of e-commerce city pilot reform ";" E-commerce has emerged through digital platforms and Internet construction as an important way to achieve low-carbon development in China. To evaluate the mitigation effect of e-commerce, this paper conducts a quasi-natural experiment in terms of the pilot policy of national e-commerce demonstration cities (NEDC) to explore the changes in CO2 emissions of 270 cities from 2004 to 2017 in China. We also check the asymmetry, mechanism effects and heterogeneity. The results show that the treated cities reduce CO2 emissions by 4.1% due to the NEDC pilot policy compared to the untreated cities. The estimated results pass the parallel trend test, robustness tests, and the Goodman-Bacon decomposition. Moreover, the NEDC pilot policy increases the CO2 emissions of treated cities by promoting economic growth (scale effect), and decreases the carbon emissions of treated cities by upgrading the industrial structure (structural effect) and increasing the technological innovation level (technical effect). Furthermore, the CO2 mitigation effects of the NEDC pilot policy are significantly concentrated in the higher quantiles. Finally, the NEDC pilot policy has significantly negative effects on CO2 emissions in “postage-free regions,” southern China, and cities with large e-commerce sales.

Our study applied a multiregional input–output (MRIO) model and structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to examine the spatiotemporal evolution and driving forces of embodied carbon emissions in the specific region of Shanxi Province, an energy-rich region in China, in the empirical study using MRIO data. First, we found that Shanxi had considerable net embodied carbon outflow in interprovincial trade, with outflow increasing from 216.18 Mt in 2012 to 221.60 Mt in 2017. Second, the main driving forces of embodied carbon outflow include technological level and trade demand. We then classified 29 sectors into six categories, including mainly developed, controlled, moderately guided, moderately controlled, cost guided, and maintained to describe the relationship between the net transfer of embodied carbon emissions and value added, and formulated proposed sectoral development policies. Third, the sectors with the highest net embodied carbon outflow include electricity and heat production and supply; metal smelting and rolling processing; and petroleum processing, coking, and nuclear fuel processing. We constructed a coupled relationship model to adjust the technology and scale of interprovincial trade to reduce carbon emissions with lower cost and higher equity.

However, for the power system with high wind power penetration in the future, hybrid CSP-CHP can only partially absorb wind power, and the CO2 emission from isolated CHP can also cause environmental pollution. Therefore, this paper extends the coupled power to gas (P2G) and carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies to the hybrid CSP-CHP integrated energy system (IES), aiming to accommodate more wind power and further reduce CO2 emissions. First, the operation mechanism and mathematical model of the proposed integrated energy system are developed. Second, considering the increase in wind power permeability, a low carbon economic dispatch model to minimize economic cost is presented to optimize the proposed IES operation. Finally, in order to verify the validity of the proposed IES, different cases are compared in the simulation. The simulation result shows that the proposed IES has an excellent performance in wind power absorption and CO2 emission reduction.

This work proposes a novel system for generation of such thermal energy while eliminating CO2 emissions. The system produces electricity, thermal energy, methanol, and carbon black. Combined heat and power (CHP) unit generates high-temperature thermal energy and electricity required by the industrial plant; CO2 produced by CHP and by the plant itself is converted to methanol by using hydrogen produced via pyrolysis of methane, which has recently advanced to the first industrial scale plant. Thermal energy contained in the CHP flue gas replaces utility plant boilers or furnaces of the industrial plant (e.g. a refinery or a petrochemical plant). Two pathways are based on two different methane pyrolysis methods and CO2 removal via MEA absorption. The third pathway replaces MEA absorption with a novel in situ CO2 conversion reactor. Proposed pathways are examined as ways of eliminating CO2 emissions from a 5 million ton of crude oil per annum refinery. The study includes operational costs, capital costs, and material prices in USA, EU, and China. The results show that the proposed pathways are profitable for USA and EU, while for China they are not. The proposed pathways provide CO2 free energy generation from natural gas as an alternative to energy generation from either solar, wind or hydro energy sources.

This article proposes the first environmental quantification of the impact of Building Information Modeling (BIM) in the construction sector. Specifically, the direct and indirect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by a monofunctional BIM to plan road maintenance – a Pavement Management System (PMS) - are evaluated using field data from France. The related carbon footprints are calculated following a life cycle approach, using different sources of data – including ecoinvent v3.6 – and the IPCC 2013 GWP 100a characterization factors. Three design-build-maintain pavement alternatives are compared: scenario 1 relates to a massive design and surface maintenance, scenario 2 to a progressive design and pre-planned structural maintenance, and scenario 3 to a progressive design and tailored structural maintenance supported by the PMS. First, results show the negligible direct emissions due to the PMS existence – 0.02% of the life cycle emissions of scenario 3's pavement, e.g. 0.52 t CO2eq for 10 km and 30 years. Second, the base case and two complementary sensitivity analyses show that the use of a PMS is climate-positive over the life cycle when pavement subgrade bearing capacity improves over time, neutral for the climate otherwise. The GHG emissions savings using BIM can reach up to 14 and 30% of the life cycle emissions respectively compared to scenario 2 and 1, and resp. 47 and 65% when restraining the scope to maintenance and rehabilitation and excluding original pavement construction. Third, the neutral effect of BIM in case of a deterioration of the bearing capacity of the subgrade may be explained by design practices and safety margins, that could in fact be enhanced using BIM.

Based on the balanced panel data of 269 prefecture-level cities in China from 2011 to 2017, we find that a 1% increase in public environmental concern will lead to a 0.049% decrease in PM2.5 concentration, while a 1% increase in PM2.5 concentration will lead to a 1.398% increase in public environmental concern. Meanwhile, there is a significantly spatial spillover effect of both public environmental concern and air pollution to the surrounding areas.

";" Power-to-gas offers a new path for carbon emission reduction by integrating renewable energy hydrogen with traditional chemical process. However, its application is limited by the product fluctuation and high cost of green hydrogen. To further improve the level of energy conservation and emission reduction, this research explored the novel integration process of large-scale green hydrogen system and coal-based cogeneration process. The green hydrogen with a low fluctuation was obtained from the wind-solar coupled power equipped with conservative energy storage system. The results showed that the carbon emission was significantly reduced by 9.2%, while the total operating cost was increased by 18.7%. To alleviate the high operating cost caused by green hydrogen, various waste heat utilization systems were introduced to decrease the utilities consumption. It was found that the total site waste heat utilization was capable of further reducing carbon emission by 13.3%, and the increase in total operating cost can be controlled within 15.3%. Economic analysis proved that the expensive cost could be saved by lower hydrogen usage or hydrogen cost. By incorporating waste heat utilization, the cost increase could be as low as 6.0% and 4.8% under 50% green hydrogen flowrate or 40% energy storage system. With the progress of renewable energy hydrogen production and waste heat utilization technology, the proposed integration process will be more environmentally friendly and economically feasible in the future.

A double perovskite, Ba2Ca0.66Nb0.34FeO6, is proposed for the thermochemical splitting of CO2, a viable candidate due to its low reaction temperatures, high carbon monoxide (CO) yields, and 100% selectivity towards CO. The CO produced by the TC cycle replaces expensive metallurgical coke for the reduction of iron ore to metallic iron in the blast furnace (BF). The CO2 produced from the BF is used in the TC cycle to produce more CO, therefore creating a closed carbon loop, allowing for the decoupling of steel production from greenhouse gas emissions. Techno-economic analysis of the implementation of this system in UK BF-BOFs could reduce steel sector emissions by 88% while increasing the cost-competitiveness of UK steel on the global market through cost reduction. After five years, this system would save the UK steel industry £1.28 billion while reducing UK-wide emissions by 2.9%. Implementation of this system in the world's BF-BOFs could allow the steel sector to decarbonise in line with the Paris Climate Agreement to limit warming to 1.5 °C.";"2023-02-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262300121X";"32";"Emissions"

We conduct game-theoretic models to examine the characteristics and effects of two financial incentives on the supply chain under high emission restriction (HER) and low emission restriction (LER) conditions. Our results reveal that: (1) both the incentive policies fail under excessively stringent emission restrictions and generate lower optimal profit for supply chain members under HER condition; (2) both financial incentives can transform the heavy polluting manufacturer under HER eligible for LER condition; the optimal emission reduction level only touches the passing level of emission requirements under HER condition, while increasing with the government subsidies under the LER condition; (3) under the LER condition, green credit subsidies policy is efficient at increasing social welfare, while price incentives are better at increasing supply chain profits. Further, we demonstrate that it is less expensive for the government to provide subsidies to banks that require compliance with environmental regulations as a precondition of green loans in most cases.

Accurate predictions of NOx emissions at the SCR inlet can help improve the denitrification efficiency. However, the generation and distribution of NOx in a furnace involves complex combustion, thermodynamics, and fluid mechanics processes. The physical-based method for NOx emission models is complex and requires expensive computational resources. To address these issues, deep learning was employed to develop a prediction approach based on the random forest (RF) algorithm and lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN). To avoid curse of dimensionality, the random forest algorithm was utilized to select the importance of the candidate variables. The selected variables were in line with the boiler NOx generation and combustion control trends. The lightweight CNN was developed to build the model that predicts NOx emissions. The key was that a Cross-Channel Communication (C3)-Block was introduced into the lightweight CNN to resolve the issue in which there was no communication between feature maps in the same convolutional layer. This model was named C3–CNN. The predictive effectiveness of the C3–CNN-based model was assessed on the real historical dataset of a 600 MW down-fired boiler. The experimental results indicated that the proposed method reduced the model depth of the CNN (saved 3 convolutional layers, 1.5 times parameters, and 1 times FLOPs than 6-layer CNN) while also ensuring the model prediction accuracy (RMSE = 13.52704 ± 0.21036 mg/m3, MAE = 9.89313 ± 0.18288 mg/m3, R 2 = 0.93337 ± 0.00222), which was suitable for the online optimization of industrial pollutant control and may assist cleaner production.

Enterprises choose the optimal production plan that maximizes their own interests according to the incentive mechanism of the government. We compare green funding and green technology in terms of total emissions, reduction efficiency and corporate profits. The results demonstrate that: (1) government contracts are not always beneficial for enterprises reducing emissions; (2) when the coverage of green funding is greater than a certain threshold, the emission reduction efficiency brought by green funds is better than that of green technologies; (3) when the funding intensity exceeds a certain value, there exists a optimal coverage of green funding to ensure that corporate profit targets and emission reduction targets are met simultaneously.

The beams are 2 m long, simply-supported and loaded vertically at midspan. The impact of using either carbon steel or stainless steel is investigated. The results demonstrate that the carbon steel and stainless steel WAAM beams have 7% and 24%, respectively, lower climate change impact than the corresponding I-beams. It is concluded that WAAM can lead to lower CO2-eq. emissions than conventional hot-rolling, provided that mass reductions of the order of 50% (which are readily attainable) can be achieved by employing WAAM in conjunction with, for instance, topology optimisation.

In terms of liquid fuels, hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO) gained special attention in the last few years due to its good performance in diesel engines, low emissions and renewable aspect. At the same time, bioethanol represents another renewable option for energy supply and has been consolidated in the market for decades. Even though these biofuels are assumed to be environmentally friendly, a complete understanding of their environmental impacts should take into account several indicators, applications and geographical aspects.

The Dual-Fuel application provided a significant reduction in CO2, NOX and PM emissions, but decreased engine efficiency by up to 9.4%. The LCA showed that the palm oil HVO has an environmental performance superior to the soybean HVO and is capable of reducing the Global Warming Potential up to 75%.

In addition, the total production cost was evaluated. On the basis of the evaluation results, process hotspots were identified. Optimal conditions used for TEOS regeneration (ethanol/DS = 18.2) were proposed to improve total process performances. The total production cost and CO2 emissions are 1.7 $/kg DEC, 3.6 kg CO2/kg DEC, respectively.

We illustrate EEIO analysis' usefulness to sketch transition plans on the example of Canada's road industry: estimation of national environmental contributions, most important environmental issues, main potential transition levers of the sector, and metrics prioritization for green purchase plans. To do so, openIO-Canada, a new Canadian EEIO database, coupled with IMPACT World+ v1.30–1.48 characterization method, provides a multicriteria environmental diagnosis of Canada's economy. The construction sector carries the second-highest environmental impacts of Canada (8–31% depending on the indicator) after the manufacturing industry (20–54%). The road industry generates a limited impact (0.5–1.8%), and emits 1.0% of Canadians' GHGs, mainly due to asphalt mix materials (28%), bridges and engineering structures materials (24%), and direct emissions (17%). The industry must reduce the environmental burden from material purchases - mainly concrete and asphalt products - through green purchase plans and eco-design and invest in new machinery powered with cleaner energies such as low-carbon electricity or bioenergies.

Thereby, a carbon-neutral pathway for the road industry must first focus on reducing vehicle consumption and wear through better design and maintenance of roads.

The aggregate embodied CO2 intensity (CI), defined as the ratio of embodied CO2 emissions per embodied value added, has been studied in previous research to evaluate the environment performance and mitigation policies from a final demand perspective. However, there is a relative lack of studies analysing CI from the perspective of border-crossing frequency (BCF), the number of national border crossings of traded products. This paper first analyses the CI in import products of the construction industry at each BCF under a multi-regional input–output framework and decomposes the change in CI in import products into the value-added distribution factor and the efficiency factor under conditions of BCF. The results indicate that CIs in import products of construction industries experienced declines from 2000 to 2014. The value-added distribution factor appeared to have an inhibitory effect only at the first BCF on the growth in CIs in import products of construction industries and prompted growth in CIs in import products at higher-order BCFs. The efficiency factor had a significant promoting effect on the decline in CIs in import products of construction industries but this promotion effect became weaker with an increase in the level of BCF.

Achieving carbon reduction within the warehouse is a problem that needs to be addressed in the layout of the green warehouse. This paper builds a soft path model to study the impact of the improved systematic layout planning method on carbon reduction in warehouses from a low carbon economy perspective. This paper considers two main warehouse layout factors: logistic and nonlogistic factors. A dual-objective warehouse optimization model is designed by quantifying the relationship between logistic and nonlogistic factors, and the heuristic algorithm is used for simulation optimization. Finally, the functional warehouse area is comprehensively evaluated using fuzzy constraint theory. The results show that the established soft path solution optimizes and improves logistics activities such as internal warehouse layout, material handling strategy, and warehouse management by comparing with the traditional layout method. The efficiency of warehouse operation, warehouse space utilization, and energy are improved. The goal of reducing carbon footprints from the warehouse is thus achieved. It is demonstrated that the soft path solution can minimize warehouse carbon emissions and generate positive synergy in terms of environmental impact. This study enriches green warehouse layout design procedures and provides a facility optimization technique with the potential to minimize warehouse carbon emissions, which can help planners combine other green warehouse management tools to optimize operations and reduce carbon in daily practice.

Current steel production routes are therefore expected to undergo a profound decarbonisation process in the coming decades. This work aims to shed light on the role of hydrogen in decarbonising the supply of high-temperature heat in the steel sector by means of an optimisation framework. The model includes on-site hydrogen production using a low-temperature electrolyser integrated with a compression and storage system and gas burners, which can be fed with hydrogen and/or natural gas to cover the process heat demand. The assessment also takes advantage of real thermal load profiles of a scrap-based electric arc furnace steel plant. A sensitivity analysis is conducted on the electricity, natural gas and carbon prices. Cost-optimal maps are then derived to unveil the combination of energy and carbon prices at which hydrogen becomes convenient for heat production in the steel industry. A general relationship to define the cost-effectiveness of hydrogen is also given. The results show that, at current carbon prices (about 100 €/tCO2), the use of hydrogen becomes economically convenient when the electricity price is less than 0.4–0.6 times the natural gas price. In scenarios with electricity prices lower than about 0.10 €/kWh, as could occur with on-site renewable electricity generation, hydrogen cost falls below 6.5 €/kgH2, leading to cost savings of up to 60–70% compared to a natural gas-based configuration. Finally, when total CO2 emissions (direct + indirect) are considered, hydrogen becomes environmentally beneficial if the electricity carbon intensity is below 123 gCO2/kWh.";"2023-02-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623001270";"56";"Emissions"

Fake news, on the other hand, is a growing challenge to this dynamic narrative about sustainability and associated innovations. Notwithstanding few attempts to glean insights from literature at the nexus of sustainability, concomitant innovations, and fake news, the current study undertakes an integrative literature review with the objective of comprehending the repertoire of interactions between fake news, concomitant acts of deception, and sustainability-focused innovations. The review yielded 81 research articles published between 1992 and 2022. This collection represents a highly heterogeneous body of work encompassing these dimensions wherein comprehensive frameworks are rare and empirical works have focused on a limited range of innovations and fake news. The paper organizes the extant literature across four key themes and identifies five crucial gaps that have remained underexplored to date. Based on gaps in the literature, a research agenda with a set of thematic pathways and a holistic conceptual framework is presented to serve as a foundation for advancing research in the domain. This study is one of the first attempts to shed light on the menace of fake news in the context of sustainability-focused innovations and provides the necessary impetus for researchers to investigate empirical relationships and causal mechanisms surrounding the triadic nature of interlinkages between sustainability concerns, associated innovations, and fake news. The insights from this study aid practitioners in evaluating innovations from a novel vantage point and devising strategies to navigate potential pitfalls, while also serving as crucial evidence for policymakers to leverage an optimal mix of policy levers to circumvent sustainability concerns and foster innovations amidst the looming crisis of fake news.

In this study, using a global climate model, regional meteorological model, emission process model and air quality model, a future air quality research modeling system is designed and utilized to explore the air quality conditions over the BTH region in 2050. Two sensitivity experiments with different intensity emission inventories were set to quantify the influence of anthropogenic emissions on the future air quality in the BTH region under the identical representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios of RCP4.5, which is provided by the famous climate model Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Earth System Model with the Generalized Ocean Layer Dynamics component (GFDL-ESM2G). The results show that the annual PM2.5 concentration over BTH under the EIT1 (Emissions for Interim Target-1) scenario is 32.7 μg/m3, less than 35 μg/m3, approximately half of the value under the baseline emission scenario, and reaches the Interim Target-1 by the World Health Organization (WHO), which is also the national air quality standard for annual PM2.5 concentrations in China. The frequency of nonpolluted projects can reach 95%, and the frequency of heavily polluted projects is well under 1% under the EIT1 emission scenario. These results indicate that emission reduction is significantly required to achieve the new Chinese PM2.5 target.

To achieve this, this paper proposes a systematic methodological framework to facilitate optimal configuration planning of an electric-hydrogen micro-energy system with vehicle sharing stations (EHVS). The proposed approach is based on the notion of integrated resource planning, which combines supply side with demand side simultaneously. The problem is formulated as a two-stage hybrid stochastic-interval programming, where the first-stage is aimed at minimizing the investment cost by determining the optimal configuration planning, while the second-stage is aimed at maximizing the expected benefits through optimal operation simulation of the system. The potential flexibility of vehicular demands in response to the rental price-setting has been explicitly considered in this work and represented using an evolutionary game model. Through this, the substitutability between different vehicle demands and its impact on the long-term planning of electric-hydrogen integrated energy system can be properly captured. A hybrid interval-stochastic method is presented to handle different types of uncertainties involved in the discussed problem, wherein the scenario analysis, the interval order relation and the fuzzy preference methods are jointly utilized. The resultant problem is solved with a genetic-algorithm based framework, and implemented in the MATLAB environment. The simulation results show that, compared with conventional independent planning, there could be an improvement in the carbon emission reduction by 24.74% and an additional cost saving of 11.97% achievable using the proposed approach.

This paper starts with the collaborative agglomeration of manufacturing and producer services, demonstrates the impact of collaborative agglomeration on industrial pollution emission through theoretical analysis, and then uses panel data of 285 prefecture level cities in China from 2004 to 2019 to verify the relationship between them. The results show that collaborative agglomeration significantly increased industrial pollution emission, but the effect mainly existed in small and medium-sized cities, cities with more development zones, cities with provincial high-tech industrial parks and the observation range from 2009 to 2015. The results of subdividing producer services show that transportation, warehousing and postal services, finance, information transmission, computer services and software industries have intensified industrial pollution emission in the collaborative agglomeration with the manufacturing industry. Mechanism analysis shows that collaborative agglomeration fosters the city's “low-level innovation preference” and promotes the expansion of the number of enterprises characterized by the entry and extension of the duration of highly polluting enterprises. It objectively forms a “quantity-priority orientation”, thus increasing industrial pollution emission. The above conclusions mean that the development of urban industry at this stage should be based on quality and efficiency, rather than pursuing the disordered expansion of quantity.

The development of various technologies, such power-to-gas (P2G) and hydrogen-based energy systems (HES), enables the integration of these systems with conventional ones in this task. This approach will help improve efficiency and resolve the substantial carbon emission problem on the demand and supply sides. This paper focuses on using hydrogen as a primary source of energy and uses wind turbine (WT) and Photovoltaic (PV) as RES. Hot- and chilled water storages besides a HTS are implemented to improve energy efficiency. Upstream grid and hydrogen markets are connected to this system to compensate for the energy deficiency in some periods. P2G functions as a carbon recycling system by reducing carbon emissions and generating extra heat from its chemical reaction for end-users. The proposed hydrogen-based energy system combined with Power-to-gas (HES-P2G) is based on stochastic programming, and takes into account various uncertainties. The nonlinearity in some restrictions is converted using the piecewise linearization technique. The epsilon-constraint method is used as a multi-objective optimization to achieve both economic and environmental goals. The fuzzy satisfying technique is used to obtain a trade-off solution between two objectives. The numerical results show the impacts of using P2G in HES in reducing carbon emission and operating cost. The current HES can significantly reduce carbon emissions; however, using P2G influences environmentally and economically. P2G will thereby cut carbon emissions by 14.2% and operating expenses by 11.7%. ";"2023-02-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623000501";"12";"Emissions"

However, most of the existing studies only focus on the environmental impact associated with the product itself regardless of the actual usage scenarios and protective performance of products, resulting in unrealistic conclusions and poor applicability. In this context, this study integrated the product performance into the existing carbon footprint assessment methodology, with focus on the current global concerns regarding climate change. Computational case studies were conducted for different mask products applicable to the scenarios of low-, medium- and high-risk levels. The results showed that reusable cotton masks and disposable medical masks suitable for low-risk settings have a total carbon footprint of 285.484 kgCO2-eq/FU and 128.926 kgCO2-eq/FU respectively, with a break-even point of environmental performance between them of 16.886, which implies that cotton masks will reverse the trend and become more environmentally friendly after 17 washes, emphasizing the importance of improving the washability of cotton masks. Additionally, the total carbon footprints of disposable surgical masks and KN95 respirators were 154.328 kg CO2-eq/FU and 641.249 kg CO2-eq/FU respectively, while disposable medical masks and disposable surgical masks were identified as alternatives with better environmental performance in terms of medium- and high-risk environments respectively. The whole-life-cycle oriented carbon footprint evaluation further indicated that the four masks have greater potential for carbon emission reduction in the raw material processing and production processes. The results obtained in this study can provide scientific guidance for manufacturers and consumers on the production and use of protective masks. Moreover, the proposed model can be applied to other personal protective equipment with similar properties, such as protective clothing, in the future.

However, reaching these goals will require a massive reduction in carbon emissions. The humans have to consume food to meet their survival needs. Furthermore, the society's demand for food is consistent with the development level of agricultural structures. At present, reducing environmental costs associated with food to adjust the agricultural structure has not received sufficient scientific attention. Because of this, the present study combines food consumption, climate change, and agricultural structure to design future scenarios based on the widely used SSP storyline. Moreover, in order for China to reach its carbon peak in 2030, this study applies a life-cycle approach to uncover the potential carbon reduction of Chinese residents under different dietary structures. From a demand perspective, this study puts forward recommendations for dietary restructuring and guides the direction of future agricultural restructuring in China. It also shows that a diet structure that replaces red meat with plant foods such as vegetables and fruits will have a more significant carbon reduction potential. The traditional agricultural structure consumes a large amount of food and produces a significant amount of greenhouse gases. Reducing meat and high-fat foods consumption may help reduce GHG emissions produced by food consumption. In addition, reducing the proportion of food used for feeding in the agricultural structure will also help achieve peak carbon targets. The shift in diet structure will advance China's agricultural structure and promote green agriculture development.

We also included globalization, energy consumption, and economic growth to normalize the tourism industry sub-sectors environmental impacts. The ARDL bound testing and Gradual shift causality methods are used to analyze the environmental impacts of the tourism industry for the data spanning from 2001Q1 to 2019Q4. The outcomes indicate that tourism-related food and beverage services contribute to higher greenhouse gas emissions, especially N2O and CH4. However, compared with other sub-sectors, CO2 is primarily contributed by the tourism-traveling sector in the long run. Similarly, the food and beverages services also contribute highly to all air pollutants except PM2.5, while shopping and entertainment is the most significant sector contributing to N2O, CH4, and all other air pollutants in the long run.

Herein, the aim was to optimize the operational conditions for NOx reduction in forest biomass using circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC) combined with air staging and flue gas recirculation (FGR). The profiles of temperature and solid suspension density in the combustor, NO and CO emissions, fuel-N conversion, slagging and fouling tendencies, and combustion efficiency were comprehensively observed during combustion. The main operating parameters are the FGR ratios, optimal ratios of air staging [Primary air (PA):Secondary air (SA):Tertiary air (TA)] and FGR, and supply height of TA in the combustor. Notably, under the optimal operational conditions (air staging ratio; PA:SA:TA = 70:10:30, FGR ratio; 8%, and TA supply height; 8.1 m), the NO and CO emissions were simultaneously reduced to 25.9% and 18.2%, respectively, compared with that for the base scenario which excluded air staging and FGR. Furthermore, a high combustion efficiency of 99.72% was maintained without any ash-related problems at well-controlled bed temperatures owing to the constant solid circulation afforded by FGR.

We evaluated GHG emissions of biobased baby diapers as the most consumed sanitary product, using a biodegradable functionalized protein superabsorbent polymer (bioSAP) and compared them with currently used fossil-based counterparts. Assessment of the diapers also included estimated GHG emissions from the production of the biobased components, transport, and end-of-life combustion of these items. It was shown that only a few of the biobased diaper alternatives resulted in lower GHG emissions than commercial diapers containing fossil-based materials. At the same time, it was demonstrated that the production of the bioSAP via chemical modification of a protein raw material is the primary GHG contributor, with 78% of the total emissions. Reduction of the GHG contribution of the bioSAP production was achieved via a proposed recycling route of the functionalization agent, reducing the GHG emissions by 13% than if no recycling was carried out.

First, the study reveals that financial development depending on the adopted indicator has mixed effects on environmental pollution levels. Specifically, financial development triggers the highest pollution effect via domestic credit to the private sector compared to foreign direct investments, while financial development index reduces environmental pollution. Secondly, economic governance promotes environmental quality by reducing environmental pollution through quality regulation. Third, institutional governance through weaker rule of laws induces pollution, while the control of corruption antagonizes pollution levels. Furthermore, only the voice of accountability supports the pollution-mitigating effect of political governance. On a bloc-to-bloc comparative analysis, governance effectiveness promotes environmental pollution in all the three economic blocs albeit at different magnitudes while the voice of accountability exerts a significant desirable impact on pollution only in the G7 countries.

Current practices for designing structural elements, which are based on traditional design methods, result in building box-shaped elements and consuming more materials than what is structurally necessary. Excess materials can be removed without compromising the structural soundness of the elements while also providing added architectural value. This paper presents an approach based on generative design concepts, genetic algorithms, and the Lagrangian Multiplier Method to design concrete beams that use near-exact amounts of material only where they are needed. In this study, beam designs are optimized to reduce concrete and steel use in reinforced concrete beams. The effectiveness of the approach was demonstrated through its deployment to design a cantilever beam and a simply supported beam. The results of both applications were very promising as the reductions in material costs reached 63% and the related reductions in CO2 emissions reached 57% per beam. This lays strong foundations for expanding the effort to scale this approach into entire buildings.

This paper develops three Stackelberg game models: no fairness concern, with retailer’s fairness concern, and with manufacturer’s altruistic preference, respectively, and then derive equilibrium outcomes to analyze the joint effect of fairness attitudes and C&T regulation. First, the results demonstrate that the retailer’s fairness concern increases his own profit while decreases the manufacturer’s optimal emission reduction and profit. Second, the manufacturer’s altruistic preference not only facilitates a more equitable distribution of overall profits but also results in lower emissions of unit product, achieving a win–win situation. Consequently, the manufacturer’s altruistic preference performs better than the retailer’s fairness concern in balancing fairness and emission reduction. Interestingly, if the manufacturer decides to reduce emissions, the total emissions are lower under a loose C&T regulation; otherwise, the total emissions are lower under a strict C&T regulation.

We evaluated the direct and indirect effects of these options on the carbon footprints of a sample of 715 individuals. Their emissions were calculated using a carbon calculator app that estimates the footprint associated with their consumption, based on financial transaction data from their bank(s) in combination with a lifestyle survey and data from official databases. This data also provides the basis for a detailed analysis of how differences in spending and greenhouse gas emissions in one consumption domain can rebound and/or spillover into other domains. Our results show that these four lifestyle options are associated with substantial net emission reductions, ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 tonnes of CO2eq/cap/yr each. The results also suggest that, contrary to the theory of economic rebound effects, the indirect effects of these practices are related to further emission reductions in other consumption domains, except for people who do not fly, for whom we saw a very limited rebound effect. The sample has on average relatively strong pro-environmental personal norms, which limits the generalizability of the results and calls for further research.";"2023-02-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622053136";"14";"Emissions"

In the aviation sector, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF) are currently produced from various feedstocks and conversion pathways to achieve sustainability targets. A new SAF production pathway has been recently developed, which is based on enzymatic hydrolysis of softwood residues (saw dust), fermentation of wood sugars into isobutene, and subsequent conversion to SAF isoparaffins by oligomerization and hydrogenation. This pathway is currently under consideration for inclusion as an additional annex to ASTM standard D7566. In this study, several biorefinery set-up scenarios including various process energy provisions and co products valorization were considered in order to assess the environmental impact of SAF production. First, a life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted to estimate the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the conversion pathway. Second, the GHG reduction potential was evaluated according to the frameworks of EU RED 2018/2001/EC and CORSIA. Third, energetic and exergetic analyses were performed to evaluate the efficiency of the biorefinery. Inefficiencies of upstream processes, such as for electricity provision, were not considered. Depending on the plant layout, the GHG emissions vary between 18.7 and 56 gCO2eq/MJ. Thus, compared to the fossil reference, GHG emission reductions of up to 80.1% and 79% can be achieved for both frameworks, respectively. Plant set-up comparisons revealed that the highest reduction in GHG emissions can be achieved when using the by-product lignin for thermal energy provision and renewable energy sources (RES) to cover electricity demand. The energetic and exergetic efficiency analyses of SAF as a single product were 11.7%–14.9% and 11%–13.8%, respectively. A lignin-CHP plant set-up revealed the highest efficiencies and has the additional benefit of covering up to 82.3% of the total primary energy demand (PED) via RES. Taking all by-products into account, the energetic system efficiency ranged from 39.4% to 50.1% and the exergetic system efficiency from 40.4% to 56.9%, respectively. The highest efficiencies were achieved with the natural gas boiler set-up and electricity consumption from the public grid. The analysis revealed the importance of utilizing all biorefinery products (main and by-products) to increase the system efficiency of the biorefinery.";"2023-02-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622053896";"13";"Emissions"

This study uses the Generalized Method of Moment model to investigate the effect of an environmental tax on total factor productivity and energy efficiency, and takes the effects as approximations of the effects of carbon tax on technological progress into the computable general equilibrium model as well as considering technology diffusion, to analyze the dynamic impact of carbon tax on China's economy growth. A carbon tax policy negatively impacts GDP at the early stage, but technological progress would make GDP impacts “turn negative into positive” in the late stage. With a carbon tax rate of 100 Yuan/ton, the GDP impact becomes positive from the 4th year and rises to 0.3% in 2030. Not all industries can realize the output of “turning negative into positive,” only low-carbon-intensity industries can achieve a clean transition. Overall, this study discusses the dual effects of a carbon tax on technological progress and increasing fossil energy costs, which provides a new perspective for an in-depth discussion of a carbon tax.

The responsible managers’ primary concern is to increase profit and form a sustainable supply chain. Further, supply chain managers select appropriate combinations when dealing with minimizing waste, quality improvement of biofuel, and multi-mode transportation. The study’s objective is to show the combined effects of improved quality of biofuel and controlling carbon emissions in a smart three-echelon sustainable supply chain management. In this model, one-manufacturer, one-supplier, and multi-retailers are contemplated. When the supplier makes impure biofuel, it transports to the manufacturer for pure biofuel. A random production rate is applied through a smart production system; still, impure biofuel is produced. For that reason, a two-stage inspection policy with a variable manufacturing rate is considered to make the production process flexible such that the quantity of impure biofuel is reduced and impure biofuel treated as a waste. After production, the manufacturer transports pure biofuel to multi-retailers. A variable selling price-dependent demand is introduced for the maximization of profit. The carbon emissions are considered, which are associated with different operational activities of inventory such as preparation of setup of suppliers, manufacturers, transportation of products, and holding stock at manufacturers and the retailer’s end. The retailers keep up the actual order as on demand to the manufacturer to save from the excess holding costs. The model has been solved with a specific algebraic procedure to obtain the global optimum solution. Four numerical experiments are conducted to ensure the model’s effectiveness and profit maximization. The results indicate that these three echelons’ smart production significantly minimized impure biofuel and carbon emissions, positively impacting the environment and the finance, attached to the inventory. The proposed integrated system’s validity is illustrated with sensitivity analysis, numerical examples, and graphical representation.

As a potential solution, nations are looking for sustainable economic growth and investments in clean energy technologies. Therefore, this study aims to empirically investigate the impact of trade, renewable energy, and financial development on environmental degradation among developed and developing countries in light of the EKC (Environment Kuznets Curve) hypothesis. The influence on carbon emissions from 1990 to 2019 is analyzed and contrasted using the Non-linear Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (NARDL) regression technique. Results show that developed and developing countries emit significantly different amounts of carbon. Consequently, evidence of a non-linear and inverted U-shape relationship supports the EKC hypothesis. Further evidence shows a high risk of carbon emissions among both groups of countries with the increase in financial development and trading activities. However, the usage of renewable energy reduces environmental damage, and the association is non-linear. The study recommends using effective measures to minimize environmental damage by using clean energy sources and strengthening the financial system by offering environment-friendly investment loans. Moreover, policies should be designed that promote sustainable growth and investments in environment-friendly technologies.

The 2017-based emissions of PM2.5 and VOCs were 598 and 1079 kt, respectively. Industrial process, fugitive dust and biomass burning were the three major contributors to PM2.5, with a combined contribution of 79%, while industrial process, on-road mobile, solvent utilization and biomass burning were the four major contributors to VOCs emissions, with a combined contribution of 90%. Other unidentified species had the highest emissions, followed by carbonaceous components and inorganic elements and water-soluble ions. The total amount of OFP and SOAFP were 3482 and 81 kt. The species categories of VOCs that contributed large fractions to the emissions were alkanes, aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygenated VOCs, to the OFP were aromatic hydrocarbons, olefins, and oxygenated VOCs, and to the SOAFP were aromatic hydrocarbons and alkanes. Considering OFP and SOAFP together, industrial process, solvent utilization, on-road mobile and biomass burning are the key emission sources to control. The overall spatial distribution showed that PM2.5 and VOCs emissions were relatively low in the southwest and southeast of Henan province, while emissions were high in densely populated, industrial, agricultural and transportation developed areas, and the spatial distribution characteristics of OFP and SOAFP were similar to those of VOCs emissions.

This paper explores the transformation of rural cooking energy in mountainous areas based on field investigation data from six villages in Chongqing. It systematically reveals the transformation process, driving factors and carbon emission changes in household cooking energy consumption in mountainous areas in the past 20 years by using mathematical statistics, multinomial logit models and the emission coefficient method. The results are as follows. (1) There has been a significant transition in the consumption of rural household cooking energy in mountainous areas. There has been a significant change in the proportion of different energy sources, including fuelwood (59.2%–1.9%), coal (16.5%–0%), gas (12.6%–15.5%), natural gas (6.8%–51.5%) and electricity (4.9%–31.1%). (2) The main driving factors of the household cooking energy transition in mountainous areas are income per capita, householder age, and householder education level. (3) The average annual household carbon emissions from rural household cooking energy decreased remarkably. The average annual household carbon emissions decreased from 6.80 t to 2.62 t in fuelwood (5.40–0.91 t), electricity (0.19–1.28 t) and natural gas (0.03–0.25 t) emissions during the study period. The contribution of this study is to investigate how the household cooking energy transition contributes to carbon peaking and carbon neutrality from a micro perspective. At the same time, this paper explores the mechanisms between the cooking energy transition and the ecological dividend of urbanization and proposes future reform initiatives for rural energy in mountainous areas to help achieve the goals of carbon peaking and carbon neutrality.

A micro, farm-based approach is utilised to generate private returns from renewable energy production, and agriculture, adjusted for the cost of GHGs. This considers both the cost to society of increasing GHG emissions and the benefit of reducing emissions. This paper compares income that could be derived from renewable energy production with average agricultural income from the main farm systems in Ireland.

In this study, the life cycle assessment of the carbon emission of space frame structures which is a classical type of large-span structure is conducted. Space frame structures with bolted spherical joints and space frame structures with welded hollow spherical joints are considered. The life cycle of a space frame structure is divided into four phases including component production, construction, maintenance, and demolition. The tiered hybrid method that combines process-based calculation and input-output analysis is adopted to evaluate the carbon emission of space frame structures. Parametrical studies on the height-span ratio and grid number are carried out using the proposed assessment scheme. The carbon emissions of the space frame structures with different types of joints are investigated and compared. It is found that lower material consumption does not always result in lower carbon emission, and thus it is necessary to evaluate the life-cycle carbon emission during lower carbon-oriented design of space frame structures. An equation for approximately and quickly estimating the carbon emission of space frame structures is fitted from the material consumption to carbon emission datum obtained from the parametrical studies.

Currently, research focuses on various methods for CO2 capture or mitigation from stationary industrial emission sources, such as waste-to-energy plants (WTEP), fossil fuel power plants, steel mills, cement plants, or refineries. One of the promising potential methods is the use of microalgae for biological CO2 fixation from flue gas through photosynthesis.

This novel type of bioreactor using oval-shaped tubes, thus avoiding self-shading limitation, was used for experimental pilot-scale flue gas CO2 abatement verification. Flue gas composition was selected according to pollutants (CO, CO2, NO, SO2) on the outlet of the waste-to-energy plants.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135814";"Green maritime: An improved quantum genetic algorithm-based ship speed optimization method considering various emission reduction regulations and strategies ";" Different organizations and countries have proposed a variety of policies and strategies to reduce emissions from the shipping industry. These include the Emission Control Area (ECA) policy, carbon tax policy, Vessel Speed Reduction Incentive Program (VSRIP), and Virtual Arrival (VA) strategy. These policies and strategies create additional costs for ships, forcing the ships to change their speeds or routes. This highlights the need to study approaches that optimize the sailing speeds of ships, by coordinating the implementation of the multiple governing policies and strategies. This paper develops a cost model that considers different emission reduction policies and strategies; this is followed by an analysis of their effect on emissions reduction. In addition, the paper proposes an improved quantum genetic algorithm based on a “fork gene” and elite strategy, which is specifically designed for specific shipping-related policies and strategy. The model is applied to a shipping route on the United States (US) West Coast, with three key findings. First, the improved algorithm significantly reduces the total cost, compared with the original alternative, in the context of emission reduction policies and strategies. Second, a single policy can produce positive results in reducing emissions, and the coordinated implementation of three separate policies (ECA, carbon tax, and VSRIP) may not lead to better results than a single policy. Finally, adding the VA strategy above and beyond the three other emission reduction policies may create more benefits in reducing emissions and operating costs.

However, the issue of convergence of carbon emissions and intensity across countries with different urbanisation and agrarian structures has been under-researched. Unlike previous studies, we examine whether the urbanisation level and the agrarian orientation determine the tendency for countries' relative carbon intensity (REPGDP) and relative per capita carbon emissions (REPC) to converge over time. We employ the display tools of the distribution dynamics approach and a panel of 217 countries from 2000 to 2016. The main findings are as follows. First, with one exception, two to four convergence clubs will emerge across all groups of countries in the long run. Second, most of the clubs occur at values far from (below and above) the global average emissions level. Third, we construct the ‘policy priority list’ consisting of the above-average carbon emitters with a high tendency to diverge further from the global average in the coming years. Accordingly, we identify the least urbanised (most agrarian-oriented) countries with a REPC value of around 2.2 (1.9) to have a 65% (80%) probability of further divergence. Fourth, the results based on the REPC vis-à-vis the REPGDP variable are largely different. The study extends the existing knowledge about the urbanisation, agriculture and carbon emissions nexus and offers policy recommendations.

The cost index metric and associated ECON speeds inputted into the flight management system control the aircraft's flying speed and ultimately the fuel consumed, and emissions produced. This study assesses the use of this operational tool to further green air transport production in U.S. domestic operations. Data from four major airline Boeing 737 NG routes are analyzed to estimate the effect of each carrier's cost index and ECON speeds on fuel consumption and emissions. Then a social cost index, which incorporates environmental costs, is estimated and tested using a Boeing 737 NG simulator across identical routes to determine the changes in fuel consumption and emissions. On average, we find that for every one unit decrease in an airline's cost index they reduce their fuel consumption by 5.37 lbs. per hour. Further, the average impact of implementing a social cost index is estimated to save nearly 22 gallons of jet fuel and reduce CO2 emissions by 453 lbs. per flight hour. These fuel and emissions reductions are estimated to generate a penalty of 1 min and 43 s on average per flight hour. Overall, we find that airlines can substantially reduce fuel consumption and emissions with minimal impact to operations via implementation of a social cost index.

The paper then adopts the neoclassical growth model in the empirical analysis of energy and carbon rebound effects at the macro-economic level. Cobb-Douglas production function is further applied using Solow growth model and energy as a factor of production to approximate technological progress. Results of decomposition of energy supply show that energy intensity and affluence are the drivers with the most significant effect on energy supply while population has less critical effect. Average energy and carbon rebound effects show partial rebounds of 15.64% and 31.41%, respectively.

In this paper, the comprehensive benefits of CCUS project in coal-fired power plants are defined as economic benefits, environmental benefits and energy benefits, and comprehensive evaluation and prediction analysis of CCUS project in coal-fired power plants are made from these three aspects. The goodness-of-fit of the constructed comprehensive evaluation model can reach 0.99, and the ratio of economic, environmental and energy benefits is about 5: 9: 1. Among them, the best scenario of policy influence, economic development and technological progress can promote CCUS project with benefits of 6.51%, 6.56% and 13.07% respectively. Through case analysis, it can be calculated that when the service life of CCUS project reaches 21.7 years, the investment cost can be recovered from the economic benefits. In the prediction model, the goodness of fit of the economic benefit prediction model is up to 0.95, in which the carbon capture cost of CCUS technology, operation and maintenance cost and carbon price fluctuation play a major role. The goodness of fit of the environmental benefit prediction model can reach 0.90, in which the carbon capture capacity of CCUS project and the world environmental situation are the main influencing factors, and the goodness of fit of the energy benefit prediction model can reach up to 0.95, which is mainly affected by the energy consumption level of CCUS project. The research results show that CCUS project of coal-fired power plants at home and abroad has a good development prospect and remarkable comprehensive benefits.

The government launched the Three-year Action Plan for Winning the Blue Sky War in 2018. Cutting down the coal combustions in the residential sector has been highly addressed. To compare the environmental and health impacts, we set two scenarios: implementing the residential coal-switch policy and excluding the policy, through an integrated evaluation framework consisting of the GAINS IV Asia model and the IMED/HEL model. Results show that compared with the 2030 Baseline, emission of NOx, SO2, and PM2.5 in BTH would decline by 49.7 kt (3.8%), 216.2 kt (20.6%), and 199 kt (25.7%), respectively. Meanwhile, it leads to reductions of PM2.5 concentrations by 9.8 μg/m³ (19.9%), 3.1 μg/m³ (6.4%), 5.0 μg/m³ (10.7%) in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, respectively. However, PM2.5 concentration in BTH would still exceed the World Health Organization Interim Target-1 of 35 μg/m3 by 2030. Carrying out the residential coal-switch policy can avoid 0.78 million morbidities (15.2%) and 0.01 million mortalities (5.6%) in BTH by 2030 compared to Baseline. Further, work time loss would decrease by 15.1% in 2030. The value of statistical life (VSL) of 9.58 billion USD (12.4%), 2.23 billion USD (3.8%), and 12.48 billion USD (6.6%) would be saved for Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei by 2030. Regions with heavy pollution have benefited more from the clean residential combustion strategies and Hebei would account for 50.8%–62.3% of the total avoided health benefits in 2030. The benefit-cost ratio in Beijing is much higher than that in other regions. Implementing the residential coal-switch policies poses remarkable co-benefits on human health and the economy.

Reducing air pollution has since long been a policy priority in China. Reducing CO2 emissions has more recently also become a key priority partially manifested through the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015. Although there are often synergies between reducing CO2 emissions and air pollution, it may have implications for the geographical location if one is prioritized over the other, with subsequent effects on local economies and overall policy efficiency. Therefore, we build a top-down optimization model to assess the provincial allocation of steel production, air pollution impact and the cost for meeting the target of peaking CO2 emissions in 2025 and reducing them by 30% in 2030. This short-term reduction target can be regarded as the first steps for China's steel industry to meet the national net zero target and the Pairs agreement. We analyze a scenario to minimize air pollution impact and compare this with a scenario to minimize CO2 mitigation costs. The results show that it is possible to peak CO2 emissions in 2025 and reduce them by 30% in 2030 but the resulting scrap demand requires increased quality scrap collection or imports. The total cost for different scenarios is similar but optimizing on abatement cost leads to lower cumulative CO2 emissions 2021–2030 compared to optimizing on pollution impact. If reducing pollution impact is the main objective, it leads to 22–26% lower pollution impact than when optimizing on abatement costs, and less primary production in densely populated areas. This implies that policy must handle trade-offs between cost optimal mitigation and pollution impact, as well as effects on local economies. Policy must also balance the accelerated introduction of Electric Arc Furnaces while simultaneously reducing overcapacity in primary production.";"2023-01-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622051241";"13";"Emissions"

The results showed a stark disparity between regions and a declined inequality in the last few years. Specifically, the CF per capita in northern provinces (Liaoning, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Shandong and Shaanxi) exceeded the average level in 2017. From 2015 to 2017, the carbon inequality showed a downward trend, with a national CF-Gini coefficient decrease from 0.31 to 0.28. Meanwhile, the gap between CF per capita in urban areas and rural areas was declining, with a growth rate at 18% and 32% from 2015 to 2017, respectively. In addition, CF per capita from various consumption categories indicated that household equipment and daily necessities, residential, transportation and communication were the three most important sources, with a downward trend from 2015 to 2017.

GHGs emissions in reservoirs have been a hot topic of freshwater GHG research for nearly two decades. The factors influencing the emissions of GHGs from reservoirs are intricate. From a hydrological perspective, the fundamental reservoir characteristics, such as water depth, area and perimeter, have an impact on the total GHGs emissions. From a biological perspective, GHGs emissions from the reservoir could be impacted by bacteria, algae, and other microorganisms because of their physiological metabolism. Here, we classified the global reservoirs as continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR), general reactor (GR), and plug flow reactor (PFR) reservoirs by referring to the simulation graphics and dynamics theory of biochemical reactors. In addition, we examined the connection between algal blooms and GHGs emissions in light of algae degradation and hydrodynamic factors like the water flow rate, water residence time (WRT), and thermal structure of the water column. The results indicated that GHGs emissions have a negative relationship with algae in the GR-reservoirs, while the algae could promote GHGs emissions in the PFR-reservoirs or CSTR-reservoirs. The reactor classification method was introduced into the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), and the spatial heterogeneity of algal bloom-GHGs coupling in different tributaries of the TGR was explained, which proved that the reactor classification method is reliable.

Due to the limited data experiments, the direction and externalities of the impact of urbanization and FDI on carbon emissions in the BRI region remain largely unclear, and accounting for urbanization is also isolated. To address this knowledge gap, this study quantified the direct and spillover effects of multi-dimensional urbanization and FDI on carbon emissions using multiple remote sensing data from 2000 to 2018. The study explored the spatial distribution, evolutionary trends, bivariate evolutionary relationships, and influence mechanisms of carbon emissions with multi-dimensional urbanization and FDI by combining temporal trend (Slope), bivariate spatial autocorrelation, spatial Durbin model (SDM), and other methods. The results indicate that from 2000 to 2018, the total BRI carbon emissions added 253 million tons at an average annual growth rate of 3.68%; since 2013, the average annual growth rate has dropped sharply to 1.34%. East and South Asian countries (especially China and India) posted the highest increase in carbon emissions and had faster growth rates in multi-dimensional urbanization and FDI.

Previous studies based on the emission factor method and life cycle assessment are limited in accounting scope completeness, data reliability, or result applicability at multiple scales and benchmarks. The objective of this study was to carry out a multi-scale multi-benchmark GHG accounting of Chinese coal mines to build a shared understanding and facilitate discussion on this topic. We established a complete accounting model to cover upstream indirect, direct, and downstream indirect GHG emissions related to coal mining. A total of 1151 operating coal mines were investigated to model site-level carbon emissions based on mass and energy benchmarks and then aggregated to 99 cities, 19 provinces, and the country for accounting. The results showed an over 14-fold variation in mass-based site-level accounting, with the highest uncertainty of less than 15%. This variability performed almost the same at city-level aggregating, whereas narrowed to over twofold at the provincial level. Energy-based accounting presented an over 17-fold variation at the site-level with a similar uncertainty to mass-based accounting. Such variability was narrowed to over sevenfold and approximately threefold in the city- and province-level aggregations, respectively. The national average mass- and energy-based carbon footprint of coal mining were 0.39 kg CO2-eq/kg and 0.0185 kg CO2-eq/MJ, respectively, in which approximately 36% of the total GHG emissions were omitted if mining methane escape was reported only. These results suggest improving the methane utilization rate and optimizing coal production and consumption patterns, which implicates cleaner production and sustainable development strategies for the coal industry in China.

In this concern, a CHP-based multi-energy microgrid is studied in this paper which involves heating, cooling, and electricity carriers to supply the energy demands.

First, we find that stringent environmental policy is required to realize the emissions reduction goal when there is heavy investment in public infrastructure. Second, we display that in the presence of public infrastructure, the emissions tax is less able to mitigate pollutants than the emissions cap in a productivity shock, and the interaction between environmental policy and public infrastructure can amplify emissions and macroeconomic volatility in a monetary shock. Third, different from the existing literature arguing that optimal environmental policy should be procyclical in business cycles, we show that it could be countercyclical when the government's willingness to provide public infrastructure is small.

A nuanced case study based on 30 cogeneration plants in France ";" Anaerobic digestion (AD) is often regarded as a promising option to substitute fossil fuel by renewable energy from biomass while sequestering carbon in soils through digestate spreading. Many studies have quantified the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of AD plants. However, GHG assessments are often based on system delimitation that is not always comprehensive enough, leading to incomplete GHG budgets. This is especially the case for the baseline to which AD is compared. In this paper, we propose a thorough evaluation of the net GHG emissions of 30 cogeneration plants in France compared to a detailed definition and assessment of their related baseline, the latter being mostly based on direct biomass supply to agricultural soils. GHG emissions were quantified (i) from substrate supply to AD plants until the use of the produced heat and electricity and to the agricultural use of the produced digestate for the AD scenario and (ii) from substrate supply to their application on agricultural soils for the baseline scenario. Our results showed that on average, in the French energy context, AD plants do not provide significant GHG mitigation benefits, partly because fossil fuel substitution is offset by lower carbon storage in soils compared to the baseline. However, we also found large variability among AD plants in difference in net GHG emissions between both scenarios, a third of which are effective from a GHG mitigation perspective. This variability was contributed by (i) the efficiency of soil carbon storage in the baseline; the lower it is, the more AD displays interest for mitigating GHG emissions; and (ii) the efficiency of AD management, especially emission avoidance by digestate covering, leakage control and heat recovery. Additionally, based on a sensitivity analysis, we showed that direct injection would perform better than cogeneration, and that AD would better attenuate net GHG emissions in a European energy context rather than in the highly decarbonised French context.

Although climate change is one of the most glaring problems, it cannot be understood merely by environmental aspects. Many of these challenges are interrelated and have their roots in a set of crystallized structures that are obsolete, namely the economic ones. Contemporary capitalism has been proving its limitations and contribution to less fair, harmonious and sustainable societies. Evidence of this is the policy efforts that many organizations, such as the European Commission, are making to promote environmental transitions, the circular economy, and green innovations. This article argues that the concept of civil economy may be complementary to this green policy agenda for reflecting on current social challenges and emphasize the importance of cultural, environmental, spiritual and economic resources operating together. It pays attention to gift-giving as a form of civil economy, defining a framework inspired by positive sociology. The article uses the case study of “Los Portales”, an intentional sustainable community located in Spain, with around 40 inhabitants and more than 40 years of existence. The study is of ethnographic character and based on in-depth interviews with experts on the economic governance of this community. The results show that the principles of the gift economy were crucial to the success and longevity of the community. They also suggest an agency-centred approach in which individuals should engage activities that promote personal happiness, collective happiness and prosperity.";"2023-01-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622050600";"7";"Emissions"

However, the analysis of emissions of local contaminants coming from the use of such fuels relevant to preserve air quality and related human health issues. Even though the advantages in reducing climate change using renewable fuels appear to be clear, there are still discrepancies on the effect of fuel composition on engine performance, power, and emissions of local pollutants. In the present work, the performance and regulated emissions from a Euro VI-D hybrid bus using conventional fossil diesel fuel and renewable fuel (hydrotreated vegetable oil (HVO)) under urban driving conditions have been studied. The tests were carried out using an on-board modular measurement system that registers emissions, exhaust gas parameters and records data from the engine, as well as environmental conditions. The registered CO2 emissions and calculated mass, volumetric and energy fuel consumptions were lower when using the renewable fuel, despite the lower volumetric heating value compared to fossil diesel fuel, which is partly attributed to the lower EGR rate with renewable fuel that leads to a higher energy efficiency. Additionally, CO and THC emissions coming from the combustion process of renewable fuel are lower than those of the fossil fuel, given the paraffinic structure of renewable fuel that favors a cleaner combustion. During cold operating conditions lower NOx emissions were registered using the renewable fuel in comparison with the fossil diesel fuel, although slightly lower EGR rates were observed. Finally, the average particle number obtained in the tests is higher when using renewable fuel, but differences are not considered as statistically significant. The results obtained regarding performance and emissions suggest that the renewable fuel could be used as partial or total substitute of diesel fuel with a reduction of direct CO2 and gaseous pollutant emissions in most of the conditions. The developed methodology highlights the relevance of analyzing cumulative values, at least for CO2 and particle number concentrations, before analyzing all the results after testing a vehicle under driving conditions, allowing the detection of any anomaly in the measurements of the different parameters. Future work may be addressed for electrified powertrains combined with renewable fuels and ad-hoc optimization of ECU settings for renewable fuels to improve pollutant emissions performance.";"2023-01-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622050466";"7";"Emissions"

The goal of this study is to identify and critically examine the pathways available to Nigeria to meet its decarbonisation goals in the cement sector. Based on a literature review, the study assesses demand drivers and decarbonisation potentials for the sector. It then presents two different quantitative pathways for growth in production of cement by 2050, and three different pathways for decarbonisation of the sector. Using published data and a scenario analysis tool, the study calculates how the sector's emissions might evolve under each of these pathways. The results indicate that, in the most ambitious scenario, emissions from the sector can plateau by the late 2030s, resulting in an overall increase of 21% by 2050 (compared to 2015 levels). Achieving this scenario is necessary in order to put the sector on a path to net zero emissions beyond 2050. The scenario is driven by reductions in both energy-related and process emissions, as well as a small share of carbon capture and storage and demand management. A moderately ambitious scenario that relies mostly on savings on energy-related emissions results in an 84% increase in emissions by 2050. Finally, the Business-as-Usual scenario results in an almost tripling of emissions by 2050. The results indicate a strong potential for policies to drive improvements in energy efficiency and clinker-to-cement ratio.

The French agricultural sector can contribute as a carbon sink through carbon storage in biomass and soil, in addition to reducing GHG emissions. The objective of this study is to quantitatively assess the additional storage potential and cost of a set of eight carbon-storing practices. The impacts of these agricultural practices on soil organic carbon storage and crop production are assessed at a very fine spatial scale, using crop and grassland models. The associated area base, GHG budget, and implementation costs are assessed and aggregated at the region level. The economic model BANCO uses this information to derive the marginal abatement cost curve for France and identify the combination of carbon storing practices that minimizes the total cost of achieving a given national net GHG mitigation target. We find that a substantial amount of carbon, 36.2 to 52.9 MtCO2e yr−1, can be stored in soil and biomass for reasonable carbon prices of 55 and 250 € tCO2e−1, respectively (corresponding to current and 2030 French carbon value for climate action), mainly by developing agroforestry and hedges, generalising cover crops, and introducing or extending temporary grasslands in crop sequences. This finding questions the 3–5 times lower target of 10 MtCO2e.yr−1 retained for the agricultural carbon sink by the French climate neutrality strategy. Overall, this would decrease total French GHG emissions by 9.2–13.8%, respectively (reference year 2019).

Most Distance-to-Target (DtT) weighting approaches consider policy targets, whereas potential is seen in the weighting of environmental impacts on a more scientific basis. This study aims at the comparison of science-based (SB) to policy-based (PoB) DtT weighting approaches as well as the application in a comparative case study for the domestic footprint of the European Union. The developed approaches integrated SB targets from ten environmental impact categories into the DtT weighting method of the Ecological Scarcity Method in an effort to derive SB eco-factors. In addition to SB eco-factors based on existing weighting factors for Europe from the literature, weighting factors for the European Union were developed. The application of the eco-factors in the case study showed that the SB approach led to three times higher absolute weighting results in contrast to PoB results. SB weighting was dominated by the impact category climate change with the strictest weighting factors in all approaches considered and a share of 87–92%. For the remaining impact categories, common PoB weighting factors were generally stricter. PoB results showed a more balanced distribution, with shares of 64% for climate change, 10% for photochemical ozone formation, 7% for acidification, and 7% for terrestrial eutrophication. Science-based targets can not replace conventional PoB weighting approaches but should be integrated into the weighting step to provide a more comprehensive view of the environmental performance of product systems.

However, the power consumption of cryogenic distillation is higher. This study aims to use the azeotropic properties of ethane-CO2 mixtures to achieve CO2 capture by cryogenic distillation for cleaner LNG production. A single mixed refrigerant LNG process integrated with cryogenic distillation (CD-LNG) or chemical absorption (CA-LNG) is proposed. These technologies are comprehensively compared with respect to energy, economy and environment. The results show that when the feed gas contains 1.8–17 mol% CO2, the power consumption of the CA-LNG process is 0.37–0.40 kWh/Nm3 NG with an exergy destruction of 0.20–0.23 kWh/Nm3 NG. The power consumption of the CD-LNG process is 0.41–0.42 kWh/Nm3 NG with an exergy destruction of 0.18–0.22 kWh/Nm3 NG. Due to the much higher heat load for chemical solvent regeneration, the overall exergy efficiency of the CA-LNG process (49.0–53.8%) is lower than that of the CD-LNG process (50.6–56.0%). In addition, the total annualized cost (TAC) in a 20-years lifespan of the CD-LNG and the CA-LNG for a case study with a process scale of 179,800 t/a and a specified feed gas composition (79 mol% CH4, 10 mol% C2H6 and 11 mol% CO2) are 8,441,117 $ and 9,860,792 $ respectively.

Case study: Residential buildings which apply the Eco-Efficiency Matrix in the city of Quito, Ecuador ";" Of the numerous effects of human activity with a direct impact on changes in the environment, one of the main activities is construction, which generates approximately 33% of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere and contributes to an increase in environmental impact. At present, interest in reducing these emissions has led to the development of various tools to quantify, evaluate and control environmental impact. Among the better-known ones, Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is frequently linked to BIM modelling. The cities are responsible for 75% of carbon emissions, for that reason, this paper aims to analyse whether urban concentration of high-rise blocks. Using the GIS tool to geographically visualize the urban system of the study area, the main displacement routes were located according to the types of transport used and the location of two study sites in the Hypercentre of Quito considered as points of origin for these trips. These data were entered in several tables to ascertain the overall impact in the use phase at city level. The impact of the building in the production, construction, de-construction and recycling phases was added at a later stage. The use of the three tools - LCA, BIM and GIS - allowed us to establish that the highest number of impacts occurs in the use phase, given the high consumption of operational energy. Finally, it was concluded that in Quito, a city model concentrated in height, displays less environmental impact compared to uncontrolled urban extension. It is therefore essential to locally implement tools, such as the Eco-Efficiency Matrix, which contribute to the sustainable development of the city.

Finland, as one of the Nordic countries, is a major contributor to the global drive to achieve decarbonization by 2050. In effect, this study seeks to contribute to the strides by querying the extent to which shocks in energy productivity make or mar the sustainability of the Finland environment from 1990:Q1 to 2019:Q4. The other impacts of financial development, economic growth, and trade openness are considered in the model estimated by using the novel hidden panel cointegration and nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag (NARDL) methodology. The results reveal a significant asymmetric equilibrium cointegration relationship among the variables over long-run time horizons; energy productivity utilization enhances the quality of the environment in Finland over the long run while trade openness, financial development, and economic growth contribute to environmental degradation in Finland in the long term. In particular, a 1% positive and negative fluctuation in energy productivity lowers carbon emissions by 1.79442% and 0.84799% in the long term. Whereas 1% change in trade openness, financial development, and economic growth trigger CO2 emissions (CO2E) by 1.15298%, 0.271365%, and 2.93402% in Finland's economies. The results of the frequency domain causality model corroborate the NARDL results. On the basis of these empirical findings, this study suggests that policymakers in Finland should consider the asymmetric behavior among these variables in setting their trade, environmental, growth, and energy policies.

How to curb excess vehicle emissions has become a key pain point of urban air pollution prevention and control. This work tries to explore an effective integrated approach/framework to quantitatively assess the risk factors of excess vehicle emissions (EVE) and their impact on air quality for China's typical megacities. Bayesian Network is employed as the assessment tool by coupling with the Fault Tree method to curb the above problem for the first time. Four megacities (Beijing, Tianjin, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou) in China are selected as case studies, and the risk factors leading to EVE are identified to construct the Bayesian Network model. At the same time, some accurate quantisation algorithms of the occurrence probability of root nodes were proposed for the target megacities from 2014 to 2019. The analysis results show that the variation trend of the probability of EVE has a good positive correlation with the variation trend of air quality in some megacities. From 2014 to 2019, the no-occurrence probability of EVE in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hangzhou increased from 0.4972, 0.4973, and 0.6314 to 0.6491, 0.6846, and 0.7564; the good air quality rate increased from 47.1%, 47.9%, and 59.2%–65.8%, 60%, and 78.6%.

Nevertheless, sustainable biosynthesis of 3-HP is limited by the lack of robust strains and the need for expensive fermentation medium components. Herein, efforts were made to overcome these limitations through metabolic engineering of Escherichia coli and process optimization.

Next, the endogenous glycerol facilitator (GlpF) was overexpressed to enhance glycerol uptake, and the expression level of aldehyde dehydrogenase (YdcW) was optimized for speeding up 3-HP biosynthesis.

The fossil fuels for heat, steam and power provision, as well as the fossil-fired power importation are condsidered to shift to biomass fuel and renewable power in utilities and process units. A waste heat up-graded utilization system is introduced and adopted to improve the efficiency of heat energy, and a green combined heat and power system based on renewable and sustainable resources is established to reconstruct the conventional utility system. Carbon capture by the organic amine solvent absorption process is also integrated into the bi-objective optimization strategy. The CO2 emission reduction methods were applied individually to a petrochemical site in South China with an annual emission of 3.2 million tons CO2 for the sensitivity analysis. The proposed Petro-CERC model was then performed for the optimization of the combined application of the CO2 emission reduction methods. From the perspective of both carbon neutrality and economy, the optimal value at the trade-off point of CO2 emission is 464 thousand tons CO2/year, and the cost of achieving an 85% reduction of CO2 emission is $44.9 million. Further, the CO2 emission reduction strategies in different petrochemical sites are coupled with four different regions on a national scale according to the matching degree of the three standards of technical feasibility, economic development status and geographical appearance.

Furthermore, the significant negative impact on CO2 emissions is more reflected in cities located in eastern China, cities with lower financial pressure, and cities with more universities. Overall, this study fills up the gap in the empirical research on the impact of FGPA, and casts a new light on the significant environmental performance of GIIPs.

With the RAC sector as an example, a demand-emissions-cost model is developed to assess the potential and costs of emission reductions in different regions of China under different scenarios. The model includes three scenarios: a business as usual (BAU) scenario, a Kigali energy efficiency (KAE) scenario with simultaneous energy efficiency improvements following the Kigali amendment, and an accelerated transition energy efficiency (ATE) scenario with accelerated HFCs reduction and energy efficiency improvements.

As a result, embodied emissions are gaining increased attention, not only due to the decrease in the relative share of operational emissions but also due to increased material needs, e.g. the use of additional thermal insulation in buildings. Some of these strategies, such as the decarbonisation of the energy grid, could also help decrease the embodied emissions of building materials. The objective of this paper is to investigate the influence of increased renewable electricity use in building material production. It also examines future trends in the manufacturing processes – such as an intensified use of bioenergy, improvements in energy efficiency and the introduction of carbon capture and storage – on the GHG emissions of buildings. These strategies are analysed in a combined “future materials” scenario on a macro scale within the Tyrol province in Austria. With a focus on new residential constructions, six design variations of two building case studies are assessed using life cycle assessment. They are then projected to 2050 at the provincial level. The results of the future materials scenario point towards a promising embodied GHG reduction, up to 19% in this analysis. Larger mitigation effects would appear in the 2040s and 2050s, meaning future manufacturing technologies can be seen as a long-term investment. Their reduction potential surpasses the potential impact of an increase in wooden constructions. The latter achieved up to 7% reduction in GHG emissions, which would be mostly visible in the early decades rather than in later ones. These reduction percentages remain lower than those which could be attained at the operational energy level, with reductions of up to 72%.

Power-to-gasoline technology can utilize CO2 captured from industrial processes as well as hydrogen to produce synthetic gasoline as a substitute fossil-derived fuel. However, greenhouse gas emission reductions, in this case, cannot be taken for granted. This study analyzes changes in greenhouse gas emissions caused by the integration of a power-to-gasoline plant into an existing operational environment in Lappeenranta, Finland. The operational environment consists of a cement plant, which is the CO2 source, a chlor-alkali plant producing excess hydrogen, and a gasoline plant. Cradle-to-gate greenhouse gas emissions of a system with a power-to-gasoline plant were compared to a baseline system with a conventional oil refinery using life cycle assessment methodology. Two cases of power-to-gasoline plants, one utilizing excess hydrogen and another with an electrolyzer, and four scenarios with different energy sources were compared to analyze the influence of hydrogen and energy sources on the system's greenhouse gas emissions. The results show that depending on energy sources, the use of excess hydrogen leads to a 22–40 kt CO2-eq (44%–77%) emission reduction compared to the baseline (51.5 kt CO2-eq). In the case of hydrogen production by water electrolysis, the use of renewable electricity for the electrolyzer leads to a 27 kt CO2-eq (53%) emission reduction compared to the baseline. The use of renewable heat increases the emissions reduction in this case to 37 kt CO2-eq (72%). In such scenarios, hydrogen production from water electrolysis can be more beneficial for the emissions reduction compared to the excess hydrogen utilization if the by-product oxygen from electrolysis substitutes oxygen obtained from air separation and the need for CO2 transportation is eliminated by building the plant close to the CO2 source.";"2023-01-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622048788";"3";"Emissions"

Countermeasures can mainly be taken through changes in people's behavior or through technical innovations (von Borgstede et al., 2013). This study aims to investigate the connection between attitude toward sustainable behavior in relation to the environment and climate and the intention to change the behavior regarding nature and environmental protection. Using a structural equation model with Lavaan (0.6–9) (Rossel, 2012) and a sample of 14,233 personal face-to-face interviews in Germany, this study analyzes the importance of the new ecological paradigm (NEP) and environmental concerns (EC) as factors influencing attitudes toward sustainable behavior in the context of the theory of planned behavior (TPB). It also measures attitude on intention to change the behavior regarding nature and environmental protection in the four areas of consumption, energy, food, and mobility. Egoistic environmental concerns and pessimistic view (based on NEP) were found to play the greatest impact on attitude toward sustainable behavior. The results show that the egoistic view has the strongest influence on attitudes toward sustainable behavior related to the environment and climate. Accordingly, behavior change can only be effective if the behavior change measures lead to personal consequences. The influence of attitude toward sustainable behavior on intention to change behavior has the largest effect on the areas of consumption and energy.

With the continuous prosperity of domestic tourism in China, tourism in China creates large amounts of embodied carbon emissions between regions according to its immense industrial infrastructure and multi-regional mobility. In the context of global climate change and China's “dual carbon target”, the continuous monitoring and analysis of carbon emissions associated with tourism in China are becoming more pressing. This study applied the emissions embodied in the bilateral trade (EEBT) model and structure decomposition analysis (SDA) to analyze the spatial–temporal pattern and driving mechanism of tourism embodied carbon transfers (CETT) between 30 provinces in China. It has been found that the CETT of 30 provinces in China between 1997 and 2012 increased from 33.652 Mt to 164.345 Mt, three times more than previously directly estimated, more provinces in China have become a “net destination” of CETT. Tourism risks becoming an “accelerator” of regional carbon emissions, because of the trend of carbon emissions growing faster than economic growth. Based on carbon-intensity analysis, the main driving forces of net CETT were explored: low-carbon technology of tourism products and services, tourist origin structure, and tourist market scale. Technology driving force and structure driving force reduced net CETT outflows by 64.98 Mt and 646.30 Mt, respectively, 1997 to 2012, while the scale driving force increased by 714.28 Mt. This study puts forward specific implements on the regulation and control of CETT in China's from tourism route, supply chain, and government regime by combining quantitative and qualitative methods. This study proposed a research framework of “measure-intensity-driver-regulation” for CETT and connected with the forefront of global climate change research, in order to effectively guide the low-carbon transformation and development of tourism with new tools and methods, and provide a reference for low-carbon green development in the post-pandemic era for the world.

As the country with the largest manufacturing scale and carbon dioxide emissions, it is of great practical and theoretical significance to study China's low-carbon manufacturing issues. Based on the ternary analysis perspective of simmelian tie, this paper chooses to identify the influencing factors through the technology-organization-environment research framework, and derives the pathways of low-carbon manufacturing through the fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis method. The research results show that: (1) Under the low-carbon manufacturing goal, stable industrial chain structure and policy-sensitive are the formation reasons for the simmelian tie. (2) From the perspective of simmelian tie, low-carbon manufacturing will be influenced by the driving role of green technological advances, the supporting role of organizational strategies, and the regulatory role of the policy environment.

This paper treats Qatar as a representative country for understanding the effect of future regional warming on the electricity demand and CO2 emissions We first develop a model that relates daily electricity demand with temperature. By combining this model with temperature projections from the CMIP6 database (bias adjusted and statistically downscaled) and population and GDP projections from four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), we can calculate Qatar's demand for electricity until the end of the century. The model identifies an average sensitivity of +4.2%/°C for the electricity demand and projects an increase in electricity demand by 5–35% due to warming alone at the end of this century. The model suggests that under SSP1-2.6, warming-induced CO2 emissions could be offset by carbon intensity improvements. Furthermore, under SSP5-8.5, assuming no carbon intensity improvement, future warming could add 20–35% of CO2 emissions per year by the end of the century, with half of the electricity demand related to more frequent hot days. We further found that the temperature effect on power demand and CO2 emissions is small compared to the effects from socioeconomic factors such as population, GDP, and carbon intensity.

Particulate matter (especially PM2.5) pollution has attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to its serious adverse health impact. However, the spatial disparity and socioeconomic inequality between urban and rural population owing to PM2.5 pollution have rarely been quantified. In this study, PM2.5 exposures to urban and rural population in China during 2010–2019 were estimated respectively using satellite data and the convolutional neural network. The association between socioeconomic indexes and PM2.5 exposure was then examined with the geographic detectors, considering the tremendous disparity in socioeconomic development between rural and urban communities. The regional difference and urban-rural disparity in PM2.5 exposure was finally quantified based on Theil index. The results show PM2.5 exposure and its spatial difference have decreased significantly during the decade, with the concentration decreasing by 26% (from 48 to 35 μg/m3) and the Theil index decreasing from 0.13 to 0.05. The inter-provincial difference dominates the overall spatial variation in 2010, changing to intra-provincial difference in 2019. We also find that China has faced environmental inequality in PM2.5 exposure between urban and rural community in the past decade, manifesting that the urban population suffered from higher PM2.5 levels than the rural population, while the inequality had decreased significantly by 2019. This is consistent with the pattern that PM2.5 exposures increase with socioeconomic development in the early stage, and stabilize or decrease in the late stage. The results suggest that China should abandon the old path of “pollute first and control later” on rural revitalization strategy, otherwise rural population may experience higher exposure than urban population, plunging rural communities into the “environment-health-poverty” trap.

Due to its complexity, experimental research on spectral splitting photovoltaic/thermal devices is relatively limited, mainly focusing on the laboratory scale energy efficiency test or calculation process verification. These studies do not provide intuitionistic guidance for the actual operation of engineering systems. In this paper, a fluid filter-based compound parabolic concentrator solar photovoltaic/thermal system with engineering application dimensions is designed and experimentally studied under actual outdoor environments. Different fluid filters are prepared and used to regulate the spectral splitting characteristics of the proposed system, including the deionized water, silver/water nanofluids and silver-cobalt sulfate/water nanofluids. When the environmental parameters are relatively stable, the method of adjusting the composition of the fluid filter is used to obtain the dynamic operating characteristics of the system. The results show that silver nanoparticles and cobalt sulfate can improve the spectral absorptivity of the deionized water. Compared with the deionized water, when the silver/water nanofluids is used as the fluid filter, the thermal efficiency of the system increases, the electric efficiency and overall exergy efficiency of the system both decrease, and the three efficiencies are 56.0%, 8.5% and 19.6%, while for the silver-cobalt sulfate/water nanofluids, the efficiencies are 58.0% 8.0% and 20.0%. Moreover, the results reveal that for the photovoltaic/thermal system with a low solar concentration ratio, by enhancing the absorptivity of the fluid filter, the fill factor of the photovoltaic module can increase, but the output electric power will decrease. When the silver-cobalt sulfate/water nanofluids is used, the fill factor and maximum output power of the proposed system are 0.633 and 69.2 W.

According to the study, most of the impacts are due to energy consumption in the annealing and screen print paste process used in ETL, perovskite, HTL and cathode layer for both the architectures. Material selection for the perovskite and other layers has a significant environmental impact on both architectures. Compared to low temperature processed architecture, high temperature processed CPSMs have a greater environmental impact. For a five-year lifetime, the global warming potential (GWP) values for high temperature and low temperature processed CPSMs are 0.180 kg CO2-eq and 0.126 kg CO2-eq, respectively, which are marginally higher than those indicated for commercially available silicon solar cells. Thus, a sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the minimum lifetime required to compete with GWP values comparable to commercial PVs. High and low temperature processed CPSM needed 16 and 11 years of lifetime, respectively, to match silicon's 25 years of lifetime. On the other hand, the study finds the human toxicity contribution by mono-silicon is extremely high compared to the two CPSM architectures because of the contribution by electricity (44.01%) and use of heavy metals such as copper (16.83%) and steel (11.52%).";"2023-11-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623032948";"10";"Emissions"

GHG emissions of the WWTP in different working loads were monitored to quantify the influence of critical processes on GHG emissions and shed light on the relations between direct and indirect GHG emissions with the water-energy nexus. The life cycle carbon footprint of the WWTP was assessed to find the most critical impact factor. A conceptual model of direct and indirect GHG emissions was established based on the water-energy nexus and life cycle assessment (LCA). Results showed that direct GHG emissions were highest in medium working load in May. While high indirect GHG emissions were in February, with the highest working load. Methane (CH4) emission rates, from 44.39 ± 42.49 to 4.94 ± 2.29 kg CO2e·d−1, decreased along the treatment processes due to oxidation. Dissolved CH4 in wastewater mainly came from the influent that was 0.08 ± 0.04 kg CH4·d−1. The increase of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and dissolved N2O occurred in the secondary treatment stage and was affected by the C/N ratio. The operation and maintenance phase had the most significant carbon footprint due to 86.4% of indirect GHG emissions from electricity usage through LCA. Electricity usage and glucose dosing were significantly correlated with N2O emissions but had no contribution to CH4 emissions.

It means that societies should have constant access to clean energy and water resources. The focus on nexus planning and operation including renewable energy sources has covered the requirements for the development of sustainable integrated systems to provide secure energy and water while minimizing carbon footprint. However, the uncertainty of renewable energy resources challenges the operation of such integrated nexuses. In this regard, this paper proposes a risk-constrained operation of a sustainable energy-water nexus with the aim to reduce operational costs as well as carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions amount (t CO2). To supply the energy and water demands, a combination of renewable energy sources and desalination systems are considered. The downside risk constraint is proposed to investigate the impacts of risks of uncertainties associated with renewable energy production and electricity consumption as well as water demands. Electrical and water storage infrastructures are involved to increase the flexibility of scheduling and ensure affordability and sustainability. The problem is modeled as a mixed-integer programming problem resulting in optimal decision-making to manage the energy/water resources and storage systems to provide clean and safe energy and water with the minimum CO2 emission. For the emission sector, the carbon capturing and storing (CCS) technology is proposed to capture the CO2 defusing by the energy sector and resolve the carbon-related issues. To restrict carbon production, both CO2 taxes and cap policies are examined and the results showed that the latter has a considerable effect to incentivize the decision-maker to use CCS technology.

Bangladesh, as a top knitwear exporter also plays a part in this degradation. Globally, there is a lack of readily available life cycle inventory (LCI) data that could be utilized to make decisions for minimizing environmental impact from this sector. Our endeavor is an attempt to address this lacuna. The study adopts a life cycle approach to evaluate the environmental impacts as well as the water footprint of the Bangladeshi textile industry with a particular focus on knitwear through rigorous field surveys and expert interviews. The assessment for both environmental impact and water footprint singled out fiber production to be responsible for most environmental externalities. The study also calculated the environmental impact of using alternative fiber such as organic cotton, recycled polyester, and recycled cotton and compared it to the existing practice of knitwear production; results of which indicate that employing alternative fiber was not only less damaging to the environment but also was economically more beneficial. Furthermore, the study analyzes three decades of revenue and emission data to project greenhouse gas (GHG) emission probability of the textile industry till 2030 for both business-as-usual scenario and alternative practices (alternative fiber composition). The projection shows that adopting alternative practices can decrease the GHG emission potential of current practices by 32%–82%. Additionally, the study provides an exhaustive LCI for knitwear production which can be used for further development of sustainable solutions and practices of the global textile industry.

ZM-3 and carbon footprint analysis in constructed wetland ";" As an emerging bioremediation process for sewage treatment, microalgae-based constructed wetlands (CWs) have received attention. However, few studies have explored the specific links between rhizosphere microorganisms and microalgae in depth, and few studies have considered the combined role of these two types of organisms in carbon emissions. In this study, Desmondesmus sp. ZM-3 and coupled CW systems were set up to explore microalgae and nitrogen-related microbial interactions and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission effects. The results indicated that the removal efficiencies of TN and NH4 +-N in the coupled systems were significantly higher (13.07% and 9.31%, respectively) than those of the CWs. The ATP and electron transport system activity (ETSA) of rhizosphere microorganisms and the activities of enzymes involved in the nitrogen removal process were enhanced after dosing with ZM-3. Microbial community succession analysis showed that ZM-3 addition also promoted the growth of denitrifying bacteria, which became key taxa in the CW. Thus, microalgae and denitrifying bacteria could mutually contribute to the nitrogen transformation process. Furthermore, according to life cycle assessment (LCA), the CO2 emission equivalent was decreased by 4.6 CO2 eq./m3 in the coupled systems. Clean energy usage for power generation and a reduction in light duration are improvement strategies that could further minimize GHG emissions.

Changes to cropping patterns, along with an increase in water and energy demand and rising pressure to reduce carbon emissions, are severely challenging the WEC nexus in the Tarim River Basin (TRB). This study establishes the WEC nexus framework in crop production by analyzing spatio-temporal variations in key indicator trends using the footprint and nexus approach. The study also evaluates the coupling coordination development level of the WEC system based on the coupling coordination degree model. The results reveal the following: (1) The TRB is dominated by blue water irrigation resources, which account for 90% of total water consumption (AWC). There was an overall trend of increasing energy inputs per hectare for major crops in the TRB during 1990–2019. In particular, the energy input per hectare in Bayingol increased significantly and reached the highest level in 2016, at 4.39 × 104 MJ ha−1. Meanwhile, carbon footprint (CF) exhibited obvious spatial differences at the basin scale. Kizilsu Kirghiz had the lowest average CF, at 0.79 kg CO2_eq·kg−1.

The coupling coordination degree of Kizilsu Kirghiz had a clear upward trend and was stable at high levels during 2009–2019. (3) Cropping patterns are an important factor affecting the coupling coordination development of the WEC system.

However, the exploration of effective, economical, and green solutions available to combat hypoxia and its impacts on freshwater remains a longstanding challenge. Herein, oxygen-carrying dual-modified sediment-based biochar (O-KN-SBC) was developed as a new approach to sustainably restore hypoxic freshwater and synchronously mitigate methane (CH4) emission. The O-KN-SBC was observed in column incubation experiments to elevate dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration by 6 times and reduce CH4 emission by 18 times compared to the control. Electrochemical analysis confirmed the ability of modified biochar to promote electron transfer and its role as an electron shuttle to mediate biological processes. Microbial analysis suggested that the restored oxygen-enriched ambiance could greatly promote the expression of pmoA gene with an 8-fold increase and the shift of methanotrophs from Type I dominance to Type I and II co-dominance. Last but not least, partial least squares path modeling revealed that in the presence of O-KN-SBC, CH4 fluxes had strong associations with functional genes namely pmoA and mcrA, which mainly depended on the ambient water quality (especially DO, nitrate, and organic carbon). Our study not only develops a promising approach to sustainably address hypoxia and warming related issues in freshwater systems, but also demonstrates the roles of water quality improvement and microbial community reconstruction in the greenhouse gas emission reduction process.

Such a mid-to long-term construction strategy will bring about prominent economic stimulation effects and complicated environmental impacts, whereas the research is far from sufficiency. This study developed a methodology based on the Hybrid Life Cycle Assessment to quantify the impact of the entire supply chains and relevant pollution processes, by disaggregating nine Sponge City construction sub-sectors from the construction sector in Input-Output table and parameterizing a specific environmental matrix focusing on water and air pollutants and CO2 emission. Taken the Sponge City pilot area of Pingxiang City as a case, the evaluation of direct and overall industrial stimulation effects and embodied pollutant discharges, as well as analysis of the implicit connections, were carried out. It is found that the total inputs stimulated by Sponge City construction could reach 4.4 times of the direct input, while pollution involved by the supply chains amounts to 3%∼6% of total emission of the pilot city. The primary industry providing direct input and the service industries as indirect supporters became the main sources of water pollution. Although the inputs from the secondary industry brought about a more remarkable industrial stimulation effect, direct and indirect inputs from non-metallic mineral products, indirect inputs from metal products and the electricity industry led to noteworthy air pollution problems and global warming potential.

Sustainably treating this ammonia-rich sidestream requires systematic analysis on environmental impacts of shortcut nitrogen removal processes. Coupled Aerobic–Anoxic Nitrous Decomposition Operation (CANDO) is a novel biotechnology for sidestream nitrogen removal with energy recovery potential from N2O. Nevertheless, the environmental impacts of CANDO remain unknown after initial scale-up studies. In this study, three sidestream treatment processes, namely, nitritation-denitritation, nitritation-anammox, and CANDO, integrated with mainstream anaerobic-anoxic-oxic (A2O) treatment routes, are assessed by process simulation and life cycle assessment (LCA). The results show that the nitritation-anammox process has the smallest effect on human health, ecosystem quality, and resource availability among the three routes. Furthermore, the global warming potential generated from the CANDO-A2O process is 157 kg CO2 eq per cubic meter of anaerobic digestion liquid treated, which is slightly higher than nitritation-anammox-A2O (132 kg CO2 eq) but remarkably lower than nitritation-denitritation-A2O (248 kg CO2 eq). With low carbon emission and promising alternatives for carbon source, the CANDO-A2O route exhibits great potential in achieving carbon neutrality. This work is the first to quantitatively evaluate the potential environmental impacts of CANDO from a life cycle perspective, providing insights on the adoption and optimization of shortcut nitrogen removal processes in sidestream treatment.

Two-factor experiments, nitrogen practices with urea and CRU while irrigation practices with conventional irrigation (CI) and alternate wetting-drying water-saving irrigation (AWD), were used to clarify the potential impacts in the Jianghan Plain in China. Life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology was used to examine seven environmental impact categories, including non-renewable energy depletion, global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential, eutrophication potential (EP), human toxicity potential, freshwater toxicity potential (FTP) and soil toxicity potential in addition to an economic assessment. The largest contribution allocated to the comprehensive environmental impact indices included the GWP, EP (>26.28%) and FTP (>62.14%), while the other four indices contributed little, and CRU + AWD had the lowest weighting value (0.7981).

Starting from an urban complex ecosystem, the aim of this study was to establish a system for an integrated urban land–energy–water system to achieve the “double carbon” objectives. Under a framework of urban land–energy–water integration, this study assessed the isomorphism of economy, population, water resources, energy, land use, and a carbon emission system and whether Shenzhen can achieve carbon neutralization in 2060 in a scenario of natural evolution. Then, it took carbon neutralization as the constraint, conducting backward reasoning to obtain values for the population, economic, technological development, water resources, energy consumption, and land carbon sequestration capacity of Shenzhen. Our study shows that the following: (1) Controlling water consumption synergistically reduces water-related energy consumption, while reducing energy consumption indirectly reduces water consumption by directly affecting energy-related water consumption, reflecting the transfer and feedback effect of the water–energy coupling relationship. (2) In the carbon neutral scenario, a rise in the forest cover increased 14,000 tons of carbon sinkage and resulted in the additional consumption of 262,700 cubic meters of ecological water.

To analyze GHG emission features of the UDWSs and their interactions with urban economic development, a hybrid approach of correlation analysis and a programming model was incorporated in a life-cycle framework to provide decision-making support for GHG mitigation strategies in the UDWSs. To verify the applicability of the method, Shenzhen city in Guangdong Province was chosen to analyze the potential of the UDWS for mitigating GHG emissions. The GHG emissions from the UDWS in Shenzhen was 747.82 kt CO2 eq in 2020. Compared with 2020, domestic water consumption would increase by 11.35 % and 18.67 % in 2025 and 2030, and wastewater discharge would increase by 12.88 % and 19.73 % in 2025 and 2030, respectively. In the trend of socio-economic development, the amount of water demand and wastewater discharge of urban residents would increase by 11.49 % to 18.75 % and 12.88 % to 19.75 % from 2020 to 2030, respectively. Optimum strategies of technologies for wastewater treatment and energy mix for electricity generation were obtained, with consideration of GHG mitigation goals in the future. As energy consumption contributed more than 25 % of GHG emissions in the USDWs of Shenzhen, the contributions of new energy sources for electricity production (i.e., offshore wind, solar photovoltaic, biomass, and nuclear) would increase by 0.58–1.02 times and 0.68–1.20 times from 2020 to 2025 and 2025 to 2030, respectively.

The current study mainly focuses on the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) effects and equivalence ratio optimization on W20P20 (64% diesel, 16% WCO biodiesel, and 20% PODE) fuel along with exergy analysis in the HCCI mode of operation. The reason for inculcating exergy analysis in this research is to depict that low-temperature combustion provides a better heat transfer rate inside the cylinder. EGR has been varied in terms of 10%, 20%, and 30% in volume proportions along with the inlet fuel-air mixtures since, the fuel was injected through a pilot fuel injector in the inlet manifold. A novel factor in this research is considering both soot-NOx and HC-CO trade-off characteristics in optimizing the equivalence ratio with the influence of EGR over W20P20 fuel. The performance parameters such as BTE and BSEC show a mere decrement of about 6.67% and 29% of maximum with the influence of EGR while better combustion was found in terms of avoiding misfiring at a low equivalence ratio of 0.29–0.35 and knocking at a high equivalence ratio of 0.61–0.71 for W20P20 fuel.

Micro-grids (MGs) have emerged as a viable solution for utilizing these resources effectively. This paper addresses the unit sizing problem for a two MG system using an intelligent method that considers air pollution emissions while catering to electrical and thermal loads. The MG incorporates photovoltaic (PV) panels, wind turbines (WTs), and a storage energy system comprising an electrolyzer, hydrogen tank, and fuel cell (FC) for combined heat and power (CHP) generation. In cases of excess power generation, an electric heater and backup boiler are employed to meet thermal loads. To account for air pollutant emissions, it is considered as a cost constraint in the objective function. Reliability is ensured by incorporating load curtailment costs as a limiting constraint. The MG is simulated in both islanding and grid-connected modes, with a generation planning program considering load growth. The IEEE RTS data is used for a peak 500 kW electrical load, and seasonal climate changes are factored in when deriving the thermal load. The modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) algorithm is employed to find the global optimal solution. This research addresses key motivations, problems, and solutions in the field of renewable energy-based MGs. It introduces hydrogen tanks and batteries as storage systems to enhance system reliability. The integration of complementary energy sources, such as wind and solar, is proposed to improve system reliability and affordability. The use of batteries, solar, wind, and boilers for electrical and thermal load provision is more economically viable than hydrogen storage due to fuel prices. The proposed model significantly reduces pollution, enhances efficiency, decreases MG costs, and reduces dependence on fossil fuels. Integration with the grid reduces boiler usage, minimizes additional wasted power, generates income from power sales, and further reduces costs. Optimal size determination reveals the affordability challenges of wind and solar sources compared to microturbines, necessitating government intervention through subsidies or penalties for polluting resources. The results demonstrate that increasing subsidies expands the use of wind and solar resources, while the growth of fuel prices impacts resource size and necessitates storage use. Fine-tuning the penalty factor reduces pollution, but exceeding the limit reduces the adoption of renewables. Lastly, interest rate increases influence resource installations in different stages of the development plan. The outcomes of this study highlight the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model in addressing the challenges of MG design, operation, and integration of renewable energy sources. The findings contribute to the advancement of sustainable energy systems and provide valuable insights for policymakers and researchers in the field.

This work investigates the deployment of supply side flexibility options in the future European power system by energy system modelling focusing on classic power storage technologies, hydrogen storage, generation by biomass and grid expansion. While investigating different flexibility availability scenarios, for the first time the competition of long-term flexibility options is investigated across a broad decarbonization spectrum. In all scenarios, an increasing need for additional flexibility options is found for moderate decarbonization levels with VRE shares higher than 50%. From there on, the deployment of power storages grows nonlinearly, and eventually features a remarkable leap when approaching a zero-emission system, which is mainly driven by hydrogen storage investments. This also comes along with a leap in the total system costs. When the expansion of biomass capacities is available, biomass partly takes over the function of hydrogen as a long-term flexibility option. When enabling grid expansion, additional transmission capacities lead to a stronger integration of wind generation, while (especially short-term) storage requirements for higher decarbonization levels decrease. Both the additional investments into biomass generation and transmission grid result in up to 4% lower total system costs, yet, without completely displacing any other flexibility option. We conclude that the interaction of multiply flexibility options will lead to a cost minimal power system.

For efficient and load flexible operation, a novel system integrating Allam cycle and cold energy storage system (CES-Allam) has been proposed. The compression train is employed to increase the pressure of CO2-rich working fluid for both Allam and refrigeration subsystems. The ice slurry is used as a cold energy storage carrier, which is further used to assist in liquefying carbon dioxide (CO2) at a lower evaporating pressure, and leads to higher electrical power output during peak load hours. The thermodynamic and economic models of this integrated system have been developed for comprehensive evaluation. The results show that the proposed integrated system is technically feasible for load flexible operation with a wider range of power generation regulation capacity (28.46%–105.97%) than that of the conventional Allam system (40%–100%). The round trip efficiency is 71.09% for the cold energy storage system, which is equivalent to the adiabatic compressed air energy storage system. The payback period is 4.15 years for the cold energy storage subsystem, which indicates that the CES-Allam system is economically feasible and competitive. Moreover, the sensitivity analyses of electricity prices and natural gas shows that the proposed CES-Allam system is more suitable for areas with higher natural gas prices and greater differences in peak and valley electricity prices. The present study is expected to provide a detailed reference and guidance for the use of cold energy storage to improve the load flexibility of the Allam system.

Clean energy will play an important role in this. Concentrated solar power is one of the cleanest ways to harness solar power and convert it into useable energy like electricity. However, due to the intermittent nature of solar power production, concentrated solar power needs to be coupled with energy storage to ensure the ability to produce and release electricity during peak demand periods. Calcium looping for thermochemical energy storage is an emerging technology that uses calcium carbonate, a highly abundant and inexpensive material, to store energy in the form of calcium oxide and carbon dioxide. A sustainability analysis of a solar-driven calcium looping plant for thermochemical energy storage process is performed in this work. Several process alternatives, previously modelled in Aspen Plus®, are assessed using three sustainability analysis tools, GREENSCOPE, SimaPro, and OpenLCA. Nine process alternatives are considered, including the use of sorbent purge, water vapor as fluidization fluid at the calciner, and different operating temperatures in the calciner. All the analysis tools identified the process alternative using total sorbent purge, water vapor as fluidization fluid and a calciner temperature of 800 °C as the best overall performer. This work contributes through a sustainability analysis to the decision-making on which process configuration and conditions should be used, building on a previous technical analysis of a calcium looping for thermochemical energy storage process.";"2023-12-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623037095";"4";"Emissions Other"

Several alternatives to perform this process have been proposed, but they are either not thermally self-sufficient and depend on using external fuel, or the power usage per ton of methanol is insufficiently optimized, or part of the raw materials must be purged and therefore there is a loss of methanol yield. This original study aims to develop a novel thermally self-sufficient process for e-methanol production (at practically 100% yield along with water by-product of 0.37 kgwater/kgproduct) that only uses green electricity. The main innovation of the process is an effective thermally self-sufficient heat-integration scheme that only needs 0.0059 m3 water/kgmethanol combined with using a dividing wall column to recover the unreacted CO2 and obtain high purity methanol. In addition, the pressure reduction in the reaction-separation loop is limited to the pressure drop of the circuit to minimize the overall green electricity use to only 656 kWh per ton methanol, resulting in net CO2 emissions of −1.13 kgCO2/kgMeOH or 0.78 kgCO2/kgMeOH when the plant operates with green or grey hydrogen and electricity, respectively.

The studies on the carbon footprints of different types of wooden doors are few. In this study, the cradle-to-grave carbon footprints of three types of wooden doors produced in China were comparatively analyzed. Models used for calculating the total life-cycle carbon footprint of a wood-based composite door, a solid wood composite door, and a solid wood door were developed. Considering the biogenic carbon storage and its delayed emissions, the wood-based composite door, solid wood composite door, and solid wood door featured carbon footprints of 0.379, 0.257, and −0.277 kg CO2 e per kg product, respectively. The solid wood door exhibited a negative carbon footprint, indicating that its carbon storage was higher than the carbon emission during the life cycle stage. The raw material acquisition (38%–66%) and the transportation stages (23%–38%) of the three types of wooden doors were the main contributors to the total carbon footprints (excluding the biogenic carbon). The product manufacturing stage released relatively small emissions (11%–24%). The waste disposal treatment at the end-of-life phase, the degradation of wood materials in landfills, and their service life displayed significant impacts on the carbon footprints of the three types of wooden doors. Fiberboard, laminated veneer lumber, sawn lumber, finger-jointed lumber, and electricity were identified as the main emission hotspots.

The results indicate that labor mobility significantly promotes the adoption of clean energy by rural households, with income effects and information channel effects serving as the underlying mechanisms. The study also finds that health risks, as an important consideration for household energy use choices, enhance this positive effect. Furthermore, heterogeneity analysis reveals that labor mobility has a greater impact on households with lower levels of education, lack of social security, and those located in central and western regions. Therefore, the government should take measures to increase the income of the rural migrant population and continuously widen the information channels for rural households to promote clean energy use.

Also, they present favourable ignition characteristics and high cetane numbers. In order to determine ignition control strategies, the dominant oxidation pathways must be identified. To this end, autoignition of OME 2 − 4 /air mixtures is studied using the tools of Computational Singular Perturbation algorithm. It is shown that as the length of the atom chain x increases, ignition delays become shorter. This is because, at the very early stages of the process, H-abstraction and fuel break-up reactions realize in a larger number of ways for larger x . The process develops first through a chemical runaway that tends to slow-down autoignition and then through a thermal runaway that tends to speed-up autoignition at a progressively stronger rate. It is shown that the total heat release is independent of x , although the ignition delay becomes shorter with increasing x . The two stable intermediates H 2 O 2 and CH 2 O are shown to shorten ignition delays, when used as additives in the initial mixtures.

However, the global food system is thought to be responsible for around one-fourth of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with grain production being a major contributor to this system. With the increasing need for food, especially cereal grains, it is difficult to reduce GHG emissions from food production on limited land. However, the cereal production - land use - agricultural GHG emissions nexus has been disregarded in earlier studies which needs to be identified for the sustainable food production system. Therefore, this research aims to assess the interactions between agricultural GHG emissions, food production index, and land usage on cereal production in South Asia. This study employs the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Square (FMOLS) model as a baseline model for a panel data set of 1990–2020 and further checks the validity via Dynamic Ordinary Least Square (DOLS) and robust least square procedure to tackle the endogeneity, serial correlation, and outlier issues. Findings confirm that growing the food production index and land usage boosts cereal grain production in South Asia, whereas rising agricultural CO2 emissions lessen output in the long run. In this paper, we also deploy Dumitrescu and Hurlin's (2012) panel causality test to prove a dual causal connection between the food production index, land use, and cereal food production.

Yet, achieving a balance between climate-resilience pathways, high economic productivity, high human development, and energy efficiency appears complex, leading to potential trade-offs. Here, we examine the overarching effect of the diversified energy portfolio, socio-economic drivers, and governance adaptation readiness on Climate change vulnerability across 212 economies. Contrary to the poor conventional panel techniques reported in the existing literature, we employ novel machine learning and dynamic panel estimation techniques that control for chaos, nonlinearity, mutual coupling, and heterogeneity in dynamic systems. The convergent cross-mapping causality technique reveals mutual coupling effects between energy portfolio, governance readiness, socio-economic drivers, and climate change vulnerability. The rapidly increasing population and increasing demand for resources under the business-as-usual society and economic structure that normalizes unsustainable development pathways due to weak governance structures create ineffective climate-resilient policies that lead to unabated emissions with consequences on climate change. The effect of social and governance readiness leads the transformation process to attain sustainable development. Thus, high social and governance readiness spurs climate resilience through climate change adaptation and mitigation to achieve sustainable development. Alternative (renewables) and nuclear energy have displacement effects on fossil fuels, yet, the magnitude of displacement is not large enough to replace future fossil fuel consumption.

All the surfactants reduced CH4 emission by >95% at dosage 8 g kg−1 and particularly sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) treatment was effective at low dosage of only 2.5 g kg−1 with >95% reduction. Oxidants reduced CH4 emission by 30–85% at different dosages, with sodium hypochlorite being most effective. Flocculant treatment did not reduce CH4 emissions significantly. None of the studied treatments reduced ammonia emissions significantly.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is highly regarded as a clean fossil fuel, capable of both cooling and serving as a heat source. This makes it a favored choice for thermodynamic system design. LNG gasification at −162 °C under standard pressure releases substantial cold energy. To avoid its waste, a novel self-supplying thermodynamic system was devised to recover this energy, incorporating a specific cold storage module that combines power generation and heating systems. This approach offers insights into creating polygeneration systems using LNG as the sole energy source. In light of the intricate energy exchanges within the system, based on the energy parameters of each stream, a comprehensive evaluation of its engineering feasibility is conducted through the analysis of energy, exergy, exergoeconomic, and exergoenvironmental parameters. Additionally, key parameters like R1150 mass flow rate, pump 3 outlet pressure, compressor 2 outlet pressure, LNG pump outlet pressure, and R23 liquefaction temperature are examined. Finally, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), particle swarm optimization (PSO) and the multi-objective artificial hummingbird algorithm (MOAHA) rooted in hummingbird foraging behavior, are applied to optimize the proposed system. The results show that the energy utilization efficiency, exergy efficiency, product unit exergoeconomic cost, and product unit exergoenvironmental impact are 72.08%, 45.45%, 98.04 $/GJ, and 1.478 × 10−2 mpt/kJ, respectively. These excellent performance indicators demonstrate that the system is developable in the field of LNG utilization, filling a gap in the joint research of cold storage, power generation and heating for LNG cold energy utilization. Enhancing system performance can be achieved by increasing the mass flow rate of R1150 and the output pressure of compressor 2, reducing the output pressure of pump 3 and the liquefaction temperature of R23. When increasing the output pressure of LNG pump, can only increase exergy efficiency, while the energy utilization efficiency, product unit exergoeconomic cost and product unit exergoenvironmental impact all go down. Compared with the initial condition, after the application of MOAHA optimization, the exergy efficiency increased by 2.8%, the product unit exergoeconomic cost decreased by 3.47 $/GJ and the product unit exergoenvironmental impact decreased by 0.047 × 10−2 mpt/kJ. These results outperform those of NSGA-II and PSO, indicating that MOAHA can lead to superior system performance by overcoming multi-objective conflicts.

In such a scenario, technological change and innovation are pivotal enablers to improve how companies monitor their ESG data for disclosure purposes, and significantly enhance their strategic ESG performance in several ways, such as by reducing emissions and environmental impact. The adoption of digital solutions for ESG performance has drawn the attention of academics and practitioners, leading to a significant increase in scientific production in the past few years. Yet, extant literature appears fragmented and scattered, despite the fast pace at which it is developing. Consequently, the present study conducts a systematic review of 89 distinct contributions ranging from 2017 to 2023, in order to acquire pertinent information regarding the current status of the topic and draw several lines for future research. The review identifies three main thematic areas, namely the use of digital technologies to enhance the transparency and reliability of ESG data tracking and reporting, the peculiarities of strategic ESG performance when it comes to high-tech companies, and the direct effects technological change has on ESG performance. The study provides a critical overview of each of the thematic areas mentioned above, along with a structured research agenda, thus contributing to the theoretical and managerial discussion on ESG performance and technological change.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139524";"A real options-based decision-making model analysis for climate change mitigation strategies on buildings ";" Flexible options are expected to be adopted in climate change mitigation strategies due to the high uncertainty of climate change. Real options analysis (ROA) matches the feature of filling flexibility under climate change but is seldom leveraged in the decision-making of strategy investment at the building scale. This study proposes a ROA-based decision-making framework to bridge this research gap. First, the future energy consumption is simulated, and the expected yearly future energy loss caused by climate change is calculated. Then, individual and sequential investment analyses are made based on ROA and three strategies (i.e., “shading”, “photovoltaic panels”, and “shading + photovoltaic panels”). Finally, a sensitivity analysis for optimal investment time, investment sequence, etc., is performed, and regression analysis is used to prove and extend the sensitivity analysis results. The results show that climate change uncertainty does not alter the optimal individual and sequential investment strategies. However, increasing the discount rate advances the optimal investment time and shows an exponential relationship with the premium. The enhancement of forcing has a “marginal effect” on project return and it advances the optimal investment year for individual investment. Additionally, the forcing positively correlates with the benefit of deferring the option under shared socioeconomic pathways SSP1-2.6 and SSP2-4.5 but it negatively correlates with the benefit of deferring the option under SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5. The unit dry bulb temperature under certain forcing yields a range of benefits from 0.47 × 106 to 0.90 × 106 USD when deferring the option. This proposed decision-making framework guides the development of mitigation strategies and provides more managerial flexibility for investors.

Here, we selected four bays of Shandong Province, one of the areas in China with the severest emissions of PAHs, as the research area, and chose clam Ruditapes philippinarum as the sentinel species, to systematically assess the ecological risk, bioeffects, and health risks of PAHs, identify their sources, and establish a comprehensive assessment framework for marine POPs using weight of evidence (WOE) approach. Taken together, ecological, bioeffect, and health risk assessments for marine POPs were integrated using Sediqualsoft model of WOE in seawater and sediment, and the overall risk level of PAHs in Shandong coastal area was ‘Moderate’. Meanwhile, the primary source of PAH was analyzed based on socio-economic parameters using a WOE framework, which was mainly derived from traffic and coal in seawater and sediment, respectively. Collectively, a comprehensive framework for assessing risk and source of marine POPs was built for the first time, and it may be applicable to other environments and pollutants.

Government competition can affect the flow of factors for industrial agglomeration. Based on the data of 274 cities in China from 2005 to 2020, this paper constructs improved non-radial directional distance function (NDDF) and dynamic spatial durbin model (SDM). The paper further uses a threshold effect model and a mediating effects model to examines the impact and spillover effects of local government competition (LGC), new energy industry clustering and their integration on ecological total factor energy efficiency (ETFEE) from the perspective of the role of knowledge. To solve the problem of endogeneity, this paper uses the presence or absence of highway entrances and exits in cities in 2004 as an instrumental variable. The study found that new energy industry agglomeration and LGC can promote ETFEE in the short term, but it will inhibit ETFEE in the long term. New energy industry agglomeration affects local ETFEE through two types of mediating effects: narrowing knowledge breadth and widening knowledge distance between cities. At the same time, new energy industry agglomeration and LGC has a significant spatial spillover effect on urban ETFEE in the short term. Areas with high urban ETFEE can promote the improvement of ETFEE in neighbouring areas. However, from the perspective of regional differences, it finds that the concentration of new energy industries and LGC have different effects on ETFEE. There is a significant impact in the eastern region, but not in the central and western regions. Finally, the paper gives constructive advice for the adaptation of the knowledge structure and the improvement of energy efficiency through the national and governmental levels.

";" Meat demand is a crucial part of limiting the rise in global temperature below 1.5 °C or, at least, 2 °C and has an important role in maintaining public health. We combined machine learning with comprehensive meat consumption drivers to analyze and project meat demand both in history (1961–2019) and future scenarios (2020–2100). Our results revealed the disproportionate climate impacts of meat consumption in the West. The country group, Western Countries, was the biggest consumer in history, consuming 38% of global meat cumulatively but accounting for only 14% of the world population from 1961 to 2019. Our projections show that global total meat demand will decline in this century under most future scenarios. The East Asia & Pacific region is expected to contribute 56%–125% of global meat demand decline, but the region is used to being deemed the main driver of many current dramatically rising environmental problems. On the contrary, meat demand in Western Countries may be more likely to increase by 15%–71% between 2020 and 2100. However, both the general public and governments in Western Countries seem reluctant to promote lifestyle changing to mitigate climate change. Thus, it is essential to take measures to limit the negative environmental impacts of increasing meat demand. Especially western high-income countries need to take proportional responsibility for international cooperation to reduce meat consumption for climate change mitigation.

One of the environmentally friendly methods of producing hydrogen is through offshore wind energy, which generates no pollutants during the process. While there have been economic analyses conducted on this production process, the subsequent life cycle study of hydrogen transport scenarios is often overlooked. To bridge this gap, this study focuses on conducting a comprehensive life cycle cost analysis of two hydrogen transport scenarios that utilize ammonia as the carrier. The analysis encompasses various aspects, including life cycle cost analysis, net present value, and the calculation of the levelized cost of hydrogen. Comprehensive sensitivity analysis is performed, considering indicators such as boil-off gas leakage rate and annual transportation mass. Furthermore, this study analyzes the operational risk rate and payback period of the two transportation scenarios. The findings reveal that for transportation distances within 100 km, the life cycle construction cost for the pipeline transport scenario amounts to 761 M$, whereas for ship transportation, it is 201 M$. The annual transport mass for the pipeline is estimated to be 12,000 metric tons, while for the ship, it is 8600 metric tons. The levelized cost of hydrogen is calculated to be 14.62 $/kg for pipeline transportation and 15.54 $/kg for ship transportation. Notably, the annual transport mass emerges as a significant factor impacting the levelized cost of hydrogen in both scenarios. Furthermore, by achieving an annual transport mass of 18,000 metric tons, the levelized cost of hydrogen can be reduced to 10.42 $/kg when the transportation distance extends to 450 km. This highlights the importance of considering the annual transport mass to optimize the cost-efficiency of hydrogen transportation.

However, there is a dearth of literature that investigates the impact of environmental regulations on load capacity factor in Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) economies. This study aims to address this gap by examining the role of renewable energy consumption, human capital, and environmental regulations in improving load capacity factor. In doing so, the paper covers 14 APEC economies; applies second generations panel data models (i.e., CUP-FM (continuously updated fully modified) as the base model and CUP-BC (continuously-updated and bias-corrected) for the robustness); and runs data between 1992 and 2018. The empirical findings present that: i) renewable energy consumption and human capital contribute to improving load capacity factor; ii) environmental regulations are not at a level to increase load capacity factor; iii) economic growth and trade openness significantly reduce load capacity factor. Considering empirical outcomes, this study suggests that APEC should tighten environmental regulations to achieve sustainable environment. In addition, this study offers important sustainable environmental policies for APEC within the framework of empirical findings.

Spent coffee grounds (SCG) have the potential for the biofuel production since it is generated a lot due to the increased coffee consumption, and it has a high heating value. In this study, to evaluate the economic and environmental feasibilities of biofuel from SCG, the feasibilities of biofuel production by transesterification and pyrolysis of SCG were estimated and compared via process simulation, techno-economic analysis, and life cycle assessment. Consequently, the production cost and CO2 emissions of transesterification were 3.08 times and 6.92 times larger than pyrolysis because feedstock pretreatment was necessary before the transesterification and pretreatment efficiency were low. Pyrolysis biofuel had a low 32.18 MJ kg−1 higher heating value compared to the 40.10 MJ kg−1 of transesterification biofuel due to the water contents depending on the cooling temperature of products. By varying efficiency and cooling temperature through the sensitivity analysis, costs became 30.76–43.71 $ GJ−1 and 8.82–12.35 $ GJ−1 for transesterification and pyrolysis, respectively. Although efficiency improved, transesterification cost could not overcome pyrolysis because of the additional pretreatment and separation. The CO2 emissions were reduced greatly in the transesterification system while the pyrolysis system gradually increased. Even though the pyrolysis system could emit more CO2 when transesterification efficiency improved, pyrolysis recycling would be proper for the SCG feedstock because of the economic feasibility.

Coming up with an eco-friendly and energy-efficient building design requires a comprehensive yet complicated optimization that involves a large domain of design measures and indicators due to operational-embodied energy and carbon emissions-energy trade-offs. This paper proposes a multi-phase and multi-objective genetic based framework that couples EnergyPlus to the embodied energy and embodied carbon databases to jointly assess and optimize both the operational and embodied energy and carbon emissions. It determines the most optimal building configuration by adjusting design measures, which encompass geometrical parameters like window-to-wall ratio and building orientation and envelope-related variables such as the construction materials in external walls and window glazing type. This framework is applied to an ASHRAE benchmark model of a small office building located in College Station, Texas, which falls in climate zone 2A. ASHRAE standards 90.1 is considered for creating the initial baseline design. The building is optimized in two phases. In the first phase, the building is optimized for operational and embodied energy to understand potential tradeoffs. In the second phase, the building is optimized to reduce operational and embodied energy as well as carbon emissions simultaneously. This two-phase optimization culminated into two different Pareto front solutions. The results of the first stage of the optimization lead to a 9.73% and a 37.29% reduction in the building's total operational and embodied energy, respectively from the initial baseline design. In the second phase, the building's operational Energy, embodied energy, operational carbon emissions and embodied carbon emissions are reduced by 9.51%, 37.44%, 17.43%, and 35.67%, respectively in comparison with the baseline model.

Ammonia cracking presents an effective method for on-line hydrogen production, eliminating the need for hydrogen transportation and storage. This paper aims to study the comprehensive impacts of ammonia cracking ratio (CR) and equivalence ratio (ER) on combustion performance and NO/N2O/NO2 behaviors under lean-burn operation mode. The ammonia/hydrogen mechanism was updated and simplified to enhance the calculation efficiency in 3D simulation. Visualization measurements for flame propagation and NO and 3D simulations were simultaneously performed in a constant volume combustion chamber (CVCC). The results showed that ammonia blending with the cracked gas of H2/N2 for CR can significantly enhance the combustion rate under lean-burn operation at an ER of 0.5. Nevertheless, this enhancement leads to an increase in NOx due to elevated OH and HNO formation, regardless of N2 separation. In the context of varying ER, ranging from 0.5 to 0.3, the study revealed that increasing CR combined by decreasing ER at a certain point can sustain a higher combustion rate while reducing NOx emissions. For instance, CR45ER0.4 yields a much shorter combustion duration and lower NOx compared to pure ammonia at an ER of 1.0. However, a further increase in CR, such as CR80ER0.3, results in higher NOx emissions again. Moreover, complete cracking or separation from the non-cracked ammonia proves favorable for NOx elimination due to the absence of fuel-NO.

The pollution characteristics of Linfen's PAHs, along with their emission sources and health risks, were scarcely discussed. This study conducted a multi-site observation campaign in Linfen during the non-heating and heating periods (2018–2019) using passive air samplers. Sixteen PAHs were analyzed for the gaseous and particulate samples collected at the 15 sites in the urban, rural, and background areas. The PAH concentrations in Linfen's atmosphere were 225.7 ± 81.9 ng m−3 during the heating period and 139.9 ± 47.5 ng m−3 during the non-heating period, annually averaged to 168.1 ± 58.6 ng m−3, which was predominantly contributed by the rural and urban emissions. Combustion was highly responsible for the PAHs, including the burning of coal for industrial production and winter heating, coupled with the utilization of oils by automobile engines. The spatiotemporal variations of PAHs were associated with the discrepancy of emission intensity rather than that of emission type. The BaP equivalent concentrations for the rural and urban areas were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than the various international standards, indicating the considerable carcinogenic risk for the majority of local residents. These findings are informative for better understanding the atmospheric PAH pollution in a typical resource-based Chinese city.

In this study, multiple novel hybrid models are proposed which combine fuzzy time series (FTS) with mode decomposition to achieve stationarity and improve the effectiveness of the forecasting process. More specifically, air pollution data are first processed using the mode decomposition technique, and sample entropy is used to recombine the subseries, then, the information granularity is utilized for fuzzification.

Three inhibitors, including activated carbon (AC), expanded graphite (EG) and hydrotalcite (MA), were used to modified asphalt in this work. The effects of inhibitors on the VOCs emission characteristics of asphalt were investigated at multiple levels of VOCs total concentration, groups distribution and components characteristics. 101 asphalt VOCs components were detected, among which alkane accounted for more than 50% of the total concentration, followed by aldehyde and benzene. AC with the largest specific surface area and pore capacity exhibited the best inhibitory effect on the emission of VOCs with total concentration inhibition rate of 45.58%, followed by MA, while excessive MA would have adverse effect. Over 90% of VOCs components emissions had been suppressed by AC and EG. And inhibitors had the best inhibitory effect on the emission of olefin and aldehyde in VOCs, followed by ketone, but had the worst inhibitory effect on alkane, which was due to the weak interactions between non-polar alkane and polar hydroxyl on the surface of inhibitors. Furthermore, the effects of different inhibitors on the environmental impact and health risk of VOCs from asphalt were also systematically studied. The highest total inhibition rate of OFP and SOAP from asphalt VOCs by AC was only 58.3% and 21.7%, which was ascribed to the limited suppression on OFP and SOAP generated by alkane and benzene. Meanwhile, the non-carcinogenic risk from asphalt VOCs was mainly caused by acrolein with a contribution rate of 80.0%, AC and EG can completely inhibit the emission of acrolein in asphalt VOCs, while MA showed the poor performance. The contribution rate of acetaldehyde to the carcinogenic risk of asphalt VOCs reached 93.7%, while inhibitors had limited inhibitory effects on its emissions. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the correlation mechanism between inhibitors, emission reduction characteristics of asphalt VOCs and environmental-health benefits, which could provide theoretical support for the design of bituminous material with low environmental-health load.

In Chile, food system is the second source of GHGE. Changing Chileans dietary patterns is key to reducing such emissions. There is geographic variability in terms of dietary patterns within the country. Here we investigated the dietary GHGE in five different geographical zones, along with the main contributing food groups and socio-demographic variables. Data for 4676 individuals were obtained from the 2010–2011 National Survey of Food Consumption. The carbon footprint value of each food was obtained from studies using life cycle assessment methodology. Median and percentiles of dietary GHGE were calculated, expressed in kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent per person per day (kgCO2eq/person/d) and compared among zones by Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests. Logistic regression models were fitted to analyzed associations among the variables of interest and quartiles of GHGE. Diet-related GHGE ranged from 3.50 (2.34–5.12) in the North-Central Zone to 4.66 (2.89–6.69) kgCO2eq/person/d in the South zone. Meat accounted for 53–58% of the GHGE in all the zones, followed by dairy products with 12–13%. Higher GHGE were significantly associated with energy intake (kcal/d) in all of the zones, with high socioeconomic level in the North-Central, South and Metropolitan zones, and with urban residence in the South-Central zone.

Therefore, it is crucial to explore the impact of environmental regulation imperatives (carbon tax rate, green energy intensity, and green productivity) on financing priorities (debt financing and equity financing). For this purpose, we use 10 years of data from the non-financial sector of 6 Asian Economies (China, India, Japan, Pakistan, Singapore, and South Korea), by employing a two-step system Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) for analysis purposes. The findings postulate that carbon tax is inversely and significantly associated with equity and debt financing due to over coating of cost. However, green energy intensity has a direct and significant connection with debt and equity financing. It means an increment in green energy sources leads to boost and strengthen the confidence of the stakeholders in investment and lending decisions. Similarly, green productivity directly and significantly affects debt and equity financing. It further means that firms achieving their goals while mitigating environmental impact leads to an improved resource efficiency, cleaning waste and pollution, and apt sustainable operations. In addition, it attracts stakeholder's intentions optimistically while making investing and lending decisions. Moreover, the analysis outputs reveal that this study brings innovation in the firm financing choice while considering environmental impact.

Our study specifically examines the influence of a low-carbon investment strategy on a firm’s product line design, aiming to better align with consumer needs. Considering the impact of low-carbon investments and consumer environmental concern on the product line design has not been adequately examined in previous research. To fill this gap in research, our study proposes a model of a firm that designs the product line while determining the price and quality of each product. Our findings indicate that the single-product strategy is strictly inferior to the product line strategy when considering the low-carbon investment. This implies that the conventional wisdom that either the single-product strategy or the product line strategy could be an equilibrium strategy does not hold. Intuitively, the firm’s low-carbon investment in a specific product segment solely impacts the corresponding segment’s product quality and pricing decisions. While this intuition holds for the low-carbon investment strategy solely targeting high-end products, it does not apply when the low-carbon investment strategy applies solely to low-end products. Furthermore, our results show that the firm adopts the low-carbon investment strategy and traditional (without low-carbon investment) strategy when consumer environmental concern is relatively high and low, respectively. Finally, our results show that any of the four strategies (the traditional strategy and the low-carbon investment strategies for only low-end products, only high-end products, and both segments) could be optimal, depending on certain conditions, in the product line scenario.

In this work, an effective approach was proposed by surface reconstruction using copper foil to facilitate eCO2R to CH4. The copper foil surface reconstruction was achieved via electrochemical etching in dilute phosphoric acid. Comprehensive characterizations suggested that the crystallinity and chemical binding energy states of the copper foil were well preserved after surface reconstruction, but the arrangement of copper atoms on the surface was adjusted. Etching time for 80 s was the most preferable condition, obtaining a uniform valley pattern structure with abundant grain boundaries, reporting the highest CH4 Faraday efficiency of 68.84% which was an order of magnitude higher compared to green foil counterpart. The relevant partial current density, CH4 production rate, and half-cell power conversion energy were measured to be −16.32 mA cm−2, 0.174 μmol s−1 cm−2, and 28.8% respectively from eCO2R at −1.3 V (vs. RHE). The in-situ ATR-IR spectroscopy confirmed that the surface reconstructed copper foil can significantly strengthen the adsorption of the *CO intermediate, facilitating its further hydrogenation to produce CH4 instead of dimerization to give C2 products. This work expanded the method of surface modification for copper foil via electrochemical etching and realized the regulation of geometric morphology on catalyst surface to obtain the desired performance for CO2 electroreduction reaction.

The city with higher industrial activities, traffic congestion, population density, and energy consumption is most likely to produce higher pollution than the other cities. Therefore, this study uses hybrid deep learning models to forecast air pollution based on the concentration of particulate matter with diameter size of less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5) for two air quality monitoring stations in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The proposed models predict the hourly air pollutant concentration based on 4-h historical input based on six air pollutant data, meteorology parameters, and PM2.5 concentration data from the neighboring air quality monitoring stations. Long short-term memory based on metaheuristic algorithms, namely particle swarm optimization and sparrow search algorithm (PSO-LSTM and SSA-LSTM), are first developed and applied to determine the significance input combination to the changes of PM2.5 concentration at respective target stations. Then, the input configuration that gives the best forecasting accuracy was selected for subsequent experiments using enhanced approaches based on ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD-PSO-LSTM and EEMD-SSA-LSTM). Subsequently, this study also analyzed the contributions of the neighboring PM2.5 dataset to the fluctuation of PM2.5 concentration at target stations. It is found that EEMD-SSA-LSTM model of M5 improves other models in Batu Muda and Cheras by 2.65% and 20.00% for RMSE and 9.31% and 25.30% for MAE, respectively. The results indicate that the proposed model yields the highest forecasting accuracy compared to the other models, and additional information on neighboring PM2.5 significantly improves the forecasting accuracy at both target stations.

They have traditionally been recognized as the most efficient and secure method of transferring gases. Uncertainties in the parameters may develop in the actual world for a variety of reasons which reduces the efficiency of the gas allocation network (GAN). The amount of available gas cannot be forecasted exactly due to the uncertainty in gas supply and shared usage by other demands.

However, Denmark has recently committed to phasing out fossil fuel production by 2050 to meet the climate goals of the Paris Agreement. The decommissioning of the offshore infrastructure is going to be very expensive. Therefore, considering effective ways for its repurposing becomes of great interest. In parallel to this scenario, the energy transition towards renewable and sustainable energy supply has been boosting the construction of offshore wind farms (OWF) in the North Sea. In this context, the integration of OWF with offshore oil and gas (O&G) platforms could result in a better alternative to decommissioning. In this work, a novel zero-carbon emission energy system for both power generation and methane production is proposed. By utilizing surplus electricity from OWF, electrolysis can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen, which can be used in the Allam cycle for power generation and methanation according to the Sabatier reaction, respectively. In this novel integrated system, surplus electricity from wind farms, seawater, and CO2 are converted into controllable electricity, methane, and oxygen. The synthesized methane can be partly stored or exported via existing natural gas pipelines. The portion to be stored/exported is defined as the storage ratio in this study. The integrated system has high flexibility since the Allam cycle and methanation unit can be operated separately or simultaneously. To validate the feasibility of the system, preliminary energy and exergy analysis are performed using Engineering Equation Solver (EES) software. 1% (45 ton/day) of the total daily Danish natural gas consumption is assumed as the baseline for the modeling. If all the synthesized methane is burned in the Allam cycle, 51.34 MW of electricity from wind farms can be transformed into 16.4 MW of controllable electricity.

In this study, a fast ensemble empirical mode decomposition (FEEMD) method was used to analyze the fluctuation patterns of carbon market prices and obtain their characteristic components. Then the characteristic components of carbon prices were reconstructed using sample entropy theory (SRSE), and a partial autocorrelation analysis (PACF) technique was used to screen the data points exerting large impacts on carbon market prices. The FEEMD-SRSE-PACF-ILSTM hybrid model constructed. The main innovation points are as follows: The FEEMD is proposed to solves the common modal aliasing problem during carbon price decomposition and improves the efficiency of the carbon price sequence decomposition; the sample entropy theory and partial autocorrelation analysis methods are applied to reconstruct the characteristic components of carbon prices; the LSTM neural network model was optimized by the grey wolf algorithm to enhance its stability and adaptability. The analyzed price changes of large regional carbon markets in China, the European Union, and the United States can be effectively used to predict prices in the carbon market and guide its participants towards low-carbon investment and trading.

This paper presents the energy, technoeconomic, and environmental assessment of a new hybrid renewable energy integrated system with a novel concept of the thermochemical cycle for methanol production. For this purpose, a thermochemical cycle based on CeO2/Ce2O3 oxides is integrated with the methanol synthesis system. It consists of two chemical steps: (1) oxygen carrier reduction step where metal oxide reduction Ce (IV) to Ce (III) (endothermic phase) is performed employing renewable thermal energy and chemical energy originated from ultra-high concentrated photovoltaics and fossil methane respectively and (2) waste gas dissociation step where oxidation of Ce(III) takes place with dissociation of water and carbon dioxide (exothermic phase) and resulting syngas is converted to methanol. Plant design and simulation are performed in ASPEN plus commercial software. MATLAB was employed for the programming of thermal data to perform pinch analysis. The technical feasibility of the second step was investigated comprehensively in terms of temperature, input molar ratio and the potential operating conditions that were identified (T OXI = 900 °C and H 2 O/CO 2 = 3.7) based on methanol production performance. Overall energy efficiency, solar-to-fuel efficiency and thermal efficiency are calculated to be 77.2%, 38% and 44.1% respectively. The findings of the environmental analysis show that carbon utilization of 20.85%, carbon storage of 79.14%, carbon capture of 100% and carbon avoidance of 19.6% are achieved. Economic analysis shows that the net project capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX) are estimated to be $186.49M and $218.67M. It was found that the best-case scenario of natural gas (NG) price is 40$/MWh, where the breakeven point is achieved during the 5th year of the project lifetime.

Institutional inertia in low-carbon district heating experiment";"The energy transitions are in an acceleration phase, where less carbon intensive technologies emerge, but their applicability is uncertain creating a need for real-life experimentation. Cities have become a focal context, where novel constellations of technologies and practices are introduced to reconfigure patterns of production and consumption. One area of urban energy governance gaining increasing attention especially in a Northern context is the low carbon transition in district heating systems that provide the majority of heating in the residential sector and has been primarily built around combustion technologies relying on fossil energy reserves. This article analyses a bidirectional low heat experiment in district heat in Finland by examining what are the dimensions of institutional inertia and how it impacts the reconfiguration of an urban energy system. Institutional inertia emerges from the technical innovation itself, land-use planning practices, the absence of formal regulations and via organisational inertia in the implementation of the experiment. We find that visions about the innovation can become constraints of the experiment, which limit learning and reshaping of innovation, thus preventing radical transformation of the district heating system and watering down the initial target of the experiment. We contribute to the conceptualisation of institutional inertia within the energy transition.";"2023-11-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623030962";"1";"Emissions Other"

Recently cover crops have been recommended as a practice to ameliorate croplands and develop nature-based climate solutions. However, the information as to where is potentially suitable for developing cover crops is lacking. Here, we try to map the potential regions suitable for cover crops and to estimate nitrogen nutrient supply and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation potentials with the hypothesis that all the suitable fallow lands are used for cover crops. First, we generated a smoothed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) series by Savitzky-Golay method from 2019 to 2021. Then, we produced the phenology dates and tracked the regular crop fallow periods in the three years. Next, we extracted the potential regions for cover crops based on the effective accumulated temperature requirements and drainage limit. Finally, we estimated nitrogen supply and GHG mitigation potentials using the previous measurements. Results show that nearly 13.3% (∼26.7 Mha) of current croplands can be planted with cover crops, providing 1.21 ± 0.26 Tg N yr−1 of nitrogen fertilizer. The potential cover crops can mitigate 58.85 ± 9.95 Tg CO2-eq yr−1 of GHG emissions. SOC sequestration is the dominant process in the GHG mitigation with a rate of 48.15 ± 5.34 Tg CO2-eq yr−1, equal to 30.1% ± 3.4% of the current annual total SOC sequestration in Chinese croplands. The study demonstrates an advanced framework in mapping the potential croplands available for cover crops and providing evidence-based planning of extending cover crops across China. The framework can be widely applied to other regions, contributing to building climate smart agriculture and developing nature-based climate solutions.

Studies on street pollution, flow fields, and relationships between external pollution and subway entrances have not been fully explored. This study focused on street canyons that contain subway entrances to determine the effects of different street canyon morphologies and subway entrance locations on the pollutants present in the environment. After verifying the feasibility of the software through a neighborhood experiment that applied the ENVI-met model for pollutant dispersion in the canyon, we analyzed the fine particle distribution and wind environment using variable models for streets with different subway entrance locations. The results showed that (1) inside subway entrances, pollution was more severe on the windward than the leeward side; (2) descending street canyon morphology was the most detrimental to air quality inside subway entrances; (3) street canyons rising along the wind direction were most favorable for air quality at pedestrian height inside the neighborhood; (4) at subway entrances located in the street extension direction, the leeward subway entrances had higher particulate matter concentrations at the center of the building, whereas windward subway entrances exhibited higher concentrations near the edge of the building. This study suggested that indoor exposure to pollutants in the subway is sensitive to the layout of entrances in street canyons with different geometries and provides recommendations to improve the layout of subway entrances based on air quality.

However, as an agricultural system, it is also vulnerable to extreme events associated with climate change, such as droughts. Nevertheless, there is a gap in the literature regarding how these extreme events can influence the carbon footprint of soybean production. To better understand the climate implications of soybean production, this study assessed and compared the carbon footprint in the Paraná State, Brazil, during the 2020|21 super harvest and the 2021|22 rainfall scarcity. The method of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and the cradle-to-gate perspective were applied using the ImpactWorld+ for Continental Latin America v.1.251 method to calculate the climate change impacts. The uncertainties of short and long-term climate impacts were calculated by the Monte Carlo simulation. The results showed that the carbon footprint of the 2021|22 harvest was 267% greater than that of the 2020|21 harvest, while the 2020|21 production was 86% greater than that of 2021|22. The reduction in productivity observed in 2021|22 soybean crop contributed the most to the long-term climate impacts and impacts on ecosystems and human health.

Due to the significant responsibility of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to environmental dilapidation and destruction, they are an essential engine to the green transition. Business activities are central to achieving SDG12. This article focuses on the contribution of European SMEs to carbon neutrality. We explore the influence of SMEs’ investment in micro resource-efficiency actions on adopting macro measures of carbon neutrality and whether investments, financial, administrative, and regulatory requirements influence the implementation of resource efficiency practices. This is the first attempt to explore the interrelationship between micro resource efficiency and macro climate change measures. A quantitative analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis (exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis) and the partial least squares method. Data from 2021 included 17,144 European SMEs and were retrieved from the fifth wave of the Flash Eurobarometer 498. The results reveal that SMEs' implementation of resource-efficient actions at the micro level positively influenced the adoption of macro-level measures for decarbonization. Furthermore, implementing these micro-measures was positively influenced by business investment and negatively affected by external sources of finance and regulatory and administrative requirements.

This phenomenon is particularly affecting the quality of life in larger cities due to population growth and human mobility. Understanding the space-time variability of the heat stress that various locations will face in the future is therefore crucial for us. Taking into account the aforementioned facts, the current study examined the evolution of the Hi heat stress index in four European capitals - Berlin, Madrid, Paris, and Rome - during the months of July, August, and September between 2008, 2012, and 2017. The European Space Agency (ESA) UrbClim climate model was used to collect environmental data. Furthermore, Local Climatic Zones (LCZ) classifications and land use/cover change (LULC) coverages were used to improve the evaluation and extrapolation of the results. According to the findings, the studied areas experienced significant increases in environmental temperatures and the heat stress index Hi between 2008 and 2017. The four cities' average increase is 0.31 °C per decade, with the southern cities experiencing greater intensity and the northern cities experiencing less intensity. When comparing the spatiotemporal variability of heat stress in different zones, the study discovered that areas with more impervious areas and fewer green areas are more vulnerable to potential increases in heat stress. As a result, future urban developments with more green areas can be able to create spaces that are more resistant to heat stress, improving people's quality of life.";"2023-11-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623030500";"12";"Emissions Other"

In order to accomplish the objective of studying the interaction of carbon and fossil energy markets at different quartiles, we use the method of Granger causality at quartiles, which allows us to assess median and tail causality and to gain insights into how carbon and traditional fossil energy markets interact under different market conditions. This paper analyzes the causal relationships between carbon prices and coal, oil, and gas from June 1, 2015 to October 31, 2022 across all quantiles.

They not only have an obvious impact on slowing down the accumulation of particulate matter but also have a significant impact on public health and socio-economic development. Therefore, to analyze the effectiveness of emergency measures, one must assess their environmental, health and economic impacts. In this paper, we use exposure-response functions and a city-level computable general equilibrium (CGE) model to do so for China's Jing-Jin-Ji region. We find that the emergency measures implemented in 2019 significantly improve the region's air quality and enhance public health by reducing risk associated with acute bronchitis. Moreover, those emergency measures notably benefit the Jing-Jin-Ji region economically by expanding labor supply, most notably in Beijing and Tianjin. It seems Beijing and Tianjin should compensate industrial cities in Hebei, which enabled the Jing-Jin-Ji region's better air quality but encountered far fewer economic benefits. Handan, Baoding, and Cangzhou are among the cities in Hebei that are expanding employment in manufacturing and service sectors.

From a macro perspective, the manufacturing industry and service industry have a significant impact on haze pollution. From sub-industry perspective, manufacture has a significant impact on haze pollution. The service industries such as accommodation and catering, wholesale and retail, and real estate have a positive impact on haze pollution. We further investigate the sub-manufacture industry and find not all sub-industries increase haze pollution. The one-size-fits-all policy should be modernized into one-industry-one-treatment approach, instead of blindly reducing manufacturing and increasing the service industry.

In this study, a 12-month measurement of VOCs was conducted in a coastal area in East China by a novel passive air sampler (PAS). A total of 28 VOC species, mainly in groups of aromatics and halohydrocarbons were observed. The monthly average concentrations of TVOC were as follows: industrial sites (154.10–727.19 μg m−3) > business sites (65.83–86.96 μg m−3) > residential sites (59.63–60.05 μg m−3) > background site (57.62 μg m−3). Their seasonal variation characteristics were: winter > spring > autumn > summer, which was more apparent at industrial sites due to human activities. Six VOC sources including industrial processes, organic solvents, dyeing, plastic synthesis, traffic emissions, and pesticides identified by the positive matrix factorization model compared favorably with the local emissions at industrial sites. Bromoform, hexachloro-1,3-butadiene, C1–C3 halogenated alkanes and benzene homologs could be the important indicators of industrial VOC emissions. The halohydrocarbons and aromatics were the major contributors to the ozone formation potential (OFP) and secondary organic aerosol potential (SOAP) in industrial areas, respectively. Both of OFP and SOAP have their maximum values in winter due to high VOC concentrations. Health risk assessment indicated that a high probability of non-carcinogenic risk (HI > 1) was in the region at 10 m height and 50m radius, and minor carcinogenic risk (CR > 10−6) was in the region at 70 m height and 1000 m radius. Among all the compounds, 1,2-Dibromo-3-chloropropane was the largest contributor with the individual HI value (17.99) and carcinogenic risk (5.34 × 10−3) at the peak.

The use of renewable energy to replace traditional fossil materials in road engineering can reduce carbon emissions and serve as an environmentally friendly approach. Bioasphalt production and the use of biological rejuvenators in road areas have attracted research attention. Existing studies show that biological rejuvenators can effectively improve the regeneration efficiency of reclaimed asphalt pavement (RAP). Different biological rejuvenators have different mechanisms for RAP recovery, which determine the recovery efficiency of RAP. Based on an analysis and summarization of the application of different types of rejuvenators, we provide a comprehensive review of the current studies on biological rejuvenators applied to roads, including the mechanisms, performance, and challenges associated with rejuvenators from different biological sources. Additionally, we discuss the potential for using microorganisms as asphalt rejuvenators. This review shows that plant-sourced rejuvenators can supplement the missing light components in aging asphalt at the colloidal structural level via diffusion and fusion to restore the original asphalt properties. Animal- and algal-sourced rejuvenators can depolymerize the associations formed by van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds, charge transfer, and π-π interactions among aromatic lamellae in aged asphalt through intermolecular interactions. Microorganisms can crack polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at the molecular level and have potential as asphalt rejuvenators. This review provides a reference for the future application of biological rejuvenators from different sources to road engineering.

With the rapid development of wind power in China, hydrogen can be produced through water electrolysis powered by wind-generated electricity. This process offers the potential to gradually replace the hydrogen production from fossil fuel (grey hydrogen), thus promoting the low-carbon transformation of China's hydrogen energy industry. However, further investigation is required to determine the potential displacement of grey hydrogen through the production of hydrogen from wind power in China in the future. To address this issue, this study first obtained wind speed data for the entire China region from the MERRA-2 database. Subsequently, based on the wind speed data for each specific area, the wind turbine model with the lowest power generation cost was selected from the eight available wind turbine models. On this basis, the mixed integer linear programming method is used to construct the cost analysis model of wind power-hydrogen production (WPHP). Based on the local wind power generation data, calculations are performed to determine the optimal installed capacity of the wind turbine, electrolyzer, and hydrogen storage tank within the WPHP system. Additionally, the optimal scheduling of the WPHP system is determined. These optimizations collectively result in the best WPHP cost. Based on this research, the optimal cost of WPHP for each geographical grid in China can be calculated and compared with the local grey hydrogen cost. The analysis reveals that in some areas of Xinjiang, Gansu, and Guizhou, exhibit low costs of wind power. This suggests that the substitution of grey hydrogen with WPHP can be achieved in these areas. Based on technological progress and changes in carbon trading prices, this paper predicts that WPHP in China could potentially replace 16.35–28.69 million tons of grey hydrogen by 2040. Moreover, by 2060, WPHP in China is projected to replace 76.72–92.01 million tons of grey hydrogen. According to the sensitivity analysis conducted, it has been determined that the efficiency of the electrolyzer and the price of the wind power equipment exert the greatest impact on the cost of hydrogen production.

This fundamental balancing process is a key requirement for a net-zero future. Accordingly, this research analyzes the regime-switching effect of Hydrogen economy as the green transition, sharing economy and economic complexity as the complexity-based, and geopolitical risks and energy prices as the geostrategy policies on the Goal 7 targets. To this end, a Markov-switching panel vector autoregressive method with regime-heteroskedasticity is applied to study advancing the Goal 7 in the world's twenty-five large energy consumers during 2004–2020. Concerning the parameters and statistics of the model, the results refer to the existence of two regimes associated with the Goal 7 corners, called “upward and downward” regimes for EE and “slightly upward and sharply upward” regimes for ES and EVS. It is revealed that the vulnerability of EE and ES targets is considerably reduced when the regime switches to the dominant regime that is “downward” and “slightly upward” regimes respectively, and that of the EVS target remains unaffected. Through the impulse-response analysis, the findings denote that the first hypothesis of the efficiency of the Hydrogen economy in promoting the Goal 7 targets is insignificant. However, the significant short-term and dynamic shock effects of the complexity-based and geostrategy policies on the Hydrogen economy are detected, which will be a feasible alternative assessment in advancing the Goal 7. Further, the complexity-based policies support the Goal 7 targets under different regimes, especially in the short- and medium-term. Hence, the second hypothesis regarding the effectiveness of the complexity-based policies in promoting Goal 7 targets is confirmed. The third hypothesis concerning the complexity of the impact of geostrategy policies on the Goal 7 targets is verified. Particularly, the switching process towards the Goal 7 may not necessarily be restricted by the geopolitical risks. Moreover, EE is supported through energy prices in the short-term under both regimes, while they are non-conductive to promote ES and EVS through time. Accordingly, the decision-makers should acknowledge adopting a regime-switching path forward for ensuring the time-varying balanced growth of the Goal 7 targets as the impact of the suggested policy instruments is asymmetric.";"2023-10-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623027245";"4";"Emissions Other"

The integrated effects of amended composting manure with additives and a 50% substitution of chemical fertilizer nitrogen (N) input by amended manure N input to cropland were proved to halve ammonia (NH3) emissions from an integrate manure-cropland system. However, the accompanied impacts of these measures on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the integrate manure-cropland system have not been well quantified. Here, we examined the effects of improved manure storage and treatment and its usage at field on GHG emissions from a system perspective, based on a two-year experiment in the North China Plain (NCP). Manure storage and treatment included natural storage (NS) and composting with straw, with or without amendment by zeolite (Z) and superphosphate (SP). Manure products were applied as basal fertilizer for both crops. Results showed that CH4 was the dominant GHG source in the natural storage treatment, whereas N2O dominated in the manure composting treatments. Amending manure with straw, Z and SP stimulated 15–48 times N2O emission and decreased CH4 emissions by 82%–91% during storage and treatment. Replacement of 50% synthetic fertilizer N by manure N decreased total system GHG emissions by 25%–34%. Differences between composted manure treatments in total system GHG emissions were relatively small, although comparatively higher in amended manure treatments; however, they promoted greater soil organic carbon sink activity, resulting in no significant difference in net global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas emission intensity (GHGI). Application of amended manure produced high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in the integrated crop–manure system. The NH3 mitigation approach of replacing 50% of synthetic fertilizer N by amended manure N synergistically decreased total GHG emissions, increased system NUE and also increased the net economic benefit by 5%–11% over the 2 years of the experiment.

To deeply understand the public's climate change communication power in China under the “dual carbon” context, this study selected Weibo as the source for obtaining climate change texts and analyzed the spatial-temporal differences of climate change communication power by using a web crawler and a communication power model. Through the comparative analysis of the two periods before and after the “dual carbon” goal was put forward, it is found that: (1) After the “dual carbon” goal was put forward, the public's discussion on climate change was more widely distributed, which formed a concerned circle of climate change in coastal areas, but the extensive discussion on climate change did not mean the enhancement of climate change communication. (2) Celebrities play an important role in the communication of climate change, but users with strong communication power for climate change do not mean that the amount of forwarding must be high. (3) The communication power of climate change is generally in a state of fluctuation, and economically developed areas have stronger communication power. (4) Keywords such as “carbon footprint” and “green technology” are the most powerful in the situation after the “dual carbon” goal was put forward. Based on the comparative analysis, the study grasps the role orientation and division of labor as a whole, which will provide a basis for formulating regional climate change-related policies more pertinently.

Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to examine how renewable energy intensity and renewable energy share improve environmental sustainability, the load capacity factor (LCF) in Germany from 1970 to 2018. To this end, the study uses the autoregressive distributed lag model, with the effects of the Kyoto Protocol included as a dummy variable. The study contributes to the literature by considering and testing for the first time the impact of renewables on the LCF in terms of intensity and share for Germany. The empirical results show that (i) economic growth lowers the LCF faster in the early stages of economic development than in later periods; therefore, the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis is valid in Germany. (ii) A 1% upsurge in renewable energy intensity has no statistically significant effect on the LCF, while a 1% rise in the share of renewables in the total energy mix increases LCF by 0.48%. (iii) A 1% rise in urbanization reduces the LCF by 6.52%. (iv) A 1% augment in human capital enhances the LCF by 3.49%.

This is also helpful for the sustainable management of tea plantations. However, little information is available on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and influential factors in tea plantations. Thereby, SOC density (SOCD) and stock were estimated based on 1723 datasets collected from 322 published studies.

To address this gap, our study analyzes the economy-wide impacts of renewable energy expansion policies in Korea, with a specific focus on financing mechanisms. We employ a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model that considers imperfections in labor markets, heterogeneous households, and various electricity generation technologies. Our analysis examines the effects of various financing options for renewable energy on economic growth, the labor market, and social welfare, both with and without emission regulations. Our results reveal a trade-off between efficiency and equality when it comes to financing renewable energy expansion. Specifically, we find that financing the expansion through a lump-sum tax is the most efficient option, resulting in the smallest reduction in GDP compared to the business-as-usual scenario. However, this option also has the greatest negative impact on income inequality, as it leads to an increase in skill premiums and capital prices, exacerbating income disparities between households. Our findings suggest that renewable energy expansion tends to be regressive, with low-income households bearing a relatively larger burden of the costs associated with the expansion. Policymakers need to consider a range of options for alleviating income inequality and labor market disparity, such as targeted subsidies or transfers, to ensure a fair and efficient transition to a sustainable energy system.

As such, it is critical to ascertain how pricing policies could help reduce their consumption in Scotland. This study analysed secondary data of 3260 households from Kantar Worldpanel, which comprised 18 food categories consumed in Scotland. The primary objective was to simulate the implications of an excise tax imposed on HFSS food purchases on climate health and consumer welfare using uncompensated own- and cross-price elasticities estimated from the Exact Affine Stone Index demand model. Two policy scenarios were considered: taxing all HFSS while the prices of the remaining foods remain unchanged; and taxing HFSS while subsidising fruit and vegetables with the revenue generated. The results from the study indicate that imposing taxes on HFSS would reduce their consumption due to price effects. A 10% tax on HFSS food groups while subsidising fruit and vegetables with the tax revenues simultaneously brought about a 5–9% decline in the consumption of HFFS and an 11% and 7% rise in vegetable and fruit consumption respectively. Weekly per capita greenhouse gas emissions could increase by 2% if fruit and vegetables were subsidised with the tax revenues, while decreasing by 3% when only HFSS food groups were taxed. Taxing HFSS without a subsidy policy in place was more regressive on consumers than when fruit and vegetables were subsidised. In conclusion, imposing a revenue-neutral HFSS tax policy would result in a trade-off between dietary, welfare and environmental goals.

The curing conditions of the binders were determined through viscosity and tensile tests, and their low-temperature properties were evaluated through bend creep stiffness tests. Furthermore, hot-mix porous epoxy asphalt concrete (HPEC) was designed with target void ratios ranging from 16% to 24%. Control groups included warm-mix porous epoxy asphalt concrete (WPEC) and high-viscosity modified porous asphalt concrete (HPAC) with a 20% target void ratio. The road performance of these various porous asphalt concrete was evaluated through multiple tests, including wheel tracking, low-temperature beam bending, dynamic modulus, four-point bending fatigue, freeze-thaw splitting, and Cantabro loss tests. The results indicate that HEAB follows a two-stage curing method of “160 °C, 2 h + 60 °C, 4 d”, while WEAB adopts a one-stage curing method of “120 °C, 5 h”, both of which demonstrate favorable properties. Moreover, HEAB exhibits better low-temperature properties compared to WEAB. The study also found that increasing the void ratio can reduce the high-temperature performance, freeze-thaw resistance, hydrothermal resistance, and dynamic modulus of HPEC. The low-temperature performance of HPEC reaches an inflection point at a target void ratio of 20%. Under the same target void ratio, HPEC exhibits the best high-temperature performance, dynamic modulus, fatigue resistance, freeze-thaw resistance, and hydrothermal resistance, followed by WPEC and HPAC.

Conversely, during the dust period, PM10 levels rose initially between 2015 and 2017 and diminished from 2018 to 2020, with high concentration clusterings primarily observed in 2015–2016 in western arid cities, Jiuquan and Jiayuguan, in 2017–2019 in eastern cities, Wuwei and Lanzhou, and in 2020 in central arid cities, Jinchang and Zhangye. During the non-dust period from 2015 to 2020, the cumulative effects of single driving factors were ranked in the following order: soil moisture content (MOI), geographical location (LOC), precipitation (PRE), SO2, gross domestic product (GDP), wind speed (WS), and digital elevation (DEM) while during the dust period, the emphasized factors were ranked in the following order: MOI, LOC, PRE, WS, SO2, GDP, and DEM. The interaction between MOI and WS on PM10 was most noticeable in this study (non-dust: 0.787, dust: 0.832). Thus, MOI and WS are critical components in controlling PM10 pollution. The outcomes of this study can furnish theoretical foundations for ecological construction in Northwest China, unlock novel insights for ecological measures in other global arid and semi-arid cities.

The catalytic effect of biomass blends are identified by using FTIR, XRF, proximate and ultimate analysis. The performance of a fluidized bed gasifier is assessed in terms of its producer gas composition, LHV, CCE, CGE and gas yield. The blending of biomass resulted in the enhancement of producer gas quality due to the synergetic effect. At ER of 0.2, maximum hydrogen of 8.1% and LHV of 4.3 MJ/m3 is obtained, and at ER of 0.35, maximum CGE and CCE of 54.9 and 91% respectively are obtained for RH + CS blend. XRF analysis shows that mineral oxide improves the composition of producer gas, and FTIR analysis indicates a decrease in functional groups in the ash of blended biomass compared to individual biomass.

However, the quantitative analysis of PAHs in asphalt fumes remains a challenge. Particularly, the influences of matrix compounds in asphalt fumes on PAH quantification have not been evaluated, even though matrix effect may lead to biased results. To address such a research gap, this study (1) examined the matrix effect in analyzing PAHs in asphalt fumes, (2) evaluated the effectiveness of clean-up methods, and (3) assessed the effectiveness of different methods for matrix effect compensation. Asphalt fumes from seven asphalt materials or conditions were collected and analyzed. Four clean-up methods were evaluated for their influences on PAH identification and matrix effect mitigation. Two approaches were experimented for matrix effect compensation. This study found an obvious matrix effect in the quantitative analysis of PAHs in asphalt fumes. None of the clean-up methods can effectively remove the matrix effect, but both the standard addition calibration (SAC) method and the internal standard calibration (ISC) method can compensate such effect. The findings are expected to assist in accurate quantification and evaluation of PAHs in asphalt fumes.

The present study, by identifying the absence in the literature of models based on Value Stream Mapping and integrated with Industry 4.0 technologies that promote better energy efficiency practices in industrial processes, proposes a new Lean Management model called Real-time Energy Flow Mapping. This innovative model, provide capabilities to a visual, digital and sustainable management system of all energy behavior in machines and equipment using fully parameterizable metrics and rules. Also, estimulating stakeholders with the ability to predict and monitor energy costs, as well as identify possible problems due to changes in the behavior of energy consumption in machines, thus helping managers to make decisions faster and more dynamically. As a result, the literature search turned up 17 Value Stream Mapping based models with a focus on energy efficiency, along with 31 metrics grouped on energy, environmental and production processes. After discussions by the Focus Groups, 16 resulting metrics were submitted to expert panel, in which the least relevant were discarded and the 13 most relevant classified using Fuzzy Delphi. An analysis to verify the interrelationships between the metrics is performed using the Fuzzy DEMATEL, being finally applied in the proposed model. A case study of the model was carried out, submitting it operationally at the LabFaber 4.0, empirically validating the study. The Real Time Energy Flow Map fills the gap in the literature on Value Stream Mapping models to improve energy efficiency, monitoring energy consumption through dynamic mapping of the energy flow of production processes, identifying the area with increased potential for energy savings through changes in operating behavior that reduce overall energy consumption and environmental impacts.

However, the level of adoption of CLP by consumers is still relatively low in China, and a low-carbon consumption environment has not yet been fully established. Therefore, understanding the determinants of consumers' willingness to purchase CLP is crucial to guiding them toward low-carbon consumption and achieving carbon emission reduction goals. Given the question, this study utilizes the Partial Least Squares Structural Equations (PLS-SEM) to predict the effects of internal psychological factors (environmental concern, cognition, trust, and attitude toward carbon-labeled products) and external contextual factors (command-and-control policy, economic incentive, and information provision policy) on purchase intention, combining data from 482 respondents' questionnaires. The results show that trust and attitude have a significant effect on purchase intention, while cognition and environmental concern do not. Attitude mediates the relationship between environmental concern, trust, and purchase intention. Furthermore, all three types of policy measures have a positive effect on purchase intention. Additionally, the PLS-MGA results reveal differences in the cognition and purchase intention paths across gender groups.

However, from a long-term viewpoint, inherent uncertainties drive the strategic vision of H2 development, usage and establishment. The future trends created by a variety of exogenous and endogenous elements, including Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal factors (PESTEL) are significantly influenced by these unpredictable volatilities as they come into play. The objective of this study is to recognize, define, and analyze significant PESTEL aspects influencing the dynamics of H2 energy in an unpredictably changing environment. Fuzzy Inference systems (FIS) and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) methodologies were used for the case scenario of Greece to analyze how interrelated criteria from the previous categories interact dynamically and behave in a holistic approach. With the help of diverse quadruple helix stakeholders, a survey and three workshops were conducted to establish a participatory modeling framework with multi-level scenario analysis phases for the Greek use case. Initially, an FCM model was determined as an amalgamation of qualitative and quantitative valued concepts. This model was augmented by four more concepts related to Greek H2 production plants projecting future trends of this industry. We run several scenarios (including best and worst case) to analyze the influence of politics and regional economy to the growth of H2 production industry. The scenario of energy crisis depicts a limited positive trend of the hydrogen production. While the economy grows, and the crisis diminishes results show a stronger turn to the hydrogen production.

As such, the transition to renewable energy in the industrial sector is essential to meet the targets. To this aim, establishing industrial community energy systems (InCES) where industries collectively invest in a shared energy system is an economically and environmentally attractive option. Yet, the emergence and continuity of such collective initiatives among industrial companies has neither received considerable attention in the scientific literature nor in practice. This research, as the first of its kind, aims to investigate institutional design options that allow for such collaboration to take place for the establishment and continuity of an InCES. Given the bottom-up and collaborative nature of such initiatives, we take an agent-based modeling and simulation approach, for the first time in this area, that incorporates the institutional and societal attributes that influence the formation and continuation of an InCES. We take data from an industrial cluster in Arak, one of the most prominent industrial cities in Iran. The results of this study confirm the economic feasibility of an InCES as compared to individual renewable energy investment in the cluster. The results also highlight the importance of flexible membership in increasing the number of investors (i.e., industrial companies) in such initiatives.

An analysis of cooling effect, carbon sequestration, and nurturing cost at the street scale ";" Rapid urbanization has contributed to urban heat islands, which can potentially lead to increased energy consumption and carbon emissions, further worsening global warming. The U-shaped street canyon is one of the leading causes of urban heat islands, which may block air circulation and lead to urban heat accumulation. The canyon heat issues can be usually mitigated by nature-based solutions, such as street trees. It is important to increase the greenery space benefits (e.g., cooling effect of trees) with limited canyon space. However, there is an absence of refined greenery space design strategy in various street canyons. This work explored the quantitative design of greenery space (e.g., tree spacing) in different street canyons with complex morphological characteristics, in order to effectively improve co-benefits of trees and mitigate urban heat islands. Eighteen morphological types were considered, including symmetrical & asymmetrical shallow, ideal, and deep street canyons. Co-benefit considering cost of different tree spacings were analyzed, to maximize the benefits of cooling effect and carbon sequestration at minimal nurturing cost. Compared with street canyons without trees, ideal street canyon with tree spacing of 0.2W (W is canyon width) achieved the maximum temperature reduction of 6 °C. The positive correlation between tree spacing and co-benefits was found. The maximum co-benefits of street canyon trees occurred at tree spacing of less than 0.7W, which was largely increased by about 14% compared with 0.2W.

To investigate the effects of no-tillage (NT) combined with a rye (RY) cover crop on energy efficiency and carbon footprint (CF) in soybean production, a four-year experiment was conducted. Three tillage methods [moldboard plowing (MP), NT, and rotary tillage (RT)] and two cover crop treatments [fallow (FA) and RY] were compared. NT had 39.6% and 34.0% lower energy input compared with MP and RT, respectively, due to reduced fossil fuel consumption. However, NT also showed decreased soybean yield compared with MP and RT. Nonetheless, RY cover crop management mitigated yield reduction in the NT system, with the yield of NT-RY being 20.4% higher than that of NT-FA, although not significantly different. NT-RY exhibited the highest energy use efficiency, with high energy outputs from yield and low energy inputs. Moreover, NT-RY resulted in a 3.5% increase in soil organic carbon stock, offsetting total carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalent emissions, leading to the lowest CF (−1892.99 kg CO2 eq ha−1) and yield-scaled CF (−1.44 kg CO2 eq kg−1) among all treatments.

";" While climate change mitigation agenda and energy governance are the central concerns of climatologists and energy-environmental scientists, the mainstream literature seems silent on whether a decentralized governance structure is desirable for complex economic systems and governmental intervention approaches to realize sustainable environments. To frame this critical research gap, we investigate the contribution of fiscal decentralization in moderating the influence of economic complexity and government intervention on energy and carbon efficiency in the presence of real GDP per capita. We employ a panel method of moments quantile regression (MQR) on data from selected seven fiscally decentralized OECD countries over the 1995–2018 period. The empirical results uncovered that economic complexity causes a drop in energy efficiency (at 1, 5, and 10% significance levels), with a more magnified effect in countries with low environmental sustainability levels. Conversely, our findings exerted that government intervention discourages energy and carbon intensity (at diversified significance levels as per probability scores of 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10), with heterogeneous degrees of impact across diversified model specifications. Regarding direct influence, our outcomes exhibited that expenditure and revenue decentralization aid in energy and carbon efficiency. Concerning moderation effects, expenditure and revenue decentralization successfully rejuvenate the environmental sustainability effects of economic complexity and government intervention (at 1 and 5% significance levels). Finally, our study gauged that the EKC phenomenon exists among the sampled OECD members, indicating that economic growth in the region will be the driving force behind the region's long-term environmental sustainability. Estimation results are robust to the alternative dependent variable, carbon intensity and alternative econometric technique, ordinary least squares with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors.

Evidence from China ";" The failure of the global food system to produce food in a sustainable way needs to change urgently, and a solid push to harmonize low-carbon food production with stable supply security is the right direction in which modern agriculture must evolve, but it is more difficult for large food-producing countries, and finding the right practices or systems to help policymakers or producers address this dilemma is critical. This requires political will, increased financing and top-level design. Digital inclusive finance (DIFI) embodies the financial concept of a community of human destiny, and it is worth examining whether this more inclusive and comprehensive financial service can shoulder the “responsibility” of “ensuring food security and reducing carbon emissions” in agriculture. This paper takes China's grain production system as an example, measures the coordinated development level of food production ensuring supply and reducing carbon emissions, and then analyzes the overall and regional characteristics of it. It is found that the coordinated development trend of China's food production ensuring supply and reducing carbon emissions is relatively stable during 2011–2020, fluctuating slightly above and below 0.9, and the central region has the highest level of coordinated development. The empirical results show that DIFI has led to a 4.3 percentage point increase in the level of coordinated development of food production ensuring supply and reducing carbon emissions during the decade, showing a stronger spatial spillover effect on neighboring regions than the local effect. At the same time, in the research of regional division in China, the impact of DIFI on the level of coordinated development of food production ensuring supply and reducing carbon emissions varies across regions, with typical uneven characteristics, and the promotion effect is more significant in the central and northern regions of China. Overall, this paper provides a simple tool for policy makers or producers to understand the balance between guaranteed output and low-carbon development of agricultural production activities. This paper will provide a methodological basis for assessing and standardizing low-carbon agricultural practices, innovating financial development models and systems, and promoting sustainable agriculture.

Catalytic performance and long-term stability of microreactor was tested by stacking the stainless steel wire-mesh support catalysts to allow parallel and cross-sectional flow to stacking configurations. Conversion rates of CH4 and CO2 were measured and found to be 92% and 95% respectively, and syngas ratio of 0.92 was obtained. Only a small decrease of about 3–4% in conversion rates was observed after 100 h of reaction which could be due to whisker like carbon formation as carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Investigation of spent catalysts revealed that surfaces of support catalysts were not fully covered with CNFs, leaving active sites for reactant gases with little effect on long-term stability. In addition to CNFs, in situ formation of γ-Al2O3 flakes were obtained during long-term DRM reaction from the parent FeAl powder that was used for annealing of stainless steel wire-mesh supports to increase the adhesion of hydrotalcite-derived spinel catalysts.

Catalytic performance and long-term stability of microreactor was tested by stacking the stainless steel wire-mesh support catalysts to allow parallel and cross-sectional flow to stacking configurations. Conversion rates of CH4 and CO2 were measured and found to be 92% and 95% respectively, and syngas ratio of 0.92 was obtained. Only a small decrease of about 3–4% in conversion rates was observed after 100 h of reaction which could be due to whisker like carbon formation as carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Investigation of spent catalysts revealed that surfaces of support catalysts were not fully covered with CNFs, leaving active sites for reactant gases with little effect on long-term stability.

";" The digital economy (DEY) has emerged as a critical tool for promoting sustainable urban development through digital transformation. This study examines the effect of DEY on urban energy efficiency in China, employing data from 279 cities between 2011 and 2019. The estimation results of this study reveal a U-shaped relationship between DEY and urban energy efficiency. Specifically, in its initial development stage, DEY reduces energy efficiency, but as it matures, DEY ultimately leads to an improvement in energy efficiency. Moreover, the dynamic threshold model indicates that the U-shaped effects of DEY on energy efficiency depend on industrial structure upgrading, greening urban areas, and the financial support of governments. The results of the Spatial Durbin model confirm that DEY has a spatial spillover effect on urban energy efficiency, but only when the economic distance between cities is taken into account. Finally, the results of the panel vector autoregression model illustrate a long-term bidirectional causality between DEY and urban energy efficiency. According to these findings, this study suggests several specific recommendations for DEY and sustainable urban development.

To address this gap in LCA, the MarILCA working group was founded. This work contributes to MarILCA's output by providing characterization factors for assessing the impacts of aquatic (marine and freshwater) microplastic emissions through the impact category of physical effects on biota and ultimately the ecosystem quality damage category. First, the existing exposure and effect factor (EEF) for micro- and nanoplastic emissions in aquatic compartments (Lavoie et al., 2021) is updated using additional toxicity data, delivering a generic EEF of 1067.5 PAF m3/kgin compartment. Second, fate factors (FFs) are developed for eleven different polymers (EPS, PS, PA/Nylon, PP, HDPE, LDPE, PET, PVC, PLA, PHA, TRWP), three shapes (sphere/microbead, cylinder/microfiber, microplastic film fragments) and five sizes (1, 10, 100, 1000, 5000 μm). To calculate the FFs, a detailed degradation model and a simplified sedimentation model are proposed. Polymer density and size play a major role in the fate, whereas the influence of the shape is less relevant. Ultimately, the EEF and FFs are combined to deliver midpoint and endpoint characterization factors (CFs). Uncertainty is calculated with Monte Carlo analysis. Default and archetype-based CFs are recommended to LCA practitioners in case the details of emission parameters are not fully known. CFs for 1 μm microplastic size are proposed as interim CFs for nanoplastic emissions. Finally, endpoint CFs are tested in case studies within the UNEP report “Supermarket food packaging and its alternatives: Recommendations from life cycle assessments”, assessing the relative magnitude of potential microplastic impacts compared to complete LCA results. The case studies confirm that the proposed methodology contributes to filling a gap in LCA and can assist environmental decision-making on single-use plastics and their alternatives.";"2023-09-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623023557";"47";"Emissions Other"

This study presents a stochastic approach to assess investments in container ships powered by three types of fuel in the context of carbon pricing: Low sulfur fuel oil (LSFO), liquefied natural gas (LNG), and ammonia. To analyse uncertainty, we model carbon permit and bunker prices stochastically, and presented probabilistic functions of the net present value (NPV) and the energy density adjusted levelised cost of energy (LCOE). The results suggest that with carbon pricing the chance of LNG to be more profitable than LSFO increases, while the ammonia-fuelled ship exhibits the least expected NPV with the widest distribution in all carbon pricing scenarios. Fossil fuels are more advantageous in generating a lower cost of power, both with and without carbon pricing. Consequently, our findings suggest that carbon pricing alone will not be sufficient to facilitate a transition to ammonia. Furthermore, various measures to mitigate the uncertainties associated with ammonia fuel would be required, including the development of infrastructure to ensure a stable fuel supply.

Based on 226 carbon neutrality announcements made between 2017 and 2021, we conducted an event study to estimate the impact of carbon neutrality initiatives on Chinese firms' shareholder value. Under the opportunity-motivation-ability (OMA) framework, we further analyzed the heterogeneous effects of distinctive firm characteristics (social rating and firm size), in which carbon neutrality announcements represented opportunity, social rating represented motivation, and firm size represented ability. We further demonstrated how the announcement characteristics and industry differences affected stock market responses. The results indicate that carbon neutrality initiatives have a significant average abnormal return of 0.99% on the announcement date and a positive long-term impact on shareholder value. This equity return is more pronounced for smaller firms with higher social ratings, and the stock market reacts less positively to firms that announce carbon neutrality initiatives in social responsibility reports. The stock market does not react strongly to manufacturing firms’ carbon neutrality initiatives.

However, it is often challenging to estimate decarbonization potential, especially when dealing with large and diverse urban areas. Therefore, it is necessary to study the carbon footprint in the study area before evaluating decarbonization potential. This study aimed to develop a methodology for estimating the decarbonization potential in a district and applying it to La Carrasca neighborhood in Valencia City, Spain. The concept behind selecting a smaller area encompassing multiple sectors, including residential and services, rather than an entire city was to concentrate on often overlooked details, streamline the information processing, and consider factors that are otherwise unfeasible when a larger area is chosen. The proposed method considers all potential emissions according to scopes 1, 2, and 3 (direct emissions, primary indirect emissions, and other indirect emissions, respectively) and all possible decarbonization measures, including renewables, nature-based solutions, electrification, and improved waste management. The study utilizes several tools to achieve these objectives, including HOMER, QGIS, DATADIS, Google Earth, and Excel. The results of this study showed that the decarbonization potential of La Carrasca neighborhood is 7488 tons of CO2, representing a bit more than 11% of its overall emissions, and the total cost per emission saving during the lifetime of all the analyzed technologies is 200 €/tCO2. However, achieving complete decarbonization of the area would require more aggressive mitigation measures, government incentives, policy changes, new measures, and changes in habits among the population. Overall, the numerical results demonstrate the importance of considering an area's carbon footprint and utilizing a comprehensive methodology to estimate the decarbonization potential for effective greenhouse gas reduction.

This approach not only extends the overall lifetime of catalysts, but also reduces the environmental impact associated with the disposal of spent catalysts. Overall, this study contributes to the development of cleaner production technologies by providing a framework for the precise regeneration of metal-poisoned catalysts.

A comprehensive model was established wherein the sCO2 cycle was coupled with the models of various components. For the sCO2 boiler, the total thermal load was assigned to various heaters, and the pressure drop in each heater was calculated. Owing to the strong penalty effect of the pressure drop, both total flow mode (TFM) and partial flow mode (PFM) were applied to the sCO2 boiler. A fluid network integrating the recuperator units was established for heat recovery in the system. A thermal-hydraulic model was proposed for a single unit and an integration package. Various losses were considered in the prediction of the efficiencies of axial flow turbines and compressors. The thermal efficiency increases, attains a maximum, and then decreases with increase of W net. This parabolic distribution results from the tradeoff between the decreased efficiency owing to pressure drops in the heat exchangers and the increased efficiency of the turbomachinery. The maximum thermal efficiency occurred at W net of 300 MWe and 200 MWe when using the PFM and TFM, respectively. Based on the results, PFM is found to eliminate the penalty effect of pressure drops.

Using this model, we simulated flows and losses of manure organic matter (OM), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) from manure management chains (MMCs) with deep litter, anaerobic lagoon, solid-liquid separation (SLS), anaerobic digestion (AD), and combinations of SLS and AD. The sensitivity of degradation and losses of manure constituents to changes in the configuration and parameters of MMCs was assessed. Results showed the MMCs with deep litter and AD led to higher OM degradation, C losses and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions due to the substantial amounts of straw added to bedding and the digester. A trade-off between GHG and ammonia emissions was identified in the MMCs with deep litter. Application of SLS could reduce GHG emissions by 40% to 60% due to reduced methane and nitrous oxide emissions from separated liquid fraction storage. A stronger reduction of ammonia emission was observed when applying SLS to digested slurry than to raw slurry. Sensitivity analysis showed that the N loss was most sensitive to N transformation in the MMC with deep litter, and was most affected by the loss coefficients of ammonia during liquid manure storage and application in MMCs with SLS and AD. Losses of P and K from MMCs with SLS were influenced by separation efficiencies from SLS and loss coefficients from solid fraction storage. The impact of model input parameters on GHG emissions highly depended on the selected manure management facilities.

Focusing on the relationship between the digitalization of government environmental governance (DGEG) and environmental pollution, this study empirically tested the impact of DGEG on environmental pollution and its spatial spillover effect using the spatial Durbin model based on provincial panel data for China from 2015 to 2019. The threshold effect of this impact was examined using the threshold regression model from the perspective of digital infrastructure as well as digitalization developments in economic and social spheres. We found that DGEG can not only reduce environmental pollution in the local area but also improve the environmental quality of surrounding areas through the spatial spillover effect, showing an obvious “digital pollution reduction dividend”. However, this spillover effect has a spatial spillover boundary, only playing a role in pollution reduction within a certain geographical range. The impact of DGEG on environmental pollution has a single threshold effect based on digital infrastructure. As the digital infrastructure has improved over time, the “digital pollution reduction dividend” of DGEG has continued to strengthen, showing a characteristic of “increasing marginal revenue”. Under the constraints of digitalization development in the economic and social spheres, the impact of DGEG on environmental pollution has developed the characteristics of a single threshold, i.e., the pollution reduction effect of DGEG is not significant or even positive in the initial stage, but its impact gradually becomes prominent once it exceeds a certain threshold value.

The decomposition integration framework is widely applied for carbon price forecasting, but several problems remain. Thus, this paper innovatively proposes an enhanced decomposition integration model for deterministic and probabilistic carbon price forecasting, which combines two-stage feature extraction and intelligent weight optimization. In order to decrease the complexity of the data and fully extract the characteristics, two decomposition approaches are utilized. For reconstruction, fuzzy entropy is applied to balance model complexity and computing efficiency. Next, the combination forecasting model based on two deep learning models is built to circumvent the constraints of the single forecasting model, and the cuckoo search optimization method (CS) is utilized to find the weight of the combination model adaptively. Considering the differences in the contributions of each component, the optimal weighting strategy based on CS is then used to derive the final forecast. Ultimately, considering the probability interval can provide more helpful information, the decomposition integration framework is supplemented with Gaussian process regression relying on the mixed kernel function for interval prediction. In an empirical study of five carbon trading markets, the hybrid model developed in this paper exceeded all baseline models regarding prediction stability, proving that the developed model can make effective forecasting for the carbon trading business.

Evaluating the effects of straw returning combined with controlled-release nitrogen (N) fertilizer on soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration is necessary. We conducted a long-term (2013–2018) insitu field trial with six treatments: straw combined with no N and two N fertilizer types [no N fertilizer (CKS), conventional N fertilizer (BBFS) and controlled-release N fertilizer (CRFS)] and their corresponding no N and two N fertilizer treatments (CK, BBF, and CRF), each in three replicates. Overall, straw returning combined with N fertilizer (BBFS and CRFS) improves carbon storage and crop yield by changing aggregate distribution, with the effect of CRFS being more substantial. We further found CRFS treatment significantly increased SOC storage in small macro-aggregates (0.25–2 mm) by 9.2% and 28.4%, respectively, compared to BBFS and CKS treatments, which is mainly due to CRFS treatment increasing the proportion of small macro-aggregates (0.25–2 mm) by 8.1% and 20.1%, respectively, in contrast with BBFS and CKS treatments. Compared to BBFS and CKS treatments, CRFS treatment increased the fluorescence intensity of hydrophobic compounds in humic acid (HA) by 45.0% and 107.6%, respectively. Similarly, in small macro-aggregates (0.2–2.5 mm), CRFS treatment significantly increased the fluorescence intensity of hydrophobic compounds in HA. Lastly, structural equation modeling showed that straw returning treatments promote aggregate formation and carbon sequestration by increasing the fluorescence intensity of hydrophobic compounds in HA, ultimately increasing crop yield. Therefore, CRFS treatment is theoretically an effective method to promote SOC storage and increase crop yield and is a viable practice for sustainable agriculture.

This study about ambitions to check out the spatial and temporal patterns of carbon storage (CS) on the QTP under future land-use changes and their influencing factors. Based on historical and projected climate and land-use information and the compiled carbon-intensity dataset derived from 839 sampling points, we projected future changes in CS in the region. We projected changes of CS in the QTP in the near-term (2021–2040), mid-term (2041–2060), and long-term (2081–2100) periods, using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) model. We found that the total carbon storage (TCS) from 1980 to 2020 was approximately equal to 247–259 × 108 t, where Csoil had the greatest contribution (about 88% of the TCS), while Cabove, Cbelow and Cdead accounted for approximately 5%, 5% and 2% of the TCS, respectively. Furthermore, the TCS decreased from southeast to northwest, corresponding to decreasing forest coverage and increasing unused land area in the QTP. Compared to the baseline period (1995–2014, 259 × 108 t), the CS in the QTP under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) is expected to increase by 7.3–13.5%, 6.2–14.7% and 5.4–14.3% in the three future periods, respectively. Spatially, the carbon increase will be concentrated in the southeastern and northern parts of the QTP, where the land-use types are mainly forest land and grassland. Increases in precipitation and temperature are predicted to take place for the duration of the QTP in the future, driving land-use changes that are projected to result in increased area of forest land, which would increase CS. The CS in QTP is high, being influenced by land use and climatic factors, and future climate change may enhance the carbon sink capacity of the QTP.

Successful environmental behavior relies heavily on public support. However, the lack of understanding of public awareness towards MPs hinders the creation of specific environmental action plans. This study selected the most popular Chinese social media platform (WeChat), collected six years of online dissemination data (2015–2020), and comprehensively analyzed public attention, attitudes, and opinions regarding MPs. Consecutive online propagation attracted approximately 250.42 × 104 readings from MP posts (WeChat articles). Text mining methods (e.g., content analysis and generalized linear models) showed that MP-related information was widely propagated through diverse social groups, especially traditional media publishers (i.e., newspapers and television), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and developed coastal regions. The public has paid more attention to MP pollution in marine environments and human health-related issues (e.g., food and drinking water). Additionally, knowledge of everyday life-sourced MPs (e.g., microbeads from personal care products) has increased. Increased environmental awareness evokes greater public willingness to reduce plastic usage. To deepen environmental education, more efforts are needed to include more impactive publishers living around important ecological zones (e.g., upstream of larger rivers and Mount Everest), and regions with high consumption of plastic products (e.g., the agricultural areas with excessive use of mulch) to propagate knowledge, and information on risk, source, and pollution control of MPs on social media platforms.

The empirical results show that air quality improvement significantly increases the land unit price, and the MWTP value for clean air is estimated to be USD 32.08–33.13/m2 after controlling for variables related to both parcel characteristics and a series of facilities of general interest. Considering the differences in terms of different land use types and administrative levels of cities, the MWTP for clean air is found to exhibit significant heterogeneity both within and between cities. Specifically, the MWTP value of commercial and residential land is significantly higher than that of industrial land, and the value of ordinary prefecture-level cities is much lower than that of municipalities directly under the central government, cities specifically designated in the state plan and provincial capital cities. In addition, mechanism tests suggest that population mobility is a key channel through which changes in land prices reflect the value of clean air.

With utilizing stage recognition and control strategies, engineering machinery can achieve energy savings, and reduce carbon emissions. The traditional machine learning approach requires a large amount of data to train models. In addition to many cases where the available data is limited, even if the data volume is sufficient, it often means that a large amount of testing is required, which is difficult for users who are not professionals and may cause further waste, it is necessary to develop methods that can achieve high accuracy even with limited data.

Initially, the pressure waveforms are carefully extracted and subjected to a robust filtering process to effectively eliminate noise artifacts. Subsequently, relevant features are extracted from the waveforms, which include important characteristics such as the amplitude and frequency of the pressure waves, then the extracted features are normalized using appropriate techniques. The LIBSVM model is carefully trained using the aforementioned extracted features and label data. Finally, to further enhance the accuracy of the proposed method, an intelligent calibration system is utilized. This system plays a crucial role in ensuring that the results obtained from the machine learning algorithm are effectively calibrated, thereby improving the overall accuracy of the method.

This paper creatively puts forward the view of low-carbon digital economy from the perspective of resource flow, digital flow and energy flow, and studies the synergy effect of low-carbon digital development by constructing the synergy model of low-carbon digital development economic and social development. Based on theoretical research, this paper constructs a synergy model and evaluation index system between low-carbon digital development and economic and social development, and an empirical analysis was conducted based on data related to regional low-carbon digital development and economic and social development in China from 2014 to 2019. The empirical results show that the development of China's low-carbon digital economy is the main driving force for future economic and social development. The effects of low-carbon digital economy on economic and social development varied across regions due to their different regional development patterns. The spatial pattern shows a trend of “high in the east and low in the west”. Further, if the low carbon economy and the digital economy included in the stimulus policies can play a synergistic role, it will be able to play the greatest role in promoting economic and social development.

These policies have become important in promoting low-carbon development and green transformation through enterprise financing. This study employs a difference-in-difference (DID) model to examine how a green credit policy affects the financing choices of highly polluting businesses using the data of A-share listed corporations from 2009 to 2021. The research finds that: (1) The number of bank loans has significantly decreased for highly polluting companies; a green credit policy will also reduce the scale of any non-bank loans. (2) The extent of equity financing and bond financing of highly polluting firms on the capital market decreased due to market constraints and the function of policy signaling. (3) The impact of a green credit policy will spread to upstream and downstream enterprises through trade credit, thus reducing enterprises’ commercial credit scale. (4) The impact of a green credit policy on bank loans is more significant in state-owned enterprises, in regions with a high degree of marketization, and in regions with low intensity environmental regulation. The research results provide targeted policy recommendations for promoting the development of green credit and achieving carbon neutralization.

Policies are moving in the direction of an energy transition. Italian regulations, complying with European directives, are driving toward increasingly thermally insulated buildings. An important objective of this study is to determine whether updates to building energy efficiency regulations from 2005, particularly for the envelope, will result in increased envelope resilience to climate change. The building was analyzed without air conditioning, simulating an extreme case of a long period without gas supply. It has been located in all Italian climate zones and adapted to respect the local requirements imposed by national regulations for each climate zone. The legal requirements investigated are Italian Legislative Decree 192/2005, Italian Ministerial Decree 26/6/2015, and Italian Ministerial Decree 6/8/2020. The forecasting analyses were carried out considering the years 2030, 2050, and 2070 and three Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios (RCP 2.6, 4.5, and 8.5). The analysis of the results focused on trends of heating, cooling and total thermal performance index from the years 2030–2070. For all RCP scenarios, the 2015 and 2020 requirements optimize total envelope performance in terms of total thermal performance index and perform particularly well with the 2020 limits. It is clean that lowering the transmittance of the envelope components leads to an improvement in the total thermal performance index which, however, by maintaining the same trend over the years with the different scenarios, suggests that the resilience of the envelope to climate change is actually little affected by the transmittance value of the component structures.";"2023-07-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623015032";"24";"Emissions Other"

Since transportation is a significant source of these emissions, several European countries have implemented plans to switch to electric cars and decrease emissions by 2050. However, this transition presents many challenges, including issues with redesigning supply chains, scarcity of raw materials, and impacts on employment, technology, mobility behaviour, and infrastructure. The aim of this study is to develop a model based on system dynamics and agent-based approaches to evaluate effects of the electric and net zero economy transitions on the automotive supply chains and relevant stakeholders. The study incorporates principles of circular economy, stakeholder theory, and system thinking approach. The research considers various stakeholders such as automotive manufacturers, suppliers, and workers, and it explores several operations such as production, de-manufacturing, and end-of-life activities for three types of vehicles: fuel, hybrid, and electric. The results of the model show that a transition towards electric vehicles and a net zero economy is only possible through the implementation of circular economy, which can generate new business opportunities, reductions in raw material consumption, and a resulting increase in competitiveness; however, at the same time, this transition can have several implications for job. Indeed, the EV transition will significantly reduce the number of manufacturing jobs available in the automotive industry due to an increase in automation, fewer moving parts, and simpler engines. Therefore, it is fundamental that companies and policy makers use the results of this study to reduce the negative effects on employment and plan specific programs and policies to support the developing of new skills for workers and favour their relocation in the supply chain (i.e., end of life activities).

The government gives financial and power-rate subsidies to clean power while putting great support on its construction. However, there is currently a big gap in the government's subsidy on new energy power generation, which is challenging to meet the demand for renewable energy consumption and sustainable development. In this regard, participating in the market is inevitable for renewable energy development, which is significant for promoting renewable energy power consumption and alleviating the subsidy dilemma. Considering the market-based mechanism, this paper regards the electricity market, the tradable green certificate market, and the carbon emissions allowance trading market as an integrated energy platform system that couples carbon emissions with electricity, linking generators and retailers. We consider two scenarios, including green electricity–green certificate separation and unity, and introduce the intermittency of new energy generation to construct the optimal pricing decision for this platform supply chain. We explore the optimal price of tradable green certificate for renewable power and the equilibrium demand for green power and thermal power in two circumstances. The results show that: (1) there is an equilibrium solution in various conditions. Moreover, the optimal price of green certificate in condition two, namely green electricity–green certificate unity, is higher when the on-grid price of green electricity and thermal one and the substitution effect of these two powers satisfy a certain constraint, which can stimulate generator and retailer to generate and consume green electricity as much as possible. (2) The price of carbon emissions and the responsibility weight of renewable electricity consumption both have a positive influence on the optimal price of green certificate and the share of equilibrium demands for green power, whereas intermittency of new energy generation has a negative impact on them. Adjusting the carbon price and incentive responsibility weights and taking relevant measures to reduce intermittency in different situations help to reduce thermal power demand and promote green power consumption. (3) When the prices of green certificates in diverse circumstances are in a certain interval, the impact intensity of changes in green certificate price on electricity demand will arise. It is conducive to performing the facilitative role of green certificate price on the power market better and stimulates the generation and consumption of new energy power in the carbon-electricity coupling market.

Second, we analyze the response decisions of this supply chain under the given incentive strategies. Based on these decisions, an optimal model of carbon reduction is then designed for the government. Finally, these best incentive strategies (including promotion allowance and carbon reduction) are optimized using a heuristic algorithm. The numerical results reveal that cooperation of profit-driven supply chain members improves not only their profits but also carbon reduction efficiency. Governments should promote the coordination of low-carbon supply chains to realize win-win outcomes. In addition, a reasonably higher carbon reduction level and sale price can both help to weaken the bullwhip effect of the supply chain. Effective information updating improves the carbon reduction efficiency better than a promotion allowance.

Reducing food system emissions is an essential component of climate change mitigation, and a system-wide approach, including production, processing, trade and demand-side transformations, will be needed. Long-term analysis of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of food supply is crucial for informing this transformation, and understanding the processes contributing to existing trends can reveal opportunities for future mitigation strategies. To address these needs we used data on food supply, trade and emission intensity to quantify changes in GHG emissions between 1986 and 2017 resulting from food supply in the United Kingdom (UK). Uniquely, the relative contributions of supply-side and demand-side changes to historical trends in food emissions were assessed, and the gap between current UK food consumption and EAT-Lancet recommended diets was used to estimate the additional GHG emission reductions that could be achieved by shifting to the Planetary Health Diet (PHD). It was estimated that in the UK, per-capita GHG emissions from food fell by 32% (from 4.6 tCO2eq/capita to 3.1 tCO2eq/capita) between 1986 and 2017. Of this 32% reduction, 21% was due to supply-side changes (a fall in emission intensity per unit of production due to increased efficiency of farming practices), 10% was due to demand-side changes (including dietary change and waste reduction), and 2% was due to changing trade patterns. Relative to the PHD, however, the average UK citizen still greatly over-consumes beef, lamb and pork, tubers and starchy vegetables and dairy products, and under-consumes vegetables, nuts, and legumes. It was estimated that by adopting the PHD, UK per capita food emissions could be reduced by a further 42% to 1.8 tCO2eq/capita. These results expose the historic contributions of both supply- and demand-side changes to reductions in GHG emissions from food, and highlight the underutilised potential of dietary change in contributing to mitigation of GHG emissions from food.";"2023-07-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623014312";"9";"Emissions Other"

Calibrated to France, we find that providing subsidies to support the labor cost of green firms is the most effective tool to reduce pollution and support the growth of the green sector. This policy is more effective than a carbon tax alone, and especially for stimulating a positive supply–demand cycle in the green sector. In terms of pollution reduction, capital injection into green firms, green vouchers for consumers, and subsidies to private banks’ lending to green firms are less effective than carbon tax alone. If labor becomes more substitutable between green and brown sectors, the effects of green subsidies are attenuated.

An increase in PM2.5 concentration notably diminishes atmospheric visibility and leads to haze formation. PM1, a type of atmospheric PM with smaller particle size, has a more pronounced effect on visibility and aerosol pH compared to PM2.5. In this study, PM1 and PM2.5 samples were collected in August, November, and December of 2020, as well as in April of 2021 in Zhengzhou. The chemical composition, aerosol pH, and light-extinction coefficients (bext) of PM1 and PM2.5 were analyzed based on the aerosol concentrations in three pollution categories. Throughout the sampling period, the average mass concentrations of PM1 and PM2.5 were 56.2 and 71.9 μg m−3, respectively, with nitrate constituting 24.3% of PM2.5. This highlights the severe submicron-level particulate pollution in Zhengzhou. Differences in the composition of PM1 and PM2.5 led to variations in aerosol water content, but the combined effect on aerosol pH was minimal. PM1 displayed a stronger negative correlation with visibility because SNA (NO3 −, SO4 2−, and NH4 +) was primarily concentrated in PM1. The bext of nitrate consistently increased during the pollution period, reaching 58% during the moderate pollution phase. This result suggests that the extinction contribution of nitrate was the main factor contributing to the decreased visibility in Zhengzhou. Reducing nitrogen oxide emissions can lower PM2.5 concentrations and enhance visibility. Additionally, controlling nitrate production can achieve a secondary reduction in aerosol concentration by decreasing the aerosol water content, which in turn reduces the secondary formation of PM. This study is beneficial for formulating measures to reduce the concentration of PM2.5 and reducing pollution.

It is regarded as an important and effective way of reducing carbon emissions in response to climate change. However, knowledge of the influencing factors of support for the ILBRS is still scattered and lacks systematic analysis. This study is one of the first literatures to explore public support for ILBRS through a large sample of longitudinal data relying on psychological theory. Based on the Responsible Environmental Behavior model, we established a mechanism that consists of three levels of factors affecting public support for the ILBRS. These factors involve individual characteristics, individual perception, and willingness of performing other low-carbon behaviors. The results of a longitudinal panel survey at one-year interval with 2,324 valid responses indicated that connectedness to nature, perception that climate change is happening, willingness to sort waste and to use green energy could significantly and positively predict public support for the ILBRS. Based on the findings of this study, we provide practical suggestions for policy makers to further improve the implementation of the ILBRS by raising public awareness of climate change and integrating it with other relevant environmental policies.

An online national survey was conducted on reuse of construction products among actors from the Norwegian construction industry. The valid responses obtained from 260 participants show ‘emission reduction’ as the most important driver for reuse of construction products by all user groups. Even if regulatory and economic components were listed under drivers in the survey questions, they were considered as barriers rather than drivers by some of the respondents. All user groups, except suppliers of reused products, rated ‘lack of documentation’ as the most important barrier, and ‘good planning’ as the most important success factor. Suppliers of reused products rated ‘high cost’ and ‘good planning’ as the most challenging and the most important success factor for reuse, respectively. The findings also reveal different perceptions and levels of optimism among actors. Most respondents were optimistic about availability of reusable products (within less than 5 y), but least optimistic about finding cheaper reusable products in the near future (assuming it might take 9 to 17 y). Laws and regulations, testing, documentation and certification, and economic subsidies are mentioned as the top three measures to address the current barriers.

One factor stands out: that the wind farm is used not only to produce emission-free hydrogen but that this hydrogen is also sold locally to decarbonize sectors such as transport and industry. In other words, hydrogen on its own will not “save” onshore wind from contestation, but hydrogen with a local purpose will render citizens more supportive of these projects, even when situated in their own municipality. This effect is particularly strong among younger and more educated citizens.

However, current research on the adoption of HFCVs concentrates on perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes toward HFCVs and disregards the significance of intrinsic needs in the adoption process. Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs model presents a fundamental framework that investigates the aspects that play crucial roles in influencing the motivation of individuals to adopt a specific product or service. Based on the same framework, this research empirically analyses the needs that motivate people to adopt HFCVs. Survey responses from 380 Indian youths (millennials and Generation Z) were obtained through random stratified sampling. Further, structural equation modelling was applied for data analysis and hypothesis testing. The findings suggest that the vehicle manufacturer needs to justify the high price of HFCV, and further government intervention to put a cap on the price limit is a much-needed step in this regard. Factors like openness to experience (t = 7.308), and social influence (t = 5.286) have stronger influence on consumer motivation for buying HFCVs. In addition, environmental concern (t = 3.733) and esteem needs (t = 3.11) play vital role on HFCV adoption-motivation.

We foremost analyzed the effects of hydrogen on the properties of HBNG using the Soave-Benedict-Webb-Rubin (BWRS) equation of state (EOS) owing to its lowest deviation among the concerned EOSs. Based on BWRS EOS, the fundamental differential equation, and the isenthalpic equation, we developed a thermodynamic model to evaluate the effects of hydrogen on the isenthalpic curve, Joule-Thomson coefficient (JTC), and Joule-Thomson inversion curve (JTIC) of HBNG within the hydrogen mole fraction (x-H2) range of 30%. The average absolute relative deviation (AARD) for the isenthalpic curve of the N2-H2 mixture and the JTC of natural gas is 0.02% and 1.62%. We mainly discussed how hydrogen affects the isenthalpic curve, JTC, and JTIC of HBNG. The isenthalpic curve of the CH4-H2 mixture and HBNG rise in a descending gradient with increasing x-H2. Compared to natural gas, the JTC of HBNG decreases (about 48% when x-H2 is 30%) and negatively correlates to x-H2, pressure, and temperature in a nonlinear function. The JTC is more sensitive to the x-H2 at higher temperatures and lower pressures. The blended hydrogen narrows the positive effect region of HBNG but does not turn the positive effect into a negative one within the x-H2 range of 30%. When x-H2 increases from 0% to 30%, the maximum inversion pressure and corresponding temperature drop at a rate of 0.227 MPa/x-H2% (roughly linear) and 4.9385 K/x-H2% (linear), respectively.

Hence, achieving environmental sustainability has become a global initiative to tackle the repercussions of climate change. Fossil fuel energy consumption and economic growth remain critical amidst environmental degradation and emissions. Contrary to the previous attempts, this study examines the impacts of conflicts – internal and external –, urbanization, and globalization on environmental degradation and emissions in Somalia. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model, kernelized regularized least squares (KRLS) machine learning method, and vector error correction modeling (VECM) method are utilized with annual time series data spanning 1985–2016. The empirical results show that external conflict, globalization, and urbanization increase environmental degradation in the long run but not in the short run, except globalization which has a constructive role in enhancing environmental quality in the short-run. Notably, internal conflict is inconsequential both in the short- and long-run. The results of the study are robust for various analysis methods and environmental pollution indicators. In contrast, the VECM results indicate that urbanization, economic growth, and internal and external conflicts Granger cause environmental degradation both in the short and long-run, whereas globalization causes environmental degradation in the short run only. Notably, there is bidirectional causality between urbanization and environmental degradation in the short run only. A striking result is that both internal and external conflicts are neither caused by environmental degradation nor other regressors in the short- and long-run. Hence, relevant policy implications are suggested based on the empirical findings of the study.

Although various chemicals have been added to improve the CO2 sweep efficiency, this often results in pollution to the environment and the formation. Here, a novel green foam was prepared to enhance CO2 sequestration. The stabilization mechanisms and rheological properties of the CO2 foam with cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) and camellia oleifera saponin (COS) were explored. Furthermore, the pore-scale behaviors of the CO2 foams were investigated using a micromodel. The results demonstrated that the abundant hydrogen bonds between CNFs and COS molecules led to the formation of tight bubble film which could stably encapsulate CO2 and inhibit its diffusion. The interlacement and entanglement of CNFs endowed liquid phase with high viscosity, which restrained liquid drainage and improved the interfacial viscoelasticity. The pore-scale behaviors showed that the higher viscoelasticity and stability caused large numbers of small bubbles to group together, providing greater flow resistance to control the mobility of the foam. The CNF/COS foam significantly improved the CO2 saturation in aquifers and oil reservoirs. ";"2023-06-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623011381";"17";"Emissions Other"

Recently, polygeneration systems based on renewable energies have emerged as a viable solution to support the energy transition since they can improve resource utilization and energy efficiency, thus reducing the dependency on fossil fuels and the environmental impacts on ecosystems. Renewable polygeneration systems can play a significant role in the decarbonization of the food processing industry due to its high thermal energy demand at low and medium temperature levels. This paper presents a detailed analysis of a renewable polygeneration system integrating solar, geothermal and biomass energies and able to produce electricity, heat and cold water. The novelty of this study is the analysis of polygeneration system configurations relying solely on renewable energies and the optimization of the strategy to control the energy exchange between power systems, storage facilities and utilities. Two system configurations based on different power technologies and control strategies are investigated and compared, considering as end-user a milk production process with hot and cold water requirements at different temperature levels and load profiles. To this end, a dynamic model in Matlab/Simulink has been developed to simulate the behaviour of the polygeneration system over time and evaluate its overall energy performance parameters. For each system configuration, the optimal operating strategy has been identified by maximizing the energy conversion efficiency and minimizing the unmet thermal and cooling loads. Simulation results highlighted that, compared to polygeneration systems relying only on fluctuating renewable energies, those including a backup heat source (i.e., a biomass boiler) were able to meet the thermal energy needs of larger and more complex milk production processes.

A suite of measures is needed to decarbonize the aviation sector, the most important being developing and deploying sustainable aviation fuel (SAF). Considerable interest exists in the impact of policies that incentivize the environmental services provided by SAF, and their influence on the return on investment to secure capital investment for production facilities. This paper uses financial analysis and a system dynamics approach to analyze the effect of various policies on 1) the time required for a project to reach a positive net present value (NPV), 2) the magnitude of the NPV at the end of plant life, 3) investment risk and 4) potential regional supply development. Production of SAF from municipal solid waste through gasification Fisher-Tröpsch in the U.S. is used as a case study, and the U.S. Northwest for regional development. The results indicate that a successful industry deployment entails strong support during the first three years of production to reach a positive NPV metric, after which it might be competitive with market-based initiatives or by leveraging economies of scale. Initiatives that target CO2e reductions, through criteria or purpose, generate a major impact. Alignment of strategies to increase fuel yield and emission reduction maximize profits. Stacking policies and programs, when maximizing SAF production, reduces the probability of financial loss under 13% for the three plant sizes assessed. This study demonstrates the importance of the valuation and inclusion of environmental services for project success.

This article compares the life cycle assessment of the same multi-residential building from the perspective of 16 countries participating in the international project Annex 72 of the International Energy Agency to determine the effects of different datasets and methods of accounting for biogenic carbon in wood construction. Three assessment methods are herein considered: two recognized in the standards (the so-called 0/0 method and −1/+1 method) and a variation of the latter (−1/+1* method) used in Australia, Canada, France, and New Zealand. The 0/0 method considers neither fixation in the production stage nor releases of biogenic carbon at the end of a wood product's life. In contrast, the −1/+1 method accounts for the fixation of biogenic carbon in the production stage and its release in the end-of-life stage, irrespective of the disposal scenario (recycling, incineration or landfill). The −1/+1 method assumes that landfills offer only a temporary sequestration of carbon. In the −1/+1* variation, landfills and recycling are considered a partly permanent sequestration of biogenic carbon and thus fewer emissions are accounted for in the end-of-life stage. We examine the variability of the calculated life cycle-based greenhouse gas emissions calculated for a case study building by each participating country, within the same assessment method and across the methods. The results vary substantially. The main reasons for deviations are whether or not landfills and recycling are considered a partly permanent sequestration of biogenic carbon and a mismatch in the biogenic carbon balance. Our findings support the need for further research and to develop practical guidelines to harmonize life cycle assessment methods of buildings with bio-based materials.

Here, we characterize the PAHs in 1055 samples of urban soil collected in China from 2000 to 2020. The total concentration of PAHs ranged from 2.75 to 38,865 ng g−1. PAHs concentrations in the Yangtze River Delta (YangtzeD) and Pearl River Delta exhibited an inverted U-shaped curve over time, and PAHs concentrations in Beijing have decreased. Air pollution prevention policies and vehicle emission standards in these regions reduced PAHs in the soil. We measured PAHs in soils of 18 major cities in YangtzeD, representing a typical area. Total concentration of PAHs was 3.88–2153 ng g−1 in YangtzeD, with 40.5%, 36.3%, and 23.2% of PAHs coming from industry and transportation, coal combustion, and biomass combustion, respectively by Positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. To explore how human activities affect the PAH concentrations, we screened three machine learning models and selected SHapley Additive explanation-extreme gradient boosting (XGB-SHAP) as the best model. The results of XGB-SHAP (R2 = 0.64) show that the main human activities affecting PAHs were carbon emissions, population size, and economic development (MAS = 709.1) and industrial waste gas emissions (MAS = 577.1), and these were positively correlated with PAHs. Therefore, effective ways to reduce PAHs may largely rely on industrial co-control. With the prevention and control of air pollution, clean energy, and green and low-carbon development policies constantly being implemented, PAH concentrations will continue to be reduced in the future.

Utilization of the thermal inertia of steam systems may become a means to address challenges in industrial park IES dispatch. However, researchers have less discussed the dynamic modeling and inertia quantification of industrial steam systems compared to district heating. This work proposes a dynamic hydraulic analytical model (DHAM) of steam systems reflecting the spatial and temporal transportation of steam by introducing the reference temperature and momentum linearization assumptions. Further, a steam thermal inertia model (STIM) which comprises five storage key parameters and two indexes, is developed to quantify the thermal inertia based on DHAM. Validation results of DHAM in an industrial park demonstrate that the relative error is less than 3%, achieving high accuracy. Whilst the thermal inertia of a 163-node steam system in two operation conditions is quantified and compared. Results show that the net heat storage of the steam system could reach 7440.30 kg while the positive utilization rate in both scenarios never rises above 3%. It indicates that the thermal inertia as virtual storage can fully cover the dispatching demand while is not utilized and lacks the regulation strategy of active charging in operation.

In this context, countries face the challenge of developing and directing their investments in clean energy technologies to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly affordable and clean energy. Does the development and diffusion of clean energy technologies contribute to improving environmental quality? This study addresses this question by examining the effects of clean energy technologies on sustainable environmental quality as expressed by the load capacity factor (LCF).

To this end, this paper applies the novel augmented autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to annual data from 1974 to 2018. The long-term empirical results show that (i) Clean energy technologies have no effect on the LCF; (iii) human capital supports environmental quality; (iv) urbanization has an adverse effect on environmental quality; (v) increasing economic growth worsens environmental quality. Overall, the empirical results suggest that while clean energy technologies should support sustainable environmental quality, this is unfortunately not the case in the US. Therefore, the US policymakers need to take improvement actions to ensure that clean energy technologies contribute to sustainable environmental quality and that the community reaps the environmental benefits of human capital.

Cotton is an important cash crop in China. However, only a few studies have systematically quantified the NF of cotton production in China, analyzed its temporal and spatial varieties, clarified its main constituent factors and influential factors, and explored its nitrogen emission reduction potential. This study adopts the life cycle method and analyzes the temporal-spatial varieties in the NF of cotton production in China's main cotton planting areas from 2004 to 2018 based on statistical data, analyzes the main components of the nitrogen footprint of China's cotton production, studies the main driving factors of China's cotton nitrogen emissions based on principal component analysis, simulates the nitrogen emissions of China's cotton production combined with the STIRPAT model, and comprehensively analyzes the potential nitrogen emission reduction of China's cotton production. The results indicated that the average nitrogen footprint per unit area (NFa) of cotton planting districts in Northwest China (Nw.CPD), the Yellow River Basin (Yel.RCPD) and the Yangtze River Basin (Yan.RCPD) was 112 kg Neq·ha−1, 65 kg Neq·ha−1 and 155 kg Neq·ha−1, respectively, and the NFa of cotton production in Hunan was the highest.

Climate and soil properties controls of MRT of upland soils are well known, but the drivers of C stability in paddies were never summarized. Here, we estimated MRT of paddies across monsoon Asia using the stock-over-flux method, i.e., soil organic C (SOC) stock over organic matter input considering the net primary production (NPP), and determined the main factors affecting SOC turnover. The average MRT of paddy soils in monsoon Asia ranges between 19 and 50 yr, depending on straw management. These estimates are similar to recent estimates for the global average MRT across all soils, but longer than for upland croplands. Tropical regions have the shortest MRT for rice paddies (16–42 yr), while the MRT of C in soils of temperate and subtropical regions are longer (20–56 yr). Across a wide range of environmental factors, MRT was most strongly affected by temperature. We estimate that 2 °C warming decreases MRT by 7% on average, with the strongest decreases in the western Indonesian islands and north-east China. Because C stocks per area in paddy soils are larger and the MRT is longer than in corresponding upland cropland soils, paddies play a key role in the global C cycle. Our results emphasize the need for management practices that retain stable soil C input rates to reduce possible positive feedbacks for global warming.

The connotation and composition of GLID were first analyzed, and GLID was regarded as a two-stage complex system, in which multi-input coexists with multi-output. Based on the existing methods, an improved two-stage non-cooperative data envelopment analysis (ITNDEA) is further proposed to measure GLID efficiency by taking 30 Chinese provinces in 2020 as cases, and the results are finally compared with that by two-stage data envelopment analysis (TDEA) and two-stage non-cooperative data envelopment analysis (TNDEA). The results show that: (1) ITNDEA effectively avoids the efficiency being overestimated or underestimated and can obtain a more objective and reasonable efficiency value than TDEA and TNDEA; (2) The main reason of the low GLID efficiency is the imbalance between green technology innovation and carbon emission; (3) Each policy goal has a good effect on efficiency improvement, but the effect of the same policy goal has regional difference; (4) All regions/countries can improve SD level through key breakthrough mode and gradual breakthrough mode.

When calculating biohydrogen production rate and yield, the biogas distribution in headspace and gas collection devices is often assumed to be identical. For the first time, the effect of gas generation rate and headspace volume on gas distribution in these two locations was examined. Based on abiotic studies, a model for the biogas distribution was developed and experimentally validated. The results suggested a minimum 5% and a maximum 30% difference in biogas concentration between headspace and gas collection unit when the volume of biogas produced was between 0.1 and 20 times the headspace volume. The maximum difference (ca. 30%) was detected when volume of biogas production reached 1.6 times the volume of headspace. While a precise difference was evident with abiotic experiments, such a predictable difference was not observed with biotic experiments due to the dynamic nature of biological systems. Given this difference of biogas measurements between headspace and gas collection device was largely ignored in past research, the purity of produced biohydrogen reported in some literature remains notably inaccurate, specifically when concentrations reported were derived only with a measurement of biogas in either headspace or gas collection device. Further, this error in measurement in batch experiments carried out by industry to examine biogas potential, gas quality assurance and quality control has also likely negatively impacted industry operations, industry insights, strategic decision making, and regulatory compliance. This error in biogas measurement in batch experiments can be rectified by considering the biogas composition in both headspace and gas collection device.";"2023-05-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623007990";"5";"Emissions Other"

A large number of studies have been done on the optimization of the biofuel supply chain, but few of them have considered the existing petroleum pipelines for policy reasons. Market-based reforms in the oil and gas industry have provided the possibility of pipeline sharing, whereby pipeline owners can use the remaining delivery capacity to transport other liquid fuels that are allowed into the pipeline, such as biofuels, thereby increasing pipeline benefits and reducing biofuel logistics costs. This paper develops a logistics optimization model considering multi-product pipeline scheduling from the perspective of biofuel suppliers and proposes a pipe-rail transportation mode to assess the optimization potential of logistics costs. Finally, this paper verifies the feasibility of the proposed approach using a logistics system in a region of China as a practical case study and conducts a sensitivity analysis on whether changes in the demand for product oil and biofuels affect the choice of pipeline opening location, concluding that there is no effect within a 4-fold increase in biofuel production and a 0.78-fold decrease in product oil demand.

Burning these residues results in the continuous generation of ash, accumulating over time and needing appropriate disposal. As a preliminary, the annual potential amount of rice husk and rice straw generation, the available energy that could be recovered, and potential ash generation in the Philippines were estimated in this study. More specifically, the contribution of generated ashes toward reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when used to displace part of the required cement in cement-based industries was assessed and evaluated. Residues from paddy rice could provide up to ∼10,444 GWh of electrical energy when used as fuel. Utilization of the generated fly ashes (∼634 kt rice straw fly ash and ∼267 kt rice husk fly ash) alone could, on average, reduce ∼681 kt CO2_eq annually. The transportation of the ashes before their utilization entails significant GHG emissions. However, transporting the ash within the critical distance of 2,995 km would ensure a positive net reduction. In addition, the handling and transportation cost of coal, rice, and sugarcane ashes within the archipelago was also evaluated and compared. The resulting costs (0.94–6.8 USD/40-kg bag) of different ashes are competitive with the current cement retail price (4.00–7.45 USD/40-kg bag). Potential applications, impacts, limitations, and foreseen challenges in using rice residue ashes are also discussed.

However, their potential is often limited by institutional settings or a lack of alignment with potential partners. Therefore, to exploit the potential for systemic change of business model innovations in socio-technical systems, it is necessary to consider their interactions with their wider environment. In this conceptual study, we explore the mechanisms through which business activities interact with public policy goals under low-carbon energy transitions. We take an ecosystem lens to analyze value creation at the levels of customers, business, inter-organizational networks and the public. Based on an integrative literature review, we build a conceptual meta-model specifying the constitutive elements, dynamics and environmental dimensions describing regional energy ecosystems under transition. The main constitutive element of the ecosystem is the value network, i.e. the interlinked business models of collaborating organizations exchanging money, goods, services, information or intangible benefits. The value network interacts dynamically with a pool of resources (assets, capabilities and intangible resources) that improves the ecosystem's ability to enact systemic change. Orchestration is a crucial process to steer the ecosystem's development towards creating value for customers as well as for the public. Finally, the relevant environmental dimensions include policy, culture, markets, industry structure as well as potential future members or resources. We illustrate our conceptual model with the case of the development of low-carbon district heating to decarbonize space heating in a Swiss city. This illustrative case study shows that the ecosystem perspective combined with public value theory is well suited to describe the dynamics of a low-carbon energy transition and provides valuable insights on the prospects of novel business models.";"2023-04-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623005875";"14";"Emissions Other"

Considering the influence of decision makers' subjective preferences on energy structure transformation, we introduce prospect theory and psychological account theory into the evolutionary game analysis, construct an evolutionary game model with the participation of government regulators and energy consumers, and analyze the dynamic evolution of each game subject. The results of the study show that the share of coal and clean energy in energy consumption significantly affects the strategy choice of energy consumers and government regulators. The impact of the intensity of subsidies on coal and clean energy and the resulting positive externalities on the inclusive development of coal and clean energy is nonlinear. More interestingly, the strategy combination of green regulation by government regulators and integrated energy use by energy consumers is not optimal in practice due to subjective factors such as reference effects, risk preferences, and loss aversion.

In the Pearl River Delta of China, furniture manufacturing contributes significantly to VOCs emissions, mainly from coatings. Therefore, the source substitution of coatings is the most effective way to reduce VOCs emissions. In this study, eight typical furniture enterprises with five different coatings types (traditional solvent coatings (solvent and solvent ultraviolet (UV) coatings) and low VOCs content coatings (waterborne, waterborne UV, and powder coatings)) were selected for field monitoring to reveal differences in VOCs emission characteristics, environmental impacts and health risks between traditional solvent coatings and low-VOCs coatings. The results showed that solvent coating VOCs have the highest concentration (143.32 mg/m3) and are much higher than that of solvent UV coating (45.96 mg/m3) and other coatings (≤11.81 mg/m3). The highest proportion of VOCs of solvent (UV) coating is aromatic hydrocarbons (50.73% (44.05%)). While oxygenated VOCs rank first in low-VOCs coatings (47.81%–59.20%). Compared with other coatings, the solvent coating has the greatest contribution to the formation potential of ozone and secondary organic aerosols. Meanwhile, the solvent coating has the highest carcinogenic risk of ethylbenzene in the spraying workshop (8.53 × 10−6), and only solvent coating in the spraying workshop has the non-carcinogenic risk of xylene (1.07). Finally, through scenario analysis, the environmental benefits of low-VOCs coatings substituting solvent coating were quantified. The study will help accelerate the process of source substitution of coatings and promote cleaner production in the furniture industry.

";" Enhancing forestry carbon sequestration capacity is an important way for China to achieve carbon neutrality. As such, carbon sink insurance and financial subsidies are important exploration contents for China to build a policy support system for forestry carbon sink. Based on the theoretical framework of the dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model, this study constructs a theoretical model of a forestry economic system under risk shock. Moreover, it discusses the influence of carbon sink insurance and financial subsidies on the ability of forestry to sequester carbon and increase carbon sink. Then, it explores ways to optimize the allocation of carbon sink insurance and fiscal subsidies policy tools. The results show that the operators participating in forestry carbon sink projects not only improve the forestry carbon sink ability but also enhance their own welfare level. In the case of no premium subsidy, carbon sink insurance cannot directly improve the forestry carbon sink ability but can improve the economic benefits and welfare level of operators and stabilize forest carbon sink supply. Furthermore, when the premium subsidy ratio is high enough, the method of “carbon sink insurance + premium subsidy” will improve the forestry carbon sink effect. Both direct financial subsidy and premium subsidy can improve the ability of forestry to sequester carbon and increase carbon sink and improve operators’ welfare level. However, the environmental efficiency of premium subsidy is greater than that of direct financial subsidy. Therefore, under the constraints of fiscal budget, the direct fiscal subsidy and the method of “carbon sink insurance + premium subsidy” should be used in coordination, and the carbon sink insurance premium subsidy should be given priority.

Active travel may also increase physical activity, which is beneficial for health. But it increases health burdens by directly exposing commuters to air pollution. There is a lack of generalizable quantitative approaches to comprehensively evaluate the health outcomes of sustainable plans during the design period. In this research, we aim to examine the long-term combined health impacts of commuting by walking, cycling, and e-moped in Cangzhou, China, a populous industrial city with high air pollution levels, to inform decision-making prior to the implementation of sustainable strategies.

Results show that the benefits always outweighed the risks for active commuting at the case study site, even in high polluted days. E-moped commuters experienced a negative burden. In our case, encouraging these commuters to travel during off-peak periods to reduce exposure might not be effective and could even lead to greater PM2.5 exposure than during peak periods (up to 0.37 μg/km).

A multidimensional interpretation of evidence from China ";" Digital infrastructure construction and low-carbon development are two-wheeled engines for sustainable growth; however, the causal identification of the two is not yet well known. This paper addresses this research gap by comprehensively analyzing the relationship between them. Taking China as an example, this study empirically examined the role of digital infrastructure construction in low-carbon development using threshold, quantile, and spatial model regression. Study results disclose that (i) digital infrastructure construction actively encouraged low-carbon growth. (ii) Low-carbon development had a favorable spatial spillover impact. (iii) The threshold regression results show a non-linear trend of increasing marginal effect. (iv) In addition, industrial structure upgrading can play a reinforcing role. (v) Finally, the quantile regression results showed that digital infrastructure construction could solely provide a low-carbon boost to cities with inherently high low-carbon endowments and harm cities with lower low-carbon endowments. These findings indicate that while enjoying the “low-carbon dividend” brought by digital infrastructure construction, developing countries’ governments and firms should exploit the power of industrial upgrading and regional cooperation in environmental sustainability while avoiding the negative impact of non-linear and heterogeneous endowment characteristics.

Regarding urban transportation, the Brazilian government launched the Hydrogen-bus Project (BHP) that, although the pilot project has shown high technological efficacy, is missing environmental-related studies from a systemic perspective. This work aims to assess the environmental performance of an expansion scenario for the BHP, which is small-scale and locally producing hydrogen from water electrolysis. The expansion scenario covers the entire São Paulo Metropolitan region (22 million inhabitants), modeled from a ‘well to wheel’ boundaries by including hydrogen production and use in 4076 buses, yearly traveling 265,000 km. Emergy synthesis (with ‘m’) and life cycle assessment (LCA) are applied to obtain complementary environmental indicators. LCA results show that the expansion scenario's implementation phase contributes most to fossil energy depletion (94%), acidification potential (94%), and particulate matter (70%) impact categories, while the operational phase reaches 63% of total global warming potential. Compared with diesel, electricity, liquefied petroleum gas, and biodiesel energy alternatives, the studied hydrogen scenario showed the worst figures for fossil energy depletion (4.61E-06 MJeq./km person) but the best performance for global warming (4.35E-06 kgCO2-eq./km person), acidification potential (2.40E-09 kgSO2-eq./km person), and particulate matter between 2.5 and 10 μm (8.32E-11 kgPM2.5-10/km person). From an emergy viewpoint, the operational phase demands about 96% of the invested emergy in the evaluated scenario, mostly from electricity for water electrolysis (51%) and human labor (44%). No emergy contribution for societal development as expressed by the emergy yield ratio (EYR of 1.0) is available for the evaluated scenario. Still, compared to biodiesel and diesel options, hydrogen has higher renewability (m-%R of 42%), lower environmental loading ratio (ELR of 1.4), and slightly higher emergy sustainability (m-ESI of 0.71). Generally, the hydrogen-based evaluated scenario proved to be the best option compared to diesel and biodiesel.

The crop straw cogeneration (CSC) of heat and power is an efficient renewable energy utilization technology in rural area, which is a practical solution to energy saving and pollution control. Circular economy, characterized by resource conservation, recycling and environment harmony, greatly enriches the connotation of energy projects, which is of guidance implications for the development of CSC. In this paper, the CSC project site selection is conducted under the multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) framework from the perspective of circular economy.

Biodiesel has been accepted as a promising substitute for petro-fuels in many countries because it can fulfill the requirements of the transportation industry. The present research introduces biodiesel production from Millettia pinnata (Karanja) oil utilizing waste wood apple (Limonia acidissima) shell in deriving carbonaceous catalysts in view of waste valorization for green energy generation towards alleviation of its ever-growing demand. The feedstock had a high free fatty acid (FFA) concentration based on proximate analysis, which indicated that an acid catalyst was required for fuel production.

These are the four national policy regimes to employ these policy instruments to date with varied timelines spanning from 2009 to 2050. The methodological approach employs a document review of policy texts produced by policy makers and other stakeholders. The four policy regimes are evaluated in terms of their policy design focussing on minimum performance standards, forward guidance, scope and exemptions. A key finding is that, given the range of intervening factors, side-effects and uncertainties, there are difficult choices in striking a balance between phasing implementation, providing forward guidance and adjusting policy in response to evaluation. Whilst it was initially expected that most European Union jurisdictions would default to an Energy Performance Certificate related standard, our findings show that there has been a shift towards standards that are linked to actual rather than modelled energy consumption. However, for leased stock where the owner may have limited operational control, the separation of owners' responsibility for compliance and the users’ responsibility for operations makes designing consumption-based instruments more challenging. It is concluded that a central issue in policy design has been the trade-off between minimising the financial costs to property owners and occupiers of complying with performance thresholds and maximising reductions in energy consumption. There is growing recognition that regulatory economies of scale may be achieved by targeting large properties which allows for a large proportion of the total area of the stock to be covered whilst exempting a large proportion of transactions or properties.";"2023-03-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623005000";"13";"Emissions Other"

Sustainable practices in the building sector and construction industry include incorporating passive design solutions into the building design and constructing with recycled materials. In this research the main passive design solution considered is thermal energy storage by latent heat capacity of phase change materials (PCMs). Construction with bricks is widely used in the developing world, allowing much potential for the use of recycled brick aggregate in construction composites. This research is the first of its kind on PCM inclusion by aggregate impregnation of recycled brick aggregate in 3D printed concrete (3DPC). Two cavity façade sections are 3D printed using two concrete mix designs - the first, in which 64% of the natural aggregate in the mix is replaced with recycled brick aggregate, and the second, adjusted from the first by an addition of PCM to the pores of the recycled brick aggregate by vacuum impregnation, creating concrete with a total average latent heat capacity of 7360 J/kg. These façade sections are used in four sets of thermal tests in Stellenbosch, South Africa. It is concluded that by latent heat storage, PCM delays heat transfer through the PCM-3DPC passive design façade section, significantly increasing the time that internal ambient temperatures remain within standardised ranges of thermal comfort, and reducing the maximum internal ambient temperatures by up to 3.9 °C. Minimal leakage of PCM is proven by effectiveness of the PCM in the PCM-3DPC façade section after five months of exposure to outdoor ambient spring and summer conditions.

This paper focuses on 38 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) members. Based on the scientific accounting of green eco-efficiency by the super-efficiency slack-based measure (SBM) model, the relationship between financial agglomeration and eco-efficiency is thoroughly investigated by combining the spatial Durbin model (SDM), the mediating effects model, and the panel threshold regression (PTR) model, bridging the knowledge gap. Empirical results reveal that (1) Financial agglomeration has strong positive externalities for eco-efficiency in the home country and its neighbors, with the trickle-down effect playing a key role. (2) Financial agglomeration can indirectly promote cleaner production and eco-efficiency by strengthening technological innovation and upgrading industrial structure, with the latter being more strongly mediated. (3) The effect of financial agglomeration in enhancing eco-efficiency has clear stage differences. The low-level financial agglomeration will impede the improvement of green eco-efficiency while the high-level will support it, which is in line with the Environmental Kuznets Curve theory and the law of economic development. The research broadens the theoretical underpinnings of financial agglomeration and eco-efficiency and provides guidance and implications for OECD members and other emerging economies on how to optimize the spatial allocation of financial resources, promote eco-efficiency, and advance green sustainable development.

To assist oil-producing nations in improving their energy efficiency with respect to flare gas management, it is imperative to design an energy mix that combines gas-powered and renewable energy sources. For these nations to combat the environmental degradation caused by flare gas, an optimal energy mix must be based on the maximum power that can be generated from flare gas. Towards this end, this study presents an application of the directional distance data envelopment analysis (DEA) model for estimating the required power. We applied our proposed methodology to selected nations under two different scenarios in order to determine whether data type impacted power estimates. In the first scenario, only positive data was modelled, while in the second scenario, both positive and negative real-world data were modelled. Based on initial results, the first scenario produced higher power estimates than the second scenario. For Indonesia, Iraq, Nigeria, and Venezuela, the estimated power output difference across both scenarios was 33.33%, 20.58%, 44.44%, and 2.13%, respectively. With Venezuela as a case study, and from a realistic and practical perspective, we estimated that 7050 MW of power could be generated from flare gas. Using this estimate, an optimal energy mix was designed for the nation that includes 40% gas-based power generation and 60% renewable energy. Moreover, the 40% gas proportion of the designed energy mix was found to satisfy the nation's energy shortage more than three times over in 2016. In light of our findings, we recommend our proposed methodology to policymakers as a means of improving energy efficiency through the design of energy mixes.

However, the optimal geographic location of a biorefinery plant is still a worldwide problem, from the material reception and production flow must be considered. Therefore, this study aimed to create a multi-criteria model (13 environmental and economic criteria) integrating the Geographic Information System (GIS) with Fuzzy Logic to identify potential areas for the implementation of a biorefinery within the Administrative Region of Campinas (ARC). The model created was compared with two other models, the middle center and Boolean Logic.

The results showed that biochar amendment improved thermophilic phase evolution and product dephytotoxification. During the 45-day period, in comparison to control, biochar addition promoted CH4 reduction by 44.46%–76.90% and enhanced the content of total organic carbon reduction by 20.60%–56.80%. In addition, biochar addition lowered the emissions of acetic, propanoic, isobutyric, butyric, isovaleric, and valeric acids by respectively 23.43%–41.21%, 23.10%–43.92%, 42.62%–56.11%, 26.70%–58.20%, 10.56%–58.27%, and 33.74%–49.45% compared with control values. Moreover, biochar amendment facilitated organic matter humification during biosolid bioconversion as well. Among the applied types of biochar, SDB, with a higher surface area, was more efficient in organic matter degradation and VFA emission mitigation than WHB and FRB. In particular, biochar amendment increased the abundance and diversity of aerobic bacterial communities such as Acinetobacter, Desemzia, Georgenia, Nonomuraea, Psycharobacter, Planococcus, Paenisporosarcina, Physchrobacillus, Staphylococcus, Thermobifida, and Thermopolyspora, while inhibiting the reproduction of anaerobic bacteria including Bacillus, Bacteroides, Corynebacterium, Ruminofilibacter, and Terrisporobacter during biosolid stabilization, thus improving biosolid maturity and stabilization and reducing VFA emissions.

Considering the development trend of energy consumption, this paper introduces the Logistic model of energy structure into the system structure, and establishes a novel grey prediction model with system structure. According to the division of energy factors with similar attributes, this model seeks the internal relationship of the development of electricity consumption and describes the interaction between related factors and multiple main factors in the form of equations, which makes the model have better applicability and stability. In the validation part, the ten types of energy are divided according to their attributes, and the main factor group and the related factor group are distinguished. The model proposed in this paper is used for simulation and prediction, and is compared with the three types of models (six models). In the two cases, the simulation error of the new model is as low as 3.9790%, and the prediction error is 0.5645%. Compared with other models, the new model has shown good performance in the case of electricity consumption forecasting in China. The effectiveness of the optimization of the model in structure, background, and application is verified.

Currently, the research on China's nitrogen footprint lacks the exploration of regional differentiation, and the local virtual Nitrogen factor (VNF) is also insufficient. In this study, we developed localized VNF at the provincial level in China and then applied them to measure the per capita food production Nitrogen footprint of 31 provinces in mainland China from 1998 to 2018 by employing a modified N-Calculator model. We found that the national per capita food production N footprint varied from 15.30 to 21.09 kg/year over the past 20 years. Per capita food production N footprint of 29 provinces increased, ranging from 13% to 113%. The dominance of the food production N footprint of meat gradually increased, and the differences between regions showed a decreasing trend.

A life cycle approach and a multi-criteria decision support method were applied to know the environmental, functional, and economic performances of the production process of half-sandwich panels based on alkali-activated ceramic/slag waste cement, choosing as system boundary the method “cradle to gate”. The proposed building solutions differ from each other in the type of insulating material used, either extruded polystyrene foam (APXPS) or expanded cork agglomerate board (APICB). Besides, a comparative analysis of the developed building solutions versus three reference constructive solutions: i) a conventional heavyweight partition wall, ii) a lightweight gypsum wall panel, and iii) a conceptual lightweight sandwich membrane building solution was performed. Results showed that the two proposed half-sandwich wall panels (APXPS and APICB) resulted in the most sustainable alternatives, of which the APXPS obtained the best overall results since it combined the best environmental, functional, and economic behavior. Besides, the environmental contribution analysis determined that the greatest environmental burden to the Global Warming Potential (GWP), in the case of the APXPS was associated with the XPS (57%), being the alkali activator (23%) placed as the second major contributor. When the ICB was used as the insulation layer, the energy used (nearly 38%) and the sodium silicate (about 17%) were the larger contributors to CO2 emissions.

This study estimated the current status and long-term trends of PM2.5 in the North Korean capital, Pyongyang, using an empirical visibility–relative humidity (RH)–PM2.5 relationship obtained from the South Korean capital, Seoul. The visibility–RH–PM2.5 relationship was derived from PM2.5 and meteorological variables for the period of 2003–2018 in Seoul, excluding days affected by hydrometeor conditions; it was applied to long-term meteorological data for the period of 1983–2018 in both Seoul and Pyongyang. In recent years (2016–2018), the average estimated PM2.5 concentration in Seoul was ∼23 μg m−3, which was close to the measured concentration of ∼25 μg m−3. The average estimated PM2.5 concentration in Pyongyang for the same period was ∼35 μg m−3. The estimated PM2.5 concentration in Seoul was generally high before 2000 (∼34 μg m−3); it decreased beginning in the 2000s (−5.2 μg m−3 per 10 years) because of the emission control policy and meteorological phenomena. The estimated PM2.5 concentration in Pyongyang significantly decreased until 1998 (−5.9 μg m−3 per 10 years), then increased from 1999 to 2018 (+8.5 μg m−3 per 10 years). The growth in gross national income, total primary energy supply, and coal-fired thermal electricity generation implied that the long-term changes in the estimated PM2.5 concentration in Pyongyang were closely related to the economic contraction and recovery of North Korea.

This paper presents an integrated modeling framework to address the regional biomass power generation planning to facilitate biomass utilization in developing countries. By combining the geographic information system, multi-criteria decision-making approach, as well as the type-2 fuzzy inexact programming method, the proposed integrated framework could assist the optimal decision-making for the specific site and size selection of biomass power plants in the whole region as well as the optimal operation strategies under deep uncertainties. The proposed modeling framework is applied to the particular context of Henan, an agricultural province in China with great biomass potential. The results suggested that biomass power plants with a total capacity of 2.4 GW could be established, which could satisfy 6% of local electricity consumption and avoid 18.51 Mt of carbon emissions. The sensitivity analysis of the main economic parameters indicated that lower investment and operation costs were essential to stimulate the utilization of local biomass energy. A higher feed-in tariff is not encouraged due to the limited incentive effect but is a heavy burden for the government. Furthermore, the optimal strategies for biomass power generation planning under uncertainties could be suggested for different decision makers with various risk preferences to achieve a tradeoff between system cost and risk.

";" This paper constructs the ecological footprint accounts for 30 provinces in China, and explores the effects of environmental policies from the perspective of various ecological footprints. We innovatively focus on the impact which pollution fees superseded environmental protection tax on ecological footprints. The effects of these two environmental policies in China is compared with the panel smooth transition regression model (PSTR). In comparison with pollution fees, environmental protection tax has a stronger inhibition on ecological footprints. Pollution fees can lessen the cropland's ecological footprint, but this negative effect presents marginal diminishing. As for the ecological footprints of fishing grounds and fossil energy land, when pollution fees exceed 2.002 and 2.011 (‱ of GDP) respectively, there will be a restraining effect. Pollution fees has no effect on reducing the ecological footprints of grazing land, forest land, infrastructure, and the total. The environmental protection tax has a negative impact of linearity on the ecological footprints of fishing grounds and forest land. When environmental protection tax exceeds the corresponding thresholds (1.226, 3.482, 1.867 and 3.083), it will decrease the ecological footprints of grazing land, infrastructure, fossil energy land, and the total. The negative effect of environmental protection tax on cropland's ecological footprint is not obvious. Further, the change charts of influence coefficient on ecological footprints are drawn to directly reflect the optimal tax range for environmental protection tax to diminish ecological footprints. The heterogeneity analysis reveal that the current environmental protection tax only inhibits the total ecological footprint of eight provinces, mostly in northern China.

The latter are forced to new negotiations with other potential energy suppliers, to urgent internal measures to reduce energy demand and, at the same time, to fulfil their commitments to internationally agreed climate targets, where the energy transition is a key strategy. A sustainable energy transition strategy is also essential in circular economy implementation (CE), requiring the replacement of fossil energies with renewable ones. In turn, the energy transition should meet the CE principles to reduce the consumption of natural resources and the contribution to climate change. In this context, this study assesses the environmental impacts of the Italian and EU electricity mixes under different governmental and research scenarios and perspectives, by means of the Life Cycle Assessment approach (Midpoint and Endpoint LCA). Results show that the shift from the BAU electricity mix (year 2021) to the emergency Government plan scenario (2021–2023) replacing 14% of Russian natural gas by means of 42% oil and coal and 58% renewables slightly reduces the contribution to Midpoint LCA impact indicators, including global warming and fossil resource scarcity, while still contributing to particulate matter formation, terrestrial acidification, eco-toxicity and water consumption. The contribution to global warming further decreases in the other modelled scenarios, where natural gas is assumed to decrease from 30% to a high 60% in favour of renewables (Governmental plan 2030 scenario). Other impacts, in particular terrestrial and human toxicity, are instead expected to worsen, calling for much needed improvement of renewable technologies. Further, the Endpoint LCA impact indicators, expressed as DALY (human health damage), lost species potential (biodiversity damage) and increased costs for the extraction of mineral and fossil resources, improve in the Governmental Plan 2030 scenario and other modelled options. LCA shows to be a key method for the energy transition, in order to identify hotspots of modelled electricity scenarios and suggest more environmentally, circular and socially just improvement solutions. The adoption of the concept of CE in energy transition entails the expansion of the boundaries of an LCA to include the end-of-life of renewable technologies (so-called “cradle to cradle” approach) and the assessment of the most successful options to mitigate the environmental and social impacts of energy transition.";"2023-02-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623000495";"40";"Emissions Other"

However, whether the public supports this initiative is not well understood. This study investigates rural households' (in the Shandong province, China) willingness to pay (WTP) for retrofitting rooftops with SPVT to promote the GALCET and determines the WTP drivers.

Herein, designated dopants (yttrium, magnesium, zinc, nickel, or tin) with different electron affinity were facilely incorporated into alumina supported palladium-cobalt catalysts (Pd/C-A) to realize the efficient methane combustion. The incorporation of dopants effectively tuned the microstructure, surface property and electronic state of catalysts, and their catalytic activity showed an inverted volcano trend with the increased electronegativity of dopants. The Mg dopant with a relatively low electronegativity provided additional electrons to participate in the Pd–Co interaction, which not only increased the ratio of active Pd4+ and Co2+ species, but also promoted the conversion of Pd↔PdOx and depressed the accumulation of –OH species. Consequently, the Mg doped catalyst presented a remarkably higher catalytic activity, stability and water-resistance than Pd/C-A. The proposed electron modification strategy can be further extended to rationally screen dopants and construct active sites for catalytic applications.

Several sensor-based systems have been developed for real-time PM monitoring. However, because construction sites are complex and large, there are limitations in installation areas and system costs. However, to overcome such limitations, the possibility of estimating PM using only emission factors, without direct measurement, has been confirmed. Nevertheless, most studies to date have evaluated the impact of PM outside the construction site, and the potential to monitor PM inside construction sites is still unclear. To bridge these knowledge gaps, this study estimated the PM inside a construction site with the application of emission factors and compared the estimated PM with that measured by the sensor at three actual construction sites. The comparison results showed that the Pearson's correlation coefficients ranged between 0.516 and 0.882, which varied according to the different site conditions and equipment used, and all had a positive correlation. Thus, the possibility of real-time on-site PM monitoring using emission factors is confirmed. In addition, the deviation in the comparison results presents improvement opportunities for practical use. The proposed monitoring system will contribute to the construction industry by supporting sustainable and safe construction environments.

Evidence from the difference-in-differences model ";" Urbanization has an important impact on building energy consumption. Unfortunately, whether the later-urbanized provincial regions are more energy-efficient than those early-urbanized regions in the building sector is still unclear. This study innovatively adopts the difference-in-differences (DID) model to examine the event effect of urbanization on building energy intensity with China's provincial evidence from 2000–2015. Moreover, its influence mechanism is identified with the mediating effect model. Results demonstrate that: (1) The building energy intensity is higher in provincial regions where the urbanization rate reached 45% earlier, indicating that the later-urbanized regions are more energy-efficient. (2) Considering heterogeneity, the event of urbanization rate reaching 45% contributes positively to building energy intensity in the eastern and central regions, but the effect in the western region is insignificant. This can further validate the later-mover advantage of the urbanization. (3) Regarding influence mechanism, urbanization can drive building energy intensity by increasing the proportion of the tertiary industry and population density or reducing the proportion of building coal consumption and the plot ratio of the urban area. This study can facilitate the related theoretical and practical exploration of the event effect of urbanization on energy consumption, which is conducive to formulating differentiated energy-conservation strategies.

However, as already available for dairy and beef cattle, empirical models are needed to predict CH4 emissions from sheep for accounting purposes. The objectives of this study were to: 1) collate an intercontinental database of enteric CH4 emissions from individual sheep; 2) identify the key variables for predicting enteric sheep CH4 absolute production (g/d per animal) and yield [g/kg dry matter intake (DMI)] and their respective relationships; and 3) develop and cross-validate global equations as well as the potential need for age-, diet-, or climatic region-specific equations. The refined intercontinental database included 2,135 individual animal data from 13 countries. Linear CH4 prediction models were developed by incrementally adding variables. A universal CH4 production equation using only DMI led to a root mean square prediction error (RMSPE, % of observed mean) of 25.4% and an RMSPE-standard deviation ratio (RSR) of 0.69. Universal equations that, in addition to DMI, also included body weight (DMI + BW), and organic matter digestibility (DMI + OMD + BW) improved the prediction performance further (RSR, 0.62 and 0.60), whereas diet composition variables had negligible effects. These universal equations had lower prediction error than the extant IPCC 2019 equations. Developing age-specific models for adult sheep (>1-year-old) including DMI alone (RSR = 0.66) or in combination with rumen propionate molar proportion (for research of more refined purposes) substantially improved prediction performance (RSR = 0.57) on a smaller dataset. On the contrary, for young sheep (<1-year-old), the universal models could be applied, instead of age-specific models, if DMI and BW were included. Universal models showed similar prediction performances to the diet- and region-specific models. However, optimal prediction equations led to different regression coefficients (i.e. intercepts and slopes) for universal, age-specific, diet-specific, and region-specific models with predictive implications. Equations for CH4 yield led to low prediction performances, with DMI being negatively and BW and OMD positively correlated with CH4 yield. In conclusion, predicting sheep CH4 production requires information on DMI and prediction accuracy will improve national and global inventories if separate equations for young and adult sheep are used with the additional variables BW, OMD and rumen propionate proportion. Appropriate universal equations can be used to predict CH4 production from sheep across different diets and climatic conditions.";"2023-01-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622050971";"23";"Emissions Other"
"10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135566";"Exploring limits to tree planting as a natural climate solution ";" Large-scale tree planting has been advocated for decades in many countries as a cost-effective strategy to mitigate carbon, rejuvenate degraded landscapes, and support local livelihoods. Recent studies, however, suggest limited ecological and livelihood impacts of tree planting programs, indicating possible limits to tree planting as a natural climate solution. In this paper, we explore these carrying capacity-like limits by evaluating the site suitability of forestry landscapes of the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh using theory/expert-based rules and machine learning algorithms. We find that the state can only achieve a maximum of 31.54% forest cover due to socio-ecological and biophysical constraints, much less than India's goal of bringing 66% of the total geographical area of Himalayan states into forest cover. The low availability of suitable lands for growing trees, together with poor plantation site selection by forest range officers limit the use of tree planting as a sole climate mitigation strategy. To approach theoretical planting limits, we propose an ePSA (e-Plantation Site Assistant) recommendation system based on our site-suitability results to assist forest rangers in selecting suitable sites for planting trees. An initial deployment of the recommender system suggests its potential utility in shaping the long-term success of tree plantations as an effective carbon strategy in northern India and beyond. Overall, we argue that there is a need to realign over-ambitious national and international tree planting targets with actual limits from site characteristics to avoid massive wastage of funds and to obtain feasible carbon mitigation outcomes.

However, we challenge the assumption that stakeholders generally recognize and punish firms’ environment-damaging behavior. Instead, we draw on the Broken Windows Theory of urban decline and hypothesize that increasing urban air pollution is likely to result in lower CEP. We also theorize on how some city characteristics can moderate our baseline hypothesis. Specially, we hypothesize that firms in more developed cities and in larger cities tend to increase their CEP as urban air pollution increases.

A dairy farm with an annexed biogas plant produces three outputs, milk, meat and electricity, and should be considered as a single system for the evaluation of the environmental impact. The aim of this study was to investigate to what extent the size and feeding methods of the biogas plants in three dairy farms with different features affect the environmental impact related to the milk and electricity produced. The first farm was characterized by a biogas plant of 300 kW fed only with cattle manure, the second farm had a plant of 526 kW fed with cattle manure, maize silage and waste of maize grain production, while the third farm had a biogas plant of 999 kW fed with cattle and poultry manure, maize and triticale silage, and fats from slaughterhouse waste. The Life Cycle Assessment involved the environmental impact of Fat Protein Corrected Milk (FPCM), in the first instance with meat and electricity from biogas considered with an economic allocation, and then considered a credit. Successively, the environmental consequences of electricity were evaluated considering milk and meat as credits. With the economic allocation, Carbon Footprint (CFP) of one kg of FPCM was 0.82, 0.85 and 0.72 kg CO2 eq in the first, second and third farm, respectively. In all the three farms, electricity generation from biogas determined a reduction in the environmental impact of milk production thanks to a credit of emissions provided by the production of renewable energy. Milk CFP in the three farms was 0.82, 0.91 and 0.13 kg CO2 eq respectively, with mitigation from biogas of 11%, 11% and 85%. The best performances were obtained in the third farm thanks to higher levels of electricity generation, covered digestate storage and the large use of agri-industrial waste. Electricity CFP in the farms was −0.74, −0.68 and −0.06 kg CO2 eq/kWh respectively. Environmental consequences of electricity production from biogas plants were compensated in all the farms thanks to the credits provided by milk; this compensation was as greater as the ratio between milk and electricity production and the first farm reached better outcomes. In the context of reducing the environmental impact of animal foods and implementing an ecological transition to reach national and European goals for renewable energy production, the work could be beneficial to assess which combination between dairy and energy products should be promoted.

A case study from Western Norway ";" Forest management is an important tool for GHG mitigation by representing three carbon pools: living biomass, forest soil, and wood-based products. Additionally, increasing attention has been given to the potential for wood products to substitute fossil-intensive products as a climate mitigation strategy. The goal of this paper is to analyse the theoretical GHG effects of fully replacing four common non-wood products with wood-based products of ‘low’ and ‘high’ technology options that have a similar functionality: (1) Spruce particle board substituting polyurethane (PU) foam insulation board; (2) spruce cross-laminated timber beam (CLT) substituting steel beam; (3) birch energy wood substituting electric heating; and (4) birch plywood substituting plaster board. The analysis was based on forestry in Western Norway as a case study, where forests typically consist of naturally generated birch and expanding areas of planted Norway spruce. In this study we compare wood products derived from paired stands of Norway spruce and downy birch. The analysis showed that spruce gave a higher theoretical substitution effect relative to birch for the selected pairs of woody and non-woody products. CLT substituting steel beam gave the highest substitution effect, approximately 15% higher than particle board substituting PU foam board. The theoretical substitution effect in mass units of carbon per kg wood product for the two spruce wood products was approximately 17 times higher relative to substituting Norwegian hydro energy-based electric heating, whereas plywood substituting plaster board may in fact increase GHG emissions. As the gross emissions were relatively similar for the birch plywood and the spruce particle board, the major substitution effect was related to the avoided emission of the non-woody product rather than to the tree species per se. The paper concludes that the choice of product to be substituted was the key factor that determined the final substitution effects. Furthermore, the study showed that transportation was the single most important factor that affected the emissions between planting and delivery of the timber at production gate. The analysis enables informed decisions related to CO2-emissions at the various steps from tree planting to wood conversion, and underline the importance of informed decision related to the choice of substitution products.

Beyond a sense of cultural identity and tradition, gastronomy also represents a pole of tourist attraction. This is the case of Galicia, a region in north-western Spain. Within this framework, local dishes, which include distinctive elements of the Atlantic diet, have gained popularity. This research delves into the sustainability of 60 Galician recipes by performing a hierarchical cluster analysis to study their carbon footprint, the energy return on investment ratio and cost. The life cycle assessment methodology was followed to account for the carbon footprint and the energy return on investment ratio of the recipes. The scope was bounded to the cradle-to-fork phases through the life cycle: production of the ingredients, transport, and meal preparation. The functional unit selected was one serving of a Galician meal. The results suggest that the recipes could be classified into three main groups according to the presence of a greater or lesser amount of animal-based products. Cluster 1 comprises 10 meat recipes. Cluster 2 encompasses 31 recipes rich in fish with some vegetables and moderate consumption of red meat and dairy products. Cluster 3 includes 22 vegetable-based recipes. The higher the portion of animal products in the recipes (mainly red meat), the higher the costs and carbon footprint and the lower the energy return on investment ratio. Conversely, plant-based recipes tend to reduce greenhouse gases emissions and increase cost competitiveness and energy efficiency indicators. Based on this study, the food service could promote eco-labelling that support and certify restaurant menus. This research could also provide transformative climate education for sustainable food for consumers, giving advice to improve food-based dietary guidelines in Spain.";"2023-01-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622049344";"7";"Emissions Other"

We further analyze the spatial-temporal dynamics of sizes and areas of photovoltaic solar power plants and major land cover conversion of expansive photovoltaic regions. Finally, we discuss the reliability, uncertainties, implications, and future development of our improved methods. We find our photovoltaic mapping method can remove most of salt-and-pepper noises effectively, and the resultant maps in Gansu for 2020 have very high accuracies with user's and producer's accuracies of 97.57% and 99.22%, respectively. There are 165.29 km2 photovoltaic solar power plants in Gansu for 2020, and most of which are located in the northwestern Gansu. In addition, the photovoltaic with patch size > 1 km2 and ≤ 2 km2 (53.4 km2, 32.3%) has largest patch number (39, 15.7%). The improved photovoltaic mapping methods and further analysis in this study provide critical information for accurate and automatic classification of photovoltaic solar power plants in the future, as well as the environmental and sustainable development of solar energy in China.

The results of the 4 E analyzes show that the PTC had the highest energy efficiency (73.6%) in July and the highest exergy efficiency (20.11%) in January. From the exergoeconomic and exergoenvironmental analyzes, it is determined that the solar collector in June had the lowest cost per unit of useful exergy produced (70.17 $/GJ), the highest bonus due to saving carbon dioxide production (0.0193 $/h), and also the lowest amount of environmental impact per unit of useful exergy produced (17.56 mPts/GJ). Then, the sensitivity of energy and exergy efficiencies as well as the cost per unit of useful exergy produced and the environmental effect on the unit of useful exergy produced in relation to the climate changes (solar radiation intensity, ambient temperature, and wind speed); were investigated. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that increasing the intensity of solar radiation, decreasing the ambient temperature, and decreasing the wind speed can lead to improving the exergy, economic, and environmental performance of PTC. Also, the multi-objective genetic algorithm has been used to optimize PTC to improve the design parameters and operating conditions. The optimization results show that the exergy efficiency and the total cost of the optimized PTC (for January which had the maximum exergy efficiency) are 26.38% and 0.61 dollars per hour, respectively.

Hydrogen production through the use of electrocatalysts is becoming increasingly popular as a sustainable and efficient method. Herein, we report the monodisperse nickel (Ni) nanoparticles incorporated molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) (Ni/MoS2) electrocatalyst synthesized via a hydrothermal method, followed by an annealing process. It is found that the edge dislocations which are topological defects that occur when a crystal lattice has an extra plane of atoms. These defects can drastically affect the chemical properties and electronic structure of materials, which can improve their electrocatalytic performance. However, defect-rich electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is becoming more popular nowadays. It is not yet clear how the active sites of the edge dislocations of MoS2 affect the catalytic properties of hydrogen evolution. The most promising electrocatalyst without precious metals is considered to be metallic MoS2 (1T phase), which exhibits Pt-like HER performance in alkaline media. One of the expected functions of MoS2 is to act as a conductive support with relatively large surface area for more catalytically active and highly dispersed Ni species. The 1T-MoS2 exhibits remarkable catalytic properties for HER due to the abundance of active sites connected by edge dislocations. Compared with pristine MoS2, the edge dislocation defect-rich Ni/MoS2 shows the outstanding HER activity, delivering a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of only 89 mV with a lower Tafel slope of 59 mV dec−1. Additionally, chronopotential analysis is performed at a constant current density of 10 mA cm−2 for 30 h with minimal loss in overpotential, which demonstrates an extremely potential and stable HER catalyst.

Metals such as cerium and copper as bimetallic centers were coordinated with citric acid to mimic FeMo bimetallic active center in the M cluster. The results show that the morphology, structure and photocatalytic activity of the catalysts has been significantly affected by the amount of citric acid.

Such heat sinks ensure better electrical output power and efficiency at a cheaper cost. Thus, the present research focuses on the passive thermal regulation of a triple-junction solar cell utilizing four different finned heat sink configurations; (A) flat plate, (B) straight fins, (C) pin fins, and (D) flared fins heat sink. A comprehensive 3D thermal and electrical model is developed and computationally simulated, incorporating the cell module layers coupled with the aluminium heat sink.

In hot climatic conditions (40 °C and 1 m/s), the integration of the proposed heat sink configurations A, B, C, and D enables the cell to operate safely (below 110 °C) at high concentration ratios of 440 suns, 1435 suns, 1250 suns, and 1775 suns, respectively, and produce large electric power of 15.2 W/cm2, 49.7 W/cm2, 43.3 W/cm2, and 61.4 W/cm2.

However, the effects of optimizing irrigation and fertilization management on N loss in paddy fields across China have not been evaluated comprehensively. In this study, we collected the data for synthetic N fertilizer application and irrigation water consumption in the paddy fields of China from 1979 to 2020 and 2004 to 2020, respectively. Synthetic N fertilizer use and irrigation water consumption in China increased by 145% and 54% during these periods, respectively. Based on the N fertilization rate and irrigation regimes, we constructed a N loss model and estimated the synthetic fertilizer-induced N loss from paddy fields. The N loss from paddy fields increased rapidly in 1979–1998, followed by significant fluctuations in 1998–2007, reaching a peak of 1.65 Tg in 2007 and decreasing steadily to 1.03 Tg in 2020. Notably, ammonia (NH3) volatilization was the dominant pathway of total N loss, followed by N runoff, N leaching, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, contributing to 60.15%, 23.69%, 15.04% and 1.12% of the total loss on average, respectively. High N loss rates mainly occurred in the Yangtze river basin and Southeast coastal rice regions. When applying the optimal N management, water-saving irrigation regimes, and a combination of optimal N and water management, the N loss would decrease by 18.15%, 10.36%, and 26.29%, respectively. By the wide application of optimal N and water management, the N fertilizer use, irrigation water consumption, and N loss were likely to decrease by 0.55 Tg yr−1, 1.55 × 109 yuan yr−1, and 0.36 Tg N yr−1, respectively. Consequently, the net economic benefit rates became positive at the national scale, with the cost of N loss and water consumption reductions being 30.14% and 26.41%, respectively. Our study confirms that optimizing N application and irrigation management in paddy fields has noticeable potential to ensure the green agricultural sustainability and food security in China.

To explore the pollution risk, sources and trends of pollution trace elements in Dongshan Bay, a typical aquaculture bay in China, the concentration and spatial distribution of seven trace elements in surface sediments were investigated. In this study, Zn was the element with the highest content in surface sediments, followed by Pb and Cr, while Cd was the lowest, but the average concentrations of Cd and Hg exceeded the regional background values. High levels of trace elements were distributed in estuaries and aquaculture areas, which were illustrated also by the SOM model.

This paper therefore investigates the impact of electricity production on the Water-Energy-Food nexus sectors and on carbon emissions in South Africa. To do this, we conduct a lifecycle assessment of the water and land required for electricity production, as well as its carbon emissions in South Africa, by electricity source, and under key scenarios.

Three scrubbing liquids, weak and strong ammoniacal water produced by the strippers and sodium hydroxide solution, are used in the scrubber. Rate-based modeling is used for both the scrubber and the strippers. The model can accurately predict hydrogen sulfide and ammonia concentration in vapor sampled from multiple locations in the scrubber. The effects of the scrubbing liquid flow rates on the scrubbing efficiency is studied with a sensitivity analysis. It is found that increasing the flow rate of strong ammoniacal water can improve the hydrogen sulfide scrubbing efficiency. Increasing the flow rate of weak ammoniacal water can enhance both hydrogen sulfide and ammonia scrubbing efficiency. However, the pH of the wastewater produced by the process also increases, which may adversely affect the wastewater treatment process. Using more sodium hydroxide solution can effectively enhance hydrogen sulfide scrubbing efficiency, but its effect on the pH of the wastewater is profound. These results can provide guidance for improved operation of this process and similar processes.

This study coupled hydrological modeling with future climate and urbanization scenarios from Representative Concentration Pathways and Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP), to spatiotemporally investigate the risk of flood exposure and the effectiveness of mitigation strategy at the city scale. A highly urbanized (80% of built-up areas) and densely populated (7500 per km2) region in downtown Chaohu, China was selected as the study case. Results showed that the current hydrological pattern brought 4.64 × 106 m3 of annual runoff and 292.00 l s−1 of peak flow to the given area, thereby causing 41.03% of the population to be exposed to flooding threats and putting 51.17% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) at risk. Scenario analysis demonstrated that population and GDP exposures to flood increased to at most 61.11 and 71.30% in high-carbon emission scenarios (SSP3-7.0/SSP5-8.5), respectively. The green infrastructure (GI) strategy captured at most 81.43% of runoff volume and 54.53% of peak flow, thereby decreasing population and GDP exposures to at least 18.38 and 33.04% in low-carbon emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6/SSP2-4.5), respectively. According to the uncertainty analysis, population and GDP exposures showed wide uncertainty ranges of 18.38–61.11 and 33.04–71.30% in future scenarios, and the GI strategy effectively decreased the flood exposure uncertainty ranges to 15.56–42.70 and 17.35–43.60%, respectively. In addition, the spatial analysis indicated that the population- and GDP- intensive regions were more vulnerable to flood exposure than other regions, while GI strategy in these regions showed limited effectiveness in mitigation of exposure risk. The data of this study could assist sustainable urban development in response to climate change and urbanization.

The economic viability and environmental footprint of PF facilities depend on energy consumption associated with lighting, heating, ventilation, and cooling to the production space. Light and energy-system modeling can inform designers and investors about the energy requirements and economics related to a proposed or existing facility. Previous models have focused on comparing energy consumption between PFs and greenhouses (GH) in a limited number of production scenarios. There is little information regarding water consumption and carbon emissions at PF facilities and how energy conservation measures (ECMs) may impact water use efficiency, upstream emissions and purchased carbon-dioxide. The objective of this study is to model energy and water use in PFs growing lettuce in five U.S. locations (New York, NY, Los Angeles, CA, Seattle, WA, Chicago, IL, and Atlanta, GA) with three types of ECMs: installing lighting fixtures with high photon efficacy, introducing outdoor air for cooling through use of an air-side economizer, and maintaining elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the crop production space to enhance photosynthesis. Building energy modeling (BEM) software EnergyPlus was employed to simulate environmental conditions and associated energy consumption. Energy consumption ranges from 6.2 to 12.0 kWh kg−1 fresh weight of lettuce produced depending on design and operational choices. Water consumption for irrigation and production operations ranges between 2.0- and 9.8-L of water per kg (FW) lettuce produced. Beyond operating parameters, the primary emissions associated with energy consumption at the facility varies widely due to the energy mix of each location's grid, ultimately ranging between 0.6 and 3.9 kg carbon dioxide equivalent emissions per kg (FW) lettuce produced. We conclude that locating PFs in areas with a cleaner grid and employing these ECMs can reduce the energy consumption associated with growing lettuce indoors, though there are important tradeoffs to consider between water, energy, and supplemental carbon-dioxide in design.

The effects on the environment from hemodialysis treatment in Mexico have not been quantified. In the world, the studies carried out to date measure the environmental impacts based on CO2eq, so they do not reveal other types of effects generated by this type of treatment. The objective of this study is to estimate the environmental impact of hemodialysis in 17 impact categories using life cycle assessment (LCA). The phases of this study were carried out following the guidelines of ISO 14040–14044, considering as a functional unit the replacement of renal function, artificially employing a hemodialysis machine in a patient for one year. The unitary processes of the system with the highest environmental loads were the patients and staff transportation and hemodialysis. The contribution analysis yielded 17 significant variables greater than 5% of the impact. The carbon footprint of artificial kidney care, by stage of the life cycle, is distributed as follows: transport (36%), kidney service (36%), and end of life (28%). The LCA approach allowed the inclusion of other environmental effects of health services to understand the impacts better.

In this study, we report a microbead-coated polyacrylonitrile nanofibrous membranes (MB-NFMs) filter, which is a reusable PAN nanofiber-based air filter with high dust-filtration efficiency. The MB-NFMs filter comprises a dual-layer structure composed of hydrophilic PAN nanofibers coated with hydrophobic microbeads to produce high filtration efficiency and water droplet cleaning ability. This membrane has water contact angles of approximately 144°, which allows water droplets to roll off its surface and carry captured dust particles with them. Furthermore, we discovered that the MB-NFMs filter has sufficient wetting resistance to maintain its hydrophobicity under raindrop impacts. The MB-NFMs filter had a removal efficiency of over 99.8% for PM2.5. Repetitive dust-filtration and water droplet-cleaning cycles were performed to evaluate the MB-NFMs filter's ability to clean water droplets. The filtration efficiency was higher than 99.8% throughout the tests, and the pressure drop was recovered by 99% after each cleaning cycle. The fabricated MB-NFMs filter is a viable solution for highly efficient and reusable dust-particle filtration. The MB-NFMs filter does not require periodic maintenance due to its water droplet cleaning ability, providing an economic advantage over conventional air filters.

This inflation has a direct impact on households and businesses, by increasing production costs. It risks slowing the global economic recovery by reducing purchasing power and consumption. This study presents a new mixed-integer non-linear programming (MINLP) model with the objective of cost minimization within the direct supply chain of the textile and clothing industry. To consider different aspects in our study, the cost function is decomposed to the supply, production, energy, transportation, storage, and carbon tax emissions costs. It deals also with the management of multiple energy sources (specifically, electricity for production and fuel for transportation). This model simultaneously incorporates several critical factors, including life cycle assessment, carbon tax emissions, and planning horizon. To do this, a product’s carbon emissions are quantified from raw material extraction through to the finished product, and three different planning horizons as long term t= ∞ , medium term t=3 month, and short term t=1 month are considered to evaluate their impacts on the costs and emissions values. A shorter planning horizon leads to increased costs and reduced emissions reductions compared to a medium or long-term planning horizon. Additionally, the study introduces a new benchmark based on real-world data available in the literature, which serves as a valuable tool for evaluating strategic and tactical planning issues within textile supply chains. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, we defined three different size of the problem by changing the number of factories, suppliers, production sites, warehouses and customers. The study’s findings reveal that, over a medium and long-term planning horizon, there is an average cost increase of about 2% for different problem sizes, when considering a carbon tax ranging from 44.6€ to 86.2€ per tonne of emissions. When a higher carbon tax is applied, the total cost increases, while the carbone emissions and subcontracting activities will be decrease.

In the context of climate warming and degradation of agricultural soil fertility, it becomes crucial to explore the mechanisms of soil respiration to increase carbon sequestration. In this paper, five biochar applications (0, 3.79, 7.58, 11.36, 15.15 t/ha) and two tillage methods (shallow ploughing, deep ploughing) were set up to explore the mechanism of soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity by studying the effects of tillage methods and different amounts of biochar application on soil properties, soil enzyme activities, soil respiration and its temperature sensitivity during the growing season of soybeans in the black soil area. The results showed that soil respiration rate increased with biochar application in the low biochar application range; the opposite trend was observed for high biochar application beyond the threshold (11.36 t/ha). The application of 11.36 t/ha of biochar amount had the strongest promotion effect on soil respiration, reaching 2.42 μmol m−2·s−1 in the shallow ploughing treatment and increasing 0.32 μmol m−2·s−1 in the deep ploughing compared to the shallow ploughing. The application of biochar significantly increased the activity of nitrogen and phosphorus enzymes and had an inhibitory effect on carbon cycle enzymes; the increased activity of nitrogen and phosphorus cycle enzymes provided sufficient substrate for microbial respiration and thus increased soil respiration, and the decrease in the enzymatic reaction of carbon cycle enzymes led to a decrease in temperature sensitivity. The temperature sensitivity of deep ploughing (2.18–2.59) got a more substantial reduction than that of shallow ploughing (2.34–3.53), which indicates that deep ploughing treatments can better reduce the mineralization of organic carbon than shallow tillage. Meanwhile, the temperature sensitivity of soil respiration reached a minimum with the application of 7.58 t/ha of biochar, which was reduced by 16% under deep ploughing treatment compared to the control, 33% under shallow ploughing treatment compared to the control, and also reduced by 27.27% under deep ploughing compared to shallow ploughing, which suggests that the addition of biochar reduces the loss of carbon to a certain extent. This study is important for assessing the effects of tillage practices and biochar combinations on carbon sequestration in agricultural soils in black soil areas.

However, few in situ longitudinal studies are available to quantify these changes. Here, we combined the results from 13 years (from October 2007 to September 2020) of eddy covariance data and detailed crop production measurements to investigate changing climate and C allocation in a typical wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and maize (Zea mays L.) double cropping agroecosystem in the North China Plain. We found that the agroecosystem on average acted as a slight C sink, i.e., net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) is 36 g C m−2 yr−1) across the study period. Increased CO2 led to a rising trend of gross primary production (GPP, 72 g C m− 2 yr− 2), ∼35% of which led to increased NECB (the slope is 25 g C m−2 yr−2). However, concomitant increases in temperature and decreases in surface soil moisture caused higher partitioning of GPP to autotrophic respiration, leading to lower increases in net primary production and grain yield. Summer maize experienced a greater risk of C source increase, as well as greater grain yield reduction than winter wheat, most likely due to higher temperatures and drought in summer. Overall, our observational evidence suggests that current management and ongoing climate change increase the ability of the agroecosystem to increase NECB, but does not enhance crop production in this intensively managed high yield agroecosystems. However, C allocation strategies are unlikely to maintain constant in the future as multiple climate change factors act on the agroecosystem.

The study found that a 1% increase in CFBL is associated with a 0.15% increase in ecological footprint, whereas a 1% increase in TFFS is correlated with a 0.80% increase in ecological footprint. This suggests that fossil fuel subsidies have a larger detrimental impact on the ecological footprint compared to CFBL. The results provide evidence of an asymmetric relationship between CFBL, TFFS, and ecological footprints. Specifically, CFBL has a significant positive association with ecological footprint, with a 1% increase in CFBL associated with a 0.01% increase in ecological footprint, while a 1% decrease in CFBL results in a 0.002% increase in ecological footprint. TFFS has a more pronounced impact on ecological footprint, with a 1% increase associated with a 0.14% decrease and a 1% decrease associated with a 0.30% decrease, which is twice as large. The findings suggest that positive shocks in environmental taxation lead to a 0.54% decrease in ecological footprints, while negative shocks have a profoundly detrimental effect with a 1.33% increase in ecological footprints. Additionally, the interaction effect indicates that the effectiveness of CFBL and TFFS on ecological footprints is contingent on the level of environmental tax. The result shows that with a 1% increase in environmental tax, the negative impact of CFBL and TFFS on ecological footprints decreases by 0.02% and 0.09%, respectively. These findings underscore the importance of reducing carbon emissions and fossil fuel subsidies and implementing effective environmental taxation policies to promote sustainability and mitigate environmental damage.

However, the spatiotemporal changes in UCI intensity at the national scale have not been fully explored under rapid urbanization in China. In this study, based on 23,081 Landsat images from the Google Earth Engine, spatiotemporal UCI was obtained for 320 cities in China from 2000 to 2018 and correlated with meteorological and urbanization parameters to uncover the factors driving UCI changes. The direct and indirect effects of the driving factors on UCI were investigated using structural equation modeling. Our results showed that China experienced 12.38%, 181.23%, 83.6%, and 22.63% increases in population density, gross domestic product (GDP), the impervious surface, and leaf area index (LAI), respectively, between 2000 and 2018. Furthermore, we found more rapid urbanization in the temperate continental climate (TCC) zone than in the temperate monsoon climate (TMC) and subtropical monsoon climate (SMC) zones in China. The national averaged UCI was 2.47 °C, with the largest UCI recorded in small cities and TCC zones. From 2000 to 2018, over 70% of cities showed an increasing trend in UCI intensity, mainly concentrated in TMC and megacities. At the national scale, the increase in UCI was likely explained by a combination result of the intensified wind speed, decrease in urban areas, and enhanced LAI. We also identified that the driving mechanisms of UCI were very different in different climatic zones. In TCC, precipitation had a major impact on UCI intensity at a threshold of 78.92 mm. In TMC and SMC, in addition to temperature, urbanization factors significantly influenced UCI. The main factors in TMC were LAI, with a specific threshold of 1.15. These results deepen the understanding of UCI formation and provide new insights into the regional adaptation of urban vegetation to mitigate urban heat waves.

In this study, we attempted to characterize city-level spatial networks of GTFP by investigating China's major three coastal city clusters: Jing-Jin-Ji (JJJ), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), and Pearl River Delta (PRD). We estimated the GTFP of 38 cities within these three coastal city clusters by applying a super-efficiency slack-based measure (SBM) within a data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach, constructed a spatial network of GTFP for each city cluster based on gravity model, traced out the centralities and subgroups of each GTFP network by conducting social network analysis, and then investigated the socioeconomic factors correlating to GTFP interrelation between cities. The results are as follows: First, the average GTFP in the three clusters increased from 2010 to 2021, as did the industrial value added in these regions. In addition, average GTFP increased the most in PRD region relative to the other two clusters. Second, centers of the spatial network of GTFP exist in these three regions. These are as follows: Beijing, Tianjin, and Langfang in JJJ region; Wuxi, Suzhou, and Yangzhou in YRD region; and Guangzhou and Foshan in PRD region. In the JJJ and YRD regions, the composition of the subgroups containing cities with greater closeness of GTFP underwent significant changes between 2010 and 2021, whereas the composition of the subgroup in the PRD region did not change as much. Third, differences in terms of industrial structure and distance between two cities are key underlying factors that influence the interrelation of GTFP between these cities. The characteristics of the spatial networks of GTFP in the three city clusters imply that improving the balance between the central cities and other noncentral cities to alleviate the misallocations between cities and economic resources could result in an increase in the overall efficiency of economic growth and environmental improvement.";"2023-10-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262302749X";"10";"Emissions Other

Little is known about the spatial and temporal variability of soil organic carbon (SOC), future trends, and the driving forces of changes in each Mollisols region. The aim of this work is to trace the SOC dynamics during the 2000–2020 period and forecast its dynamics for 2020–2040 period (every 5 years) across the global Mollisols regions, highlighting the driving factors for these changes. We used bare soil images and environmental covariates to construct a robust prediction model of SOC using machine learning. The best model was used to forecast future changes in SOC content under different emission scenarios. Also, the role of different predictor variables in predicting and driving SOC changes is indicated with the help of the shapley value algorithm. Results show that SOC content in the current global Mollisols regions is 26.45 g kg−1 in Ukraine, 21.34 g kg−1 in Northeast China, 21.05 g kg−1 in the USA and 15.59 g kg−1 in Argentina. However, they have been decreasing since 2001 and showed a slowing trend, with the highest and lowest rates of 11.45% in Ukraine and 7.33% in the USA, respectively. The forecast under different climate scenarios shows a slight decrease in SOC content within a range of 0.46%–1.22%. Among them, SSP 245 is more consistent with the current trend of SOC content, while SSP585 indicates the greatest loss of SOC content.

Previous studies assess the TRAP exposure of commuters mainly based on fastest and lowest-dose routes. In addition, the first and last parts of the commutes (“first and last mile”) are often overlooked, wherein the commuters tend to choose active transport (walking, jogging and cycling) and are highly exposed to air pollution. This study uses a space syntax model to simulate the most likely actual commuting routes (behavior-based routes) of “first and last mile” in Changsha, China, and combine it with a land-use regression (LUR) model to assess the TRAP exposure. Furthermore, the air pollution exposure doses of commuters across the behavior-based routes are compared with those across the fastest and lowest-dose routes. The results indicate that only 5.9%–13% of lowest-dose routes do not overlap the fastest routes, and the differences in both average fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure are below 1%. However, up to 53.1%–68% of the behavior-based routes do not overlap with the fastest and lowest-dose routes, and the average accumulated exposure of the behavior-based routes exceeds those of the other routes by 7.8%–12.9%. These findings suggest an underestimation of TRAP exposure and the potential benefits of choosing cleaner routes. The results also indicate that commuters living in sub-central areas are linked with relatively larger commuting time costs and higher accumulated exposure doses. This highlights the need to focus on the environmental issues suffered by the commuters in these areas.

The mechanism of synergistic conversion between biomass, external moisture, and iron sand was described. The iron ore and moisture in the initial roasting stage reduced the tar yield, significantly retarded the escape of hydrocarbons, and prolonged the high-pressure maintenance time. Thereafter, the biomass tar and biomass carbon were gasified under the action of oxygen elements from external moisture and iron ore, eventually generating CO and H2 with the final residual carbon being 9.73% comparing to the initial total C element. The reducing gas generated from biomass was used to reduce iron ore, ensuring a high metallization of iron ore and achieving efficient synergistic conversion of biomass and iron ore. Moisture and lattice oxygen of iron ore play significant roles in the gasification of biomass at the early stage. The formed metallic iron and moisture further promoted the gasification of biomass C in the subsequent catalysis. This mutually reinforcing and transformative approach shows great potential in promoting biomass gasification efficiency and reducing carbon emissions from DRI processes.

In this case study we applied Holistic and Integrated Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment to a prospective technical concept for the production of biofuels from wood residues, sorghum and straw via gasification and Fischer-Tropsch synthesis located in the German federal state Brandenburg. Through this quantitative and qualitative sustainability assessment we identified synergies and hot-spots of biofuel production on a detailed and aggregated level, as well as compare the impacts to fossil fuels and other alternative transport systems. 99 social, ecological and economic indicator results addressing 14 out of 17 SDGs show contributions but also sustainability risks of such biofuels for the SDGs. The total substitution factor of impacts (f = 21.38) for all indicators of biofuels compared to fossil fuels indicates significantly higher impacts of biofuels production, in particular for land (SDG 15, f = 30.43), water (SDG 14, f = 125.57), consumption and production patterns (SDG 12, f = 54.11), low energy efficiency and maintaining problematic global supply chains and working conditions. However, the impacts on climate can be lower (SDG 13, f = 0.42), if residual heat is effectively and efficiently used. Comparing the transportation systems and use phases of fuels, all types of car-based individual transportation including fossil fuels (f = 6.50), biofuels (f = 9.16) and electric drive (f = 6.46) had significant higher impacts than transportation by train. Besides technological downsides, such as the high energy demand, biofuels may play a minor role for specific applications with no other alternative energy technologies in the future. In conclusion, it is very questionable whether such liquid biofuels are a suitable drop-in solution to substitute fossil fuels in a significant quantity. In a final discussion we referred to the necessary societal-ecological transformation with structural changes of production, consumption, political economy and global supply chains. In the future, Holistic and Integrated Life Cycle Sustainability Assessment will be further improved by closing indicator and database gaps, including a cost analysis and direct stakeholder participation, as well as absolute sustainability assessments on how much biofuel production is sustainable.";"2023-09-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623022047";"10";"Emissions Other

Investigating and studying whether and how it can aid in implementing energy transformation is worthwhile. This paper uses 30 provinces from 2004 to 2020 as research samples, the entropy method to construct a green finance measurement system, and the weighted multidimensional vector angle index method to construct an energy low-carbon transformation index based on the actual situation of green finance in China and the existing theoretical research basis. We systematically analyzed each province's spatiotemporal evolution characteristics of green finance and energy structure transformation by constructing a fixed effect model, a GMM model, an intermediary effect model, and a spatial Dubin model. We empirically tested the effect direction, internal mechanism, spatial spillover, and regional heterogeneity of green finance development (GFD) on energy structure transformation (EST) to investigate the low-carbon transformation of energy structures. The findings indicate the following:(1) Green finance plays a positive role in promoting the transformation and development of China's energy structure. (2) The influence of green finance development on the transformation of China's energy structure has significant spatial spillover, exhibiting “local and neighborhood” reciprocity. Through the spatial spillover effect, green finance can encourage the low-carbon transformation of local energy structures and increase the level of low-carbon transformation in neighboring areas. (3) The improvement of the level of green technology innovation and the intensity of environmental regulations are essential channels for green finance to support the low-carbon transformation of the energy structure, and regional heterogeneity will alter this transmission mechanism. The findings of this study provide empirical evidence for the vital role of green finance in achieving the double dividend of economic growth and low-carbon emission reduction. This study provides a new perspective for constructing a green finance system and advancing the dual-carbon objective and a resource for formulating effective regional energy transformation policies.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.137568";"A deep spatio-temporal learning network for continuous citywide air quality forecast based on dense monitoring data ";" As urban air pollution becomes a severe environmental and societal issue globally, there is an increasing need on making air quality forecasts to prevent health and capital loss. Currently, most of the studies only provide air pollution forecasts on single or multiple sites, rather than citywide information. Due to complex urban structure and spatial transportation of air pollutants, the distribution of citywide air quality can be highly varying, which makes it extremely challenging to make accurate forecasts. Here, we address this challenge by exploring the potential of combining the dense air quality monitoring data with the deep learning technique. By using the fine-granular PM2.5 concentrations data collected from 417 micro monitoring stations in Lanzhou City, China, we proposed an end-to-end method to predict future citywide PM2.5 concentrations at 500 m × 500 m × 1 h resolution. This method consists of a spatio-temporal transformation component and a spatio-temporal prediction component, of which the former is responsible for converting PM2.5 concentration data into spatial-maps, while the spatio-temporal prediction network (i.e., Air-PredNet in our study) based on ConvLSTM in the latter is responsible for capturing the spatio-temporal characterizations in the spatial-map sequences and finally generating citywide air quality forecasts. The results show that our method can accurately predict the spatial distribution and variations of PM2.5 concentration with an RMSE of 2.12 μg/m3 for 1-h prediction and an RMSE of 4.09 μg/m3 for 6-h prediction. In addition, we also proved the robustness of Air-PredNet based on the prediction performance for O3 and NO2. Our results demonstrate the potential and feasibility of dense monitoring data combined with advanced data science methods for citywide urban air quality forecast, which supports the urban atmospheric environment fine management and decision-making.

To fill this research gap, this study constructs a decomposition framework and multiple panel threshold regression models based on an extended STIRPAT model using panel data from 36 OECD countries to explore the nonlinear relationship between ECI and ecological footprint (an indicator of environmental quality) in terms of three key mediators: energy consumption structure, industrial structure, and human capital. The results show that a 1% increase in economic complexity is associated with a 0.075% increase in ecological footprint per capita, and an increase in economic complexity is detrimental to environmental improvement. When energy consumption structure is used as the threshold variable, the correlation coefficient between ECI and ecological footprint per capita gradually shifts from positive to negative with an inverted U-shaped curve as the share of renewable energy consumption increases. In particular, when the share of renewable energy consumption is higher than 44.56%, ECI shows a negative correlation with ecological footprint, i.e., ECI promotes the improvement of environmental quality. When the industrial structure is used as the threshold variable, the coefficient change from the below-threshold stage to the above-threshold stage indicates that the reduction of per capita ecological footprint shrinks from 0.161% to 0.102% for each 1% increase in ECI. The increase in the human capital index suppresses the positive effect of ECI on the ecological footprint per capita, i.e., the technology effect mitigates the environmental pressure caused by ECI, and only a country with a human capital index above 2.60 is in the interval where the technology effect comes into play. Finally, targeted policy recommendations from the perspective of the energy structure, industrial structure, and labor force are proposed to mitigate the effects of economic complexity on environmental quality.

The EU's farm-to-fork strategy (F2F) demands an agri-food value chain approach to reduce nutrient emissions by 50% and fertilizer use by 20%. Substance flow analysis (SFA) is a method that can be applied to study complex systems such as the agri-food chain. A review of 60 SFA studies shows that they often lack detail by not sufficiently distinguishing between nodes, products and types of emissions. The present study aims to assess the added value of detail in SFAs and to illustrate that valuable indicators can be derived from detailed assessments. This aim will be attained by presenting a highly-detailed SFA for the livestock-intensive region of Flanders, Belgium. The SFA distinguishes 40 nodes and 1827 flows that are classified into eight different categories (e.g. by-products, point source emissions) following life cycle methods. Eight novel indicators were calculated, including indicators that assess the N and P recovery potential. Flanders has a low overall nutrient use efficiency (11% N, 18% P). About 55% of the N and 56% of the P embedded in recoverable streams are reused providing 35% and 37% of the total N and P input. Optimized nutrient recycling could replace 45% of N and 48% of P of the external nutrient input, exceeding the target set by the F2F strategy. Detailed accounting for N and P flows and nodes leads to the identification of more recoverable streams and larger N and P flows. More detailed flow accounting is a prerequisite for the quantification of technological intervention options.

So these are frequently subjected to heavy air pollution, which has critical consequences for the health and production activities and well-being of local citizens. To curb the aggravation of air pollution, the Chinese government conducted an air pollution control action plan with unprecedented strength in September 2013. In this study, based on the fine-resolution aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, combined meteorological and other auxiliary data, utilizing information entropy, backward trajectory, source analysis, and multi-layer perceptron methods, we comprehensively analyzed the spatiotemporal characteristics and variations of AOD in typical arid and semi-arid areas megacities (Lanzhou and Urumqi) from 2010 to 2019, and further explore the potential pollution sources and nature and anthropic influences on AOD. The main results indicate that Lanzhou AOD remains higher than Urumqi in almost all different time windows, especially in the spring. Specifically, the AOD shows a single-peaked distributed trend on the monthly scale, but the peak occurred one month later in Lanzhou than in Urumqi. In the seasons, Lanzhou and Urumqi all show a trend that spring and winter AOD are higher than summer and fall. Lanzhou and Urumqi overall show a tortuous decreasing and then rebounded trend between 2010 and 2019, but the AOD variation in the Urumqi is more dramatic than in Lanzhou. The high AOD mainly concentrates in low altitude areas and there is a downward tendency of AOD in high-AOD areas, but an upward trend in low-AOD areas. The AOD intensity of change is higher in Lanzhou than in Urumqi, but Lanzhou has more concentration. The seasonal differences in backward trajectories are stronger in Lanzhou than in Urumqi, generally, Lanzhou's potential trajectory is mainly distributed in the Hexi Corridor, while Urumqi is along the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains urban cluster distribution. The potential source area of AOD has a significant seasonal variation, and the closer to the object, the greater the contribution. Generally, Lanzhou pollution is more sensitive to the atmosphere condition and has a wider source area than Urumqi. The AOD was influenced by a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors, but natural variables seem to be more dominant. The impact of natural factors in Urumqi and Lanzhou is statistically obtained up to 75.04% and 52.01% respectively.

Deep tillage (DT) can change soil properties and the input and loss of OC, and then influence SOC sequestration across the whole soil profile. However, the effect of DT on SOC sequestration relative to conventional tillage (CT) under different environmental factors and management practices is unclear in China. In this study, we evaluated the response of SOC stock to DT based on collected field data (447 observations) with a meta-analysis. DT significantly increased SOC stock by 7.36% over CT, with a greater increase for subsoiling (8.76%) than for deep ploughing (DP) (5.85%). Subsoiling enhanced SOC across the 0–40 cm soil layer and the greatest increase occurred at 0–10 cm layer (11.41%); DP enhanced SOC stock at 10–40 cm layer, but had no effect on SOC of 0–10 cm layer. DP and subsoiling did not affect SOC storage below 40 cm depth. According to subgroup analysis, the high rainfall, fine soil texture, residue retained, double cropping, and high rate of N fertilization greatly promoted SOC stock compared with the low rainfall, sandy texture, residue removal, monoculture, and low N fertilizer input under DT. DT significantly enhanced SOC storage under low initial SOC (<15 g kg−1), but did not affect SOC when the initial SOC exceeded 15 g kg−1 compared with CT.

The paper assesses the greenhouse gas mitigation potential and economic impact of electricity from major food crop residues subjected to anaerobic digestion technology in 16 regions and 88 districts in Ghana from 2017 to 2020. Buswell equation was applied to calculate the biogas and methane yield. The environmental impact assessment was expressed as global warming potential, and the economic feasibility was conducted. The results showed that crop residues' annual theoretical and technical potential was 28.92 Mt and 17.24 Mt. The top four residues with the largest share of technical potential were maize (5.41 Mt), yam (3.58 Mt), plantain (3.05 Mt) and cassava (2.39 Mt). Biogas and electricity potentials were 1,912.74 Mm3 and 3,068.34 GWh, which could offset 15.56% of electricity consumption in Ghana. The Ashanti (478.18 GWh), Eastern (430.20 GWh), Bono East (318.29 GWh) and Northern (314 GWh) regions demonstrated the highest electricity potential.

Although the impact of natural and land use factors on PM2.5 concentration has previously been quantified, in this paper we show that multiple environmental factors exhibit significant spatial heterogeneity at a range of scales. A more comprehensive analysis of PM2.5 variations require the potential effects of seasonal variations in meteorological conditions, interactions between natural and land use factors, and possible multi-scale spatial effects to be accounted for. Based on the global remote sensing inversion dataset, the aim of this study is to elucidate the spatially heterogeneous relationships of PM2.5 concentrations with natural and land use factors, and their multi–scale effects. This is achieved through combining geographical detector (GD), random forest (RF) and multiscale geographically weighted regression modelling (MGWR) to reveal the underlying mechanisms of spatial variation of PM2.5 concentrations in the Niger River Watershed (NRW). The results show that natural factors, represented by meteorological and topography variables, are most prominent. Human activities, represented by land use, have significant indirect effects through interactions with meteorological factors. Elevation (ELE) and annual minimum temperature (TMIN) emerge as the most important interaction centers among natural factors. In addition, the interaction between natural and land use factors are crucial in considering PM2.5 transmission and dispersion in the NRW. The topography and meteorological factors underlie the basic spatial pattern PM2.5 concentrations in the NRW, among which seasonal meteorological parameters have a more prominent impact on PM2.5 concentration. Both natural and land use factors exhibit strong non–stationarity in respect of spatial variations in PM2.5, and the effect of environmental factors in general on PM2.5 is scale–dependent. Transport and dispersion are important constraints in terms of aerosol loading regionally.

This study aims to quantify: i) the GHG footprint of WBPs produced in China, and ii) the influence of different methods to assess the delayed emission of biogenic carbon. Cradle-to-gate life cycle models are developed for plywood (PLY), fiberboard (FB), particleboard (PB) and oriented strand boards (OSB). Based on two common end-of-life (EoL) destinations (i.e., incineration and landfill), three approaches to the estimation of the delayed emissions of biogenic carbon in cradle-to-grave assessments are compared. The cradle-to-gate results show that the GHG footprints of PLY, FB, PB and OSB without considering biogenic carbon storage are 538 kg CO2 e/m³, 406 kg CO2 e/m³, 348 kg CO2 e/m³ and 552 kg CO2 e/m³, respectively. For the four types of WBPs, resources extraction stage provides the largest contribution to the GHG footprints (55%–81%), followed by the production process (18%–31%) and raw material transportation (1%–18%). The methodologies used to assess delayed emissions in cradle-to-grave WBP GHG footprint assessments play an important role, especially for incineration scenarios. Finally, emission reduction measures are proposed based on reducing the consumption of adhesives and of energy use in the production process.

The use of woody plants as construction materials could simultaneously address this challenge: CO2 is absorbed through photosynthesis, while wood-based products provide mitigation by replacing either petrochemical materials such as plastic boards or energy-intensive materials like bricks. This study combines, at the scale of France, static and dynamic life cycle assessment with soil carbon simulations to investigate the long-term environmental performance of using, as input for the building sector, black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) planted on “carbon vulnerable lands”. These are areas specifically selected for their low soil organic carbon (SOC) levels and low potential to interfere with food security. After the consecutive cultivation of three rotations, black locust was shown to stock an additional 92000 kg ha−1 of carbon in soils as SOC. The mitigation effect from the plastic board replacement is the major contributor to the assessed environmental impacts, including climate change, leading the black locust system to generally perform better than the reference system where the carbon vulnerable areas are left as they are with their initial vegetation. Considering that cultivation starts in 2022, the dynamic evaluation of the global mean temperature change (GMTC) shows that the black locust system results in net negative emissions in the near- and mid-term, but with a GMTC overshot in the second half of the century. Even if a considerable carbon stock is created through time (e.g., 81% and 39% of the carbon captured by photosynthesis, in 2050 and 2100 respectively), the GHG emissions stemming from manufacturing and end-of-life processes were shown to offset the benefit of carbon capture.

Here, we developed an analytical framework for trade-embodied pollutant emissions transfer (TPET) network by combining complex network theory and input– output theory to analyze the network of 16 light industries in 43 economies from 2000 to 2014. We revealed the critical economies, key industries, critical paths and their evolution trends. The light industry sector's total TPET was consistently large, but many factors (e.g., upgrading consumer goods, increasing trade volume, the 2008 financial crisis) caused large fluctuations. The network densities remained relatively high, with an obvious small-world property and significant centralization. Large economies (especially the world's top 10 economies with a total GDP exceeding US $1.86 trillion in 2014) were critical nodes due to their stable and dominant importance, but played opposite roles (i.e., net TPET importers vs. net exporters). Due to large differences in domestic demand, and environmental regulations, high-income economies (e.g., the U.S., and Germany) were the leading net TPET exporters, whereas low- or middle-income economies (e.g., China, Russia) were the dominate net importers; TPET therefore primarily flowed from high-income to low- or middle-income economies, with substantial growth over time. The electricity, gas, steam and air conditioning supply industry, the manufacture of other non-metallic mineral products, the manufacture of basic metals, and the fishing and aquaculture industry together accounted for 81.2 and 89.0% of total trade-embodied NOX and SOX emissions, respectively; they were thus key industries. To reduce emissions, critical economies should consume more environment-friendly products, strengthen technological innovation and pollution control in key industries, and expand environmental cooperation with other countries. Our results provide insights into the global light industry sector's TPET characteristics and reduction strategies. They also provide a reference for adjusting trade patterns and industrial structures. ";"2023-01-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622051332";"13";"Emissions Other

This study constructed experimental microcosm systems to explore the release-migration rules and reveal the potential influencing mechanisms of Phe from paddy soil to overlying water under bioturbation in an RF coculture agroecosystem in this area. (1). The release of particulate Phe (P-Phe) and dissolved Phe (D-Phe) was significantly promoted by bioturbation (p<0.05). The results of Pearson correlation analysis revealed strong correlations between P-Phe and total suspended solids (TSS), D-Phe and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (p<0.05). (2). The adsorption process of Phe at the paddy soil-overlying water interface conformed to the competitive adsorption-solubilization (CAS) model of large-molecule biological dissolved organic matter (Bio-DOM) at low concentrations (7 mg/L) (L-C Bio-DOM -LM-CAS) and the coadsorption and accumulation model of small-molecule Bio-DOM at high concentrations (45 mg/L) (H-C Bio-DOM -SM-CAA). (3). Ultraviolet fluorescence (UV-FS) tracing technology and reaction diffusion modeling were used to qualitatively and quantitatively simulate the migration pathway of Phe-containing paddy soil particles. The maximum fluorescent particle (f-ps) concentration of Phe migration in paddy soil was 8.23%, and the maximum bioturbation diffusion coefficient ( D b ) was 23.6 × 10−3 cm2/d. Bioturbation significantly altered the physicochemical properties of paddy soil (p<0.05). The results of principal component analysis (PCA) showed that particle size (<0.05 mm) is the key factor causing the Phe maximum migration concentration to be 68.39 ng/g in paddy soil.

Reports on behavior of fiberglass particles in this leaching pulp are rare. In this study, using clean fiberglass powder in amine leach solutions of waste printed circuit board of different concentrations, copper and zinc concentrations changes were monitored over time to confirm metal losses to the particles. The interaction was studied against various adsorption isotherm and kinetic models. Of the seven non-linear adsorption isotherm models employed, Sips adsorption isotherm model best fitted the experimental data with R2 of 0.9999 for Cu and 0.9848 for zinc. For the five non-linear adsorption kinetic models studied, Avrami model fitted the experimental data best with R2 of 0.9617 and 0.9503 for copper and zinc, respectively.

CMAP promoted decomposition of oxygenated and Br/N-containing compounds in char, producing char with stronger aromatization and graphitization. CMAP facilitated bromine fixation in char, with higher bromine yield in solid product and lower bromine yield in condensate (71.69 and 18.80 wt %, respectively) than BMAP (67.51 and 29.11 wt %, respectively). For catalytic CMAP, continuous mixing promoted heat exchange between WPCBs and hot K2CO3 particles thus providing a higher heating rate, which led to a higher condensate yield than BMAP. K2CO3 promoted >95% of bromine retained in char during both processes. The higher KBr content in char, and lower concentrations of Br-containing compounds in pyrolysis oil and lower HBr yield were achieved from catalytic CMAP compared to BMAP, mainly due to more uniformly mixing of solid and volatiles in CMAP process. CMAP had more supremacy than BMAP in significantly enhancing energy efficiency.

Deep eutectic solvents (DESs) are environmentally friendly and non-aqueous lixiviants that can leach metal oxides to replace mineral acids. In this study, three choline chloride (ChCl)-based DESs were synthesized, using ethylene glycol, oxalic acid (OA), and glycolic acid (GA) as the hydrogen bond donors in the eutectic mixtures. The time-dependent leaching yields and saturated loading capacities of the DESs to typical metal oxides and Ag were evaluated. Considering the leaching performances, a simple and environmentally friendly method for metal recovery from WPCBs was established, based on two-stage DES leaching processes. The research object was the mixed metal powder collected from the mechanical processing of WPCBs. The results indicated that 90.35% of Zn, 87.47% of Pb, and 16.77% of Cu were removed from the mixed metal powder after calcination by leaching of the ChCl-GA DES and precipitation of the oxalic acid solution. When the residue was subjected to ChCl-OA DES leaching, Cu was recovered by diluting ChCl-OA DES with water. Specifically, 74.93% of Cu was separated in the form of CuC2O4·2H2O with a purity of >98 wt%.

With the number of mobile phone devices operating worldwide expected to reach 18bn by 2025, their low recycling rate leads to high tonnages of waste printed circuit boards (WPCBs) at their end of life. Copper, representing 58% of the total metal content in an end-of-life mobile phone (EoL-MP) and the main metal present in the printed circuit board, with an average of 27.8 wt %, offers a resource-rich source of this strategic metal for recovery. To overcome the limitations associated with conventional technologies for recycling WPCBs, use of greener technologies (ionic liquids (ILs) as leaching agents), offers greater potential for the recovery of copper from this waste stream. Presented here for the first time is an optimised hydrometallurgical process for recovery of copper involving pre-treatment, leaching, and electrowinning and the use of two task-specific ionic liquids. The pre-treatment step, using the IL [Bmim]BF4 proved to be a clean, efficient, and non-polluting system for the separation of solder and electronic components (ECs) from WPCBs, at 210 °C, 150 rpm for 15 min, favouring the enrichment of copper for a subsequent recovery process. The IL, [Bmim]HSO4, successfully leaches >99% of copper from pretreated WPCBs under the optimal conditions of 30 %v/v [Bmim]HSO4, 10 %v/v H2O2, and 60 %v/v H2O at 60 °C, 1:15 solid to liquid ratio for 2 h. Recovery of copper is achieved through direct electrowinning from the [Bmim]HSO4-leach solution, as electrolyte. Under controlled deposition conditions of 100 mA (4.2 V) during 2 h, 100% of copper (>99% purity) is recovered with an average current efficiency of 78% and an energy consumption of 4.5 kWh/kg Cu. This work combines a dual leaching and electrowinning system that is clean, environmentally friendly, minimises reagent use and spent wastes, permits multiple reuses of both the ILs, and maximises resource conservation through recovery of copper metal and return of secondary streams (electronic components and solder) for reuse in new or refurbished components or products.";"2023-09-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623025374";"19";"Printed Circuit Boards"

With the number of these devices operating worldwide expected to reach 18bn by 2025 their low recycling rate leads to large tonnages of End-of-Life Mobile Phones (EoL-MPs) and de facto a challenging waste stream. The rapid replacement of mobile phones to meet consumer demand further compounds the challenges due to increased demand for raw materials, increased energy, and water consumption, and, where uncontrolled and poor disposal at end-of-life occurs, significant impacts on health and the environment. EoL-MPs comprise a complex and heterogeneous combination of materials that include strategically and economically important high technology metals, many of which are classified as critical by the EU. A detailed characterisation of key components (PCBs, casings, screens, cameras, and speakers) of multigenerational (feature phones, multimedia phones, and smartphones) EoL-MPs is studied to determine the potential for recovery of both metal and non-metallic fractions and the economic drivers for recovery of the metal value. On average, the major mass fraction distributed in a mobile phone is: plastics (40%), metals (35%) and ceramics (25%). The results show that 1 tonne of EoL-MPs can contain up to 53 Kg copper, 141 g gold, 270 g silver, 10 g platinum, 18 g palladium and 3.3 Kg rare earth elements, among other valuable metals, with many of these elements found to be at least twice, and in some cases, up to 600 times more concentrated than in their natural ores. The calculated economic value of the EoL-MPs components is in the order: cameras (86,860 US$/ton), printed circuit boards (55,459 US$/ton), speakers (21,853 US$/ton) and screens (3,779 US$/ton). Based on the predicted 5 billion EoL-MPs discarded by the end of 2022, this waste stream has a potential economic value of US$ 9.25 billion. Use of EoL-MPs as a secondary resource-rich stream of these critical materials therefore offers a route to close the materials loop, helps to mitigate the threat to natural resources and the environmental and human health impacts arising from mining operations, relieves supply demands and contributes to the economy.";"2023-09-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623022576";"26";"Printed Circuit Boards"

Recycling is one of the environment-friendly waste management strategies that creates a net environmental gain in recovering valuable materials. In some countries, downstream recycling (high-value material recovery) is done overseas, and Australia is one of them. Waste printed circuit board (PCB) is a critical component of various electronic equipment, and it contains metals such as copper, tin, gold, aluminium, iron, silver, and others. Waste PCB, as apart of e-waste is mainly recycled overseas in Australia. However, the overall environmental impacts of recycling the waste stream overseas have yet to be investigated. The benefits of recovering the material in Australia have yet to be extensively understood from a supply chain perspective. This study aims to develop multiple scenarios using lifecycle assessment (LCA) methodology to identify the best possible solution for waste PCB disposal (final sink) derived from e-waste. Using SimaPro and Ecoinvent databases, four scenarios have been developed, along with a baseline scenario where waste PCB is recycled overseas. Receipe 2016 impact assessment methodology was utilized for the analysis, and results of the study showed that Scenario 2 (integrated material and energy recovery) is the best approach for waste PCB recycling in Australia, while landfill and direct incineration were the identified two worst scenarios in terms of final disposal option. When choosing local recycling over overseas recycling of waste PCB (material recovery only), it was found that impact categories such as global warming (human health) and fossil resource scarcity were reduced by 53% and 98%, respectively. In addition, the net positive environmental gain could be achieved for human non-carcinogenic toxicity by 7.16% when the waste stream is recycled in Australia. Uncertainty analysis of the study showed that in almost all major impact categories, material and energy recovery together scored high compared to scenarios when only material recovery was considered. This study is the first systematic attempt to characterize system-level lifecycle environmental impact assessment for waste PCB recycling. Future policies and regulations should focus on data transparency and availability across the value chain, local infrastructure development, and resource circularity.

However, the electrolyte that remains after slurry electrolysis contains high concentrations of metal, which can cause pollution without suitable treatment. Most importantly, the metals in the electrolyte are not completely recovered, resulting in wasted resources and increased costs. Here, the feasibility of circulating this electrolyte and its effect on copper recovery, current efficiency, and purity, is discussed. We also describe in detail the migration and transformation of copper and other metals, such as nickel, zinc, and lead, during the preparation of high-purity cathode copper from mobile phone WPCBs (WPCB-MPs) using an ammonia-ammonium chloride slurry electrolysis system. Experimental results from 19 cycles of electrolyte reuse show that copper is mainly distributed in the cathode products, whereas other metals are mainly distributed in the electrolyte and anode residues. With an increase in the number of cycles, the concentration of other metals in the electrolyte gradually increased, showing metal enrichment. The current efficiency fluctuates but is usually >90%.

This paper presents a dual deep reinforcement learning agents-based (DDRLA) integrated order acceptance and scheduling (IOAS) for improving revenue. Firstly, a deep reinforcement learning-based virtual production scheduling (VPS) agent together with 8 state features and 11 action rules is designed. The VPS agent quickly and virtually reschedules a dynamically-arriving accepted order to evaluate the overall impact of accepting this order, including consumed capacity and increased revenue. Then, a deep reinforcement learning-based order acceptance decision (OAD) agent is designed. Based on the information guidance resulting from an interaction with the VPS agent, the OAD agent selectively accepts orders to maximize long-term gains, as well as to improve system resilience in the presence of a high ratio of urgent orders. The experiment results show that the proposed DDRLA method has better performance, compared with other IOAS approaches.

With a growing tendency to develop new Rs in CE frameworks, OEMs can become disoriented. While remanufacturing is often ranked low compared to other Rs, remanufacturing can still retain the highest product value (pull the used product value up to the top of the Retained Value Hill (see graphical abstract)).The aim of this paper is to align remanufacturing in comparison to other value-retaining processes (VRPs) in terms of the retained product value. To fulfill this aim, data was collected through a literature study and interviews with remanufacturers. The results show that although remanufacturing tends to demand more resources to retain a high product value, it outperforms other VRPs and delivers better output quality, assured with a longer warranty, neutral product identity, and extended (doubled or tripled) product use time. This paper enriches the research on remanufacturing, VRPs, and CE frameworks by showing that OEMs can ride the Retained Value Hill highest and longest only with remanufacturing.";"2023-10-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623028822";"12";"Printed Circuit Boards"

To address these problems and promote reuse and assembly efficiency, this paper presents a novel approach to fine-grained process retrieval and reuse, based on the process constituent elements model. The study highlights the importance of analyzing process information in four dimensions: input, auxiliary activities, value-added control activities, and output of process constituent elements. Additionally, a method for representing process multi-source information based on genetic structure is proposed. To measure similarity, the paper examines the base attributes of process constituent elements across different procedures and implements the grey relational analysis to integrate diverse information.

The integration of self-powered smart wearables enables continuous power supply for long-term operation of outdoor civilian and military electronics, especially in situations with limited access to conventional power sources. Resonant energy harvesting schemes working at the dominant frequencies of human movement can trigger large mechanical oscillations and significantly enhance the generation of electrical power. This study presents the development of a nonlinear two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) resonant energy harvesting system with a maximum power point tracking (MPPT) algorithm that adapts to individual human differences and stochastic motion patterns. Through an analysis of the system characteristics based on equivalent circuit modeling, it is found that the electrical damping of the harvester plays a crucial role in determining the actual power output, and the relationship between its optimal value and the oscillation frequency is unique. Thereby, an energy harvesting circuit with an adaptive MPPT algorithm is developed to optimize the electrical damping in real time by applying a novel Perturb and Observe technique based on the average power over each time period. In addition, a variable-step search method and a special convergence judgment are proposed to enhance the tracking speed. The sensitivity analysis of algorithm parameters indicates that the time period and power tolerance need to be reasonably selected to strike a balance between search speed and accuracy. The results of constant motion pattern tests show that the proposed algorithm with a variable-step search method exhibits superior search speed and accuracy over fixed-step configurations. The results of variable motion pattern tests reveal an increase in the actual system power output of up to 194% compared to the conventional fractional open-circuit voltage (FOCV) algorithm. Finally, the system adaptability test is conducted to validate the MPPT efficiency in four resonant systems. The results showcase an impressive MPPT efficiency of 93%–99%, demonstrating its reliability and robustness in various application scenarios.

It aims at considering the user's value proposition for Smart PSS in the dimensions of intelligence, sustainability, and society, while also ranking Smart PSS to support delivery risk management under uncertainty. However, related Smart PSS evaluation models advocate the use of multi-criteria decision models for obtaining the intrinsic value of PSS by ignoring the influence of the causality of criteria on Smart PSS design, which results in an unstable evaluation process. Additionally, the adaptiveness of Smart PSS has not been thoroughly explored, and determining the adoption intentions of Smart PSS can be challenging. To fill these gaps, a Smart PSS evaluation model that integrates a rough decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and a Bayesian network (BN) is proposed to support probabilistic reasoning for Smart PSS adaptiveness and reduce the risk of Smart PSS development. First, a set of 17 evaluation criteria is identified, and their causal relationships and weights of the criteria were identified using a rough DEMATEL under uncertainty. Second, a BN-based reasoning model for Smart PSS criteria is developed to evaluate the adaptability of smart PSS by constructing a conditional probability calculation model based on criterion weights.

The ascending and descending parts of triangular and trapezoidal membership functions (MFs) are straight lines. Therefore, if the value of a member increases by the same values, its membership degrees in ascending (descending) part increase (decrease) equally. These MFs do not necessarily reflect the experts' preferences. Consider two different cases; in the first one, the product quality of supplier A compared to supplier B increases from 2 to 3 times, and in the second case, this quality increases from 8 to 9 times. Triangular and trapezoidal membership degrees in both cases increase equally. However, the quality advantage of supplier A increases by 50% in the first case, while it increases by 12.5% in the second case. Therefore, the experts’ preferences may increase differently for these cases that cannot be reflected accurately by triangular and trapezoidal MFs. To overcome this flaw, we develop four FAHP methods for pentagonal FNs (PFNs). We also use an indirect method to defuzzify the fuzzy local weights. Indirect defuzzification is a simple method equivalent to the center of gravity (COG) method and needs low computations. Numerical examples are used to illustrate the proposed methods. A real example of ranking suppliers in a sustainable framework based on pentagonal fuzzy preferences is also presented.

The desmearing process was to drive the abrasive particles into the blind hole by pressurized air, and realized the cleaning of drilling dirt through collision. By comparing the cleaning effect, the process parameters (jet pressure, jet time, jet angle and jet distance) of sodium bicarbonate abrasive jet desmearing method were optimized, and the optimal process parameters were determined as 0.3 MPa, 10 s, 90° and 1 cm.

Moreover, the defects of the traditional extraction process, such as extractant ageing quickly, difficulty to back-extraction, and easy emulsification, seriously restricted the efficient and environmentally friendly recovery of In. Therefore, a novel adsorbent (D2EHPA/SiO2–P) was synthesized for the separation and recovery of In(III), and a new recovery process was developed to eliminate the defects of traditional In recovery process in this study. D2EHPA/SiO2–P exhibited excellent adsorption selectivity and kinetics for In(III), and the adsorption equilibrium was obtained within 3 min. The adsorption process of In(III) conformed to the pseudo-second-order and Langmuir model. In(III) on D2EHPA/SiO2–P was desorbed by 3 M HCl solution, and D2EHPA/SiO2–P still had high adsorption and desorption efficiency for In(III) after 5 times of adsorption-desorption cycle experiments. The adsorption mechanism study found that the O–H bond on the D2EHPA participated in the substitution reaction and bonded with In(III) as the adsorption site during the adsorption process.

Then, by assessing the user acceptance criteria for each specific application category, unsuitable applications were filtered out from the study. Only those application categories with achievable user acceptance criteria were preselected as promising applications for printed electronics. The final evaluation step considered the technical and sustainability advantages of replacing PCBs with printed electronics in the specific products within the preselected application categories.

Prussian blue analogues (PBAs) serving as distinctive Metal-organic frameworks, feature a multi-electron, multi-core structure, as well as exceptional properties like structural stability and compositional adjustability. These attributes endow them with significant promise in the realm of photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. In this work, the six kinds of common transition metal salts were employed in synthesizing Prussian blue analogues (Cd–Co PBAs, Cu–Co PBAs, Co–Co PBAs, Ni–Co PBAs, Zn–Co PBAs and In–Co PBAs) featuring varying metal compositions through the chemical co-precipitation method. A comprehensive analysis was subsequently carried out to explore the connection between their structural features and properties. The six kinds of Prussian blue analogues were directly used as catalysts to evaluate their performance in photocatalytic hydrogen evolution, accompanied by a thorough investigation into the impact of their structural variations on their ability to facilitate photocatalytic hydrogen evolution. Among them, Ni–Co PBAs has the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate (6197.4 μmol h−1 g−1) and the highest apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 5.75 % at 475 nm due to the suitable band gap structure and the ideal MII/MIII atomic ratio (3:2). When explaining the correlation between electronic structure and properties of PBAs, the density functional theory (DFT) calculation gives further insight. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the structure and properties of PBAs, which will provide a sustainable strategy for the development of photocatalysts based on PBAs for achieving high conversion efficiency of solar energy into hydrogen energy.

To facilitate the EET efficacy, herein, MoS2 nanosheets decorated with metallic Mo are rational designed to grow vertically and uniformly on carbon cloth (CC). This not only avoids the use of bonding agents, but also compensates for the inherent defects of MoS2 semiconductors, displaying an extremely low charge-transfer impedance of 4.6 Ω and a remarkable specific area capacitance of 435.97 F/m2. As expected, MFC equipped with Mo/MoS2-CC anode was faster started up for 1.35 d, achieving a superior power density of 3.25 W/m2 (8.15 d, 1.96 W/m2, CC), which is attributed to the continuous modification of CC surface properties via Mo/MoS2 nanosheets, boosting the electroactive bacterial attachment and EET process. Most importantly, the enhanced current intensity of Mo/MoS2-CC anode provides more robust and sustained electron for the cathodic Cr(Ⅵ) reduction, acquiring about 100% removal of Cr(Ⅵ) at the initial Cr(Ⅵ) concentration of 40 mg/L (75.5%, CC).

To address this issue, we constructed a coupled thermal-electrical-stress multi-physical field model of STEG, and optimized the STEG structure under the condition of allowed stress. The results show that when the allowed stress is not considered, the optimal ratio of cross-sectional ratio (f) to height (h) is 0.03 mm−1 to maximize the thermoelectric conversion efficiency, but then the maximum thermal stress of the STEG far exceeds the allowed stress of the material. When the allowed stress conditions are considered, the critical cross-sectional ratio of the module is much higher than the optimal cross-sectional ratio. The critical output power that can be obtained from the module is 38.5% less than the maximum output power without considering the allowed stress, and the influence of thermal stress on the optimal structural parameters is significant at a high concentration ratio. The critical output power gradually increases with the increase in the concentration ratio, and a greater output performance can be obtained at larger heights, while a greater output power density can be obtained at smaller heights.

To this end, this study aims to introduce an agent-based simulation (ABS) framework integrated with polynomial regression and ridge regression. In particular, two agent types are devised, as follow: (1) The photovoltaic agent calculates electricity produced via PV modules, and estimates its profits; and (2) the crop production agent calculates crop harvests underneath the PV modules, and estimates their profits.

Their excellent stability in strongly acidic, alkaline, and oxidizing etching solutions such as Tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH), perchloric acid/ceric ammonium nitrate aqueous solution (chrome), ammonium hydrogen fluoride solution, or buffered oxide etchant (BOE) and a mixture of phosphoric, acetic, and nitric acid etchant (PAN), has warranted their continuous use as a surfactant. The toxicity and extremely high persistence of PFAS necessitate their replacement with less toxic and effective alternative surfactants. A generic methodology is described for the identification of safer alternative surfactants and the experimental validation of properties to facilitate the drop-in replacement of these safer surfactants in etching solutions for the semiconductor industry. Hydrophilic-Lipophilic Balance (HLB) values, critical micelle concentration (CMC), compatibility, and wetting characteristics of etchants were analyzed on substrates relevant to the semiconductor industry. Biobased BG10 alternative surfactant outperformed PFAS surfactant in improving the wetting characteristics of the TMAH etchant on substrates of interest as evidenced by the significantly lower contact angle. The wetting characteristics of the PAN and BOE etchants containing BG10 and CG50 surfactants were comparable to PFAS surfactants. Toxicity comparisons indicated that these alternatives are far less hazardous to human health than PFAS. These safer alternatives have been tested successfully by over 100 semiconductor companies. These companies have provided positive feedback with no reported deleterious effects on the final products. This successful approach opens new possibilities for the replacement of PFAS in numerous other applications where PFAS is commonly used as a surfactant. Using this methodology, alkyl polyglucosides with trade names BG10 and CG50 and polyoxyethylene surfactants of Brij35 and BrijS100 were identified as alternatives to PFAS surfactants.

In which a solid absorption glass along with liquid filter is used as the combined volumetric filter for the silicon CPV module. However, the entire photovoltaic/photothermal conversion process in the combined filtered CPV/T system is complicated. To achieve more accurate predicted performance, a three-dimensional numerical model of this system is presented and the combined Monte Carlo Ray-Tracing (MCRT) method with the Finite Volume Method (FVM) is employed. The stated optical models are validated against the experimental results from an indoor test under one sun. And the coupled method of MCRT and FVM is also verified. The optimal filter combination is obtained by optical simulation using LightTools software based on the MCRT method firstly. Then, the solar energy flux distribution on the receiver achieved from LightTools is adopted as a boundary condition for CFD simulation. Based on these models and the MCRT-FVM coupled method, parametric study is conducted to quantify optical efficiency, temperature distribution, energy and exergy efficiency of the system. The results show that the optimal combined filters for silicon PV module are HB700+water and HB700+propylene glycol (PG). Because the optical absorption of water differs from that of PG, the PV maximum temperature is 308.36 K using HB700+water and it is 321.94 K using HB700+PG, whereas the outlet temperature of water and PG exceeds 352 K. The greater thermal and total exergy efficiencies can be achieved at higher inlet temperature and lower mass flow rate, while the electrical exergy efficiency shows slight change. To further reduce heat loss, an indium tin oxide (ITO) coating with low emissivity is applied on the receiver surface. The results reveal the receiver with 240° ITO coating achieves the highest total exergy efficiency of 14.92% and optical efficiency of 88.94%.

Replacing the organic dyes with inorganic phases poses a significant challenge. Without organic dyes, efficiency decreases dramatically due to loss of charge transfer. Thus, surface modification techniques are widely considered to be the key to reducing the electron recombination, suppressing the dark currents and increasing efficiency of DSSC. Using multiple absorbent materials with different energy gaps/band gap values could broaden the DSSC's photon absorption range. This study investigated the potential applications of transition metal sulfides (TMS), kesterite (Cu2ZnSnS4, CZTS) as a promising inorganic absorber layer of DSSCs. Based on the current-voltage measurement, a lower molar ratio of milled CZTS compared to the N719-dye produced a stable DSSC with a power conversion efficiency (η), short-circuit current density (J sc), and open-circuit voltage (V oc) of 4.75%, 13.99 mA cm−2, and 0.75 V, respectively. Furthermore, incident photon-to-current efficiency (IPCE) analysis exhibited an improved number of incident photons harvested by standard DSSC from 60% to 85% with and without the presence of CZTS. Even when light harvesting reached up to 80%, a higher concentration of CZTS content compared to the N719 dye produced an unstable solar cell device with a low J sc and η due to electron loss through the recombination process. This was confirmed by the recombination resistance (R rec) determined by the impedance spectroscopy (EIS), which found that the suppression of the Rrec at a lower ratio concentration between CZTS/N719-dye generated the highest η. The results that the use of the closest concentration of inorganic and organic co-sensitizers can improve the stability and overall performance of the developed DSSC.

Given this, innovative strategies of activating the passivation layers of Fe0 into semiconductors by photocatalysis and constructing S-scheme nanoflower heterojunctions with MoS2 (Fe0@MoS2) were fabricated. The results revealed that Fe0@MoS2 exhibited enhanced efficiency toward visible-light degradation of tetracycline, which was 3.20 and 1.27 times as high as that of bare MoS2 and Fe0, respectively.

Within green attitude-intention-behavior research, the intention-behavior discord debate is under-researched. Limited research focuses on bridging this intention-behavior gap using consumers' intrapsychic traits (consumers' self-driven traits of psyche or personality). Using a dual-theory perspective, this study analyses whether implementation intentions and self-efficacy types can motivate green consumers to initiate their green actions. The proposed hypotheses are empirically validated using 674 green consumers using a structured questionnaire survey method. Further, Anchoring Vignettes Mechanism has been employed to improve data reliability and ward-off biases in survey measurement. The study decodes that when consumers are provided with cues for implementation intentions and self-efficacy, the combined effect results in motivating consumers toward green action initiation.

Existing Tl extraction methods consume excessive Zn and often result in incomplete removal. This research introduces an optimized technique that incorporates lead(II) (Pb(II)) to form a Pb–Tl compound during Zn cementation. An initial thermodynamic analysis of Tl–Pb–Zn–H2O system reveals challenges in fully substituting Tl using just Zn powder due to minimal potential differences. However, with Pb(II) integration, this potential difference can be boosted to 312 mV. Experimental findings demonstrate that using solely Zn powder, even at 50 times the theoretical quantity, achieved a Tl extraction efficiency of only 50.32%. By adjusting the ratio of Pb(II) to Tl(I) to 1:1, this efficiency soared to 98.93%, while the required Zn powder amount was reduced by 20 times. Using Back Scanning Electron Microscopy (BSEM), deposits of Tl and Pb on Zn powder were confirmed, with elemental distributions perfectly aligned. Tests on ZnSO4 solutions with a Zn2+ ion concentration of 60 g/L still resulted in a 94.07% Tl extraction rate. When applied to actual ZnSO4 electrolytes from a Zn smelting process, the extraction rate remained high at 92.02%. Overall, this research underlines the superior Tl extraction capability of Pb(II) enhanced method over conventional procedures.

Digital technologies play a key role in overcoming the complexity that currently characterises - and at the same time limits - the successful large-scale implementation of remanufacturing activities. However, they can also engender new shortcomings in the implementation of remanufacturing activities, whose effects are not unidirectional or unambiguous. In this study, we explore how digital technologies can help overcome the shortcomings that prevent the scalability of remanufacturing activities in mature and complex industries which produce highly polluting waste. We conducted a longitudinal case study on the implementation of a white goods remanufacturing project that was launched in 2016 by a leading European distributor of spare parts for household appliances. Our results show that data centralisation – which creates efficiency at a local scale – does not guarantee the replicability of decision-making processes at a large scale; in fact, the opposite occurs. The study contributes to the circular economy and remanufacturing literature by unveiling the idiosyncratic shortcomings that are triggered by digitalisation, which limit the replicability of remanufacturing activities, and by proposing a decision-making tool that exploits platform logics in order to scale remanufacturing activities in mature and complex industries that produce highly polluting waste.";"2023-09-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623022369";"4";"Waste Other"

However, the development is hindered by the slow charging/discharging rates of the low thermal conductivity PCMs. Meanwhile, the high value-added utilization of waste plastic is receiving increasing attention as an environmentally sustainable strategy. In this regard, waste polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is recovered as SiC skeletons to obtain green phase change composites (PCCs) for waste heat recovery.

With the elevated thermal conductivity and spectral absorptance, proposed PCCs exhibit superior solar-thermal energy storage rates. Furthermore, numerical simulation of the thermal charging/discharging performance and flow characteristics is carried out for the packed bed TES system.

During manufacturing and use, amounts of waste NBR/PVC materials are produced. However, traditional methods of reusing waste are inappropriate. Herein, we innovatively proposed the utilization of mechanochemistry to induce the conversion of irreversible C–S cross-linked bonds in waste NBR/PVC insulation materials into dynamically reversible vitrimer-like network structures. The vitrimer-like structure endowed mobility to the global molecular chains in NBR/PVC materials.

Here, the degradation mechanism of PE oligomer (tetramer) by P450 BM3 variant was systematically explored with the aid of molecular dynamics simulations and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations. We found that the degradation includes two processes: hydrogen abstraction and rebound. The hydrogen abstraction process was determined as the rate-determining step with the Boltzmann-weight average energy barrier of 14.0 kcal/mol, which generally aligns with the experimental available kinetic data (turnover rate: 3020 min−1). Regio- and stereoselectivity during the degradation process were also revealed. Correlations between 38 key features and energy barriers were screened and key structural parameters that have strong influence on PE degradation efficiency were identified. The degradation process of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) oligomer also includes hydrogen abstraction and rebound step, while the catalytic energy landscape of rebound step is different from PE oligomer.

In order to explore the migration behavior of impurities in PG under electrokinetic treatment and provide a new treatment technology for the purification and harmless treatment, this paper studied the distribution of soluble impurities (PO4 3−, F−, Sr, Pb, Cr, Cu, and Mn) in PG under different electrokinetic treatment conditions. The results indicated that most of water-soluble impurities demonstrated obvious migration distribution laws at different voltages. Under the influence of electroosmotic flow, F− accumulated continually at the cathode. Positive MF+ was produced in acidic circumstances by combining F− and metal ions and travelled to the cathode under the combined action of electric field force and electroosmotic flow. Under electrokinetic treatment, the concentration of PO4 3− in the anode chamber increased while that of in the cathode chamber decreased. A large number of anions in PG were attached to the anode by coulomb force, reducing the potential. PO4 3− was s largely enriched in the anode chamber, which is controlled by the free diffusion effect of ions. Heavy metals exhibited higher leaching efficiency under anodic acid conditions. With the increase of applied voltage, the concentration of heavy metals in the anode chamber gradually increased, which was related to the activity of solution, pH and other factors.

Therefore, it is necessary to find ways of limiting the impact from food production and the food supply chain. Many crops are not adapted to growing in regions with cold climate, which creates the need to either import them or to use production methods such as greenhouses to artificially create good conditions for the crops. Sweden is currently reliant on imports for many different crops, including tomatoes where most of the consumption is covered by import from the Netherlands. This study uses life cycle assessment to analyze the potential environmental impact of Swedish tomato consumption, by comparing several year-round domestic production scenarios with scenarios representing import from the Netherlands. This is done by using a greenhouse simulation software to simulate a theoretical greenhouse placed in both countries, and then using the simulation results in combination with data from the database EcoInvent to perform a life cycle assessment. The results showed that Swedish domestic production has the potential to decrease the environmental impact of tomatoes consumed in Sweden, when compared to import from the Netherlands. There were a couple of combinations of production scenarios and impact categories where the Dutch production performed better, but the Swedish production scenarios performed better in general. The results also clearly showed that scenarios using LED lighting systems consistently had a lower impact than similar production scenarios using high-pressure sodium lighting systems.

To quantify the environmental impacts of products and organisations the methodology of life cycle assessment (LCA) is applied area-wide in many different sectors. The higher education sector in particular has an important role to play in sustainable development due to the multiplier role by educating the academic employees of the future. Additionally, higher education institutions (HEIs) are a relevant sector by themselves due to their size and number of employees as well as their impact on innovation and future technologies. Therefore, HEIs should be at the forefront of assessing and reducing their environmental impact. In contrast to this an analysis of the available LCAs of HEIs shows significant limitations with regards to availability of assessments as well as guidelines on assessment methodologies. To contribute to closing this gap and increase the availability of LCA information for HEIs, a guideline is developed based on current LCA standards, which contains assistance regarding the goal and scope definition, life cycle inventory and life cycle impact assessment. The guideline is applied in a case study for Leibniz Universität Hannover (LUH), one of the nine leading technical universities in Germany. Results of the case study show that the major contributors for the impact of the LUH are the transport activities, infrastructure and energy supply. In 13 of the 16 assessed impact categories, transport activities account for the largest share of potential environmental impacts, ranging from about 43% to 82%.

However, how the SOCS change under the impacts of both GGP and climate change remains unclear. Here, we investigated the impacts of climate change and the GGP on SOCS of the top 1 m soil on the LP during 1980–2015, using a data-driven model and a multi-period land use/cover dataset. Our SOCS estimates showed that SOCS of grasslands and forestlands on the LP ranged from approximately 1400 ± 75 to 1700 ± 77 Tg C during 1980–2015. The SOCS of grasslands ranged from approximately 1000 ± 56 to 1200 ± 58 Tg C, which were roughly twice those of forestlands.

Unexpectedly, the SOCS did not significantly enhance after the GGP was implemented. Compared to 1995, the SOCS of grasslands and forestlands on the LP only increased on average by approximately 3.7% during 2000–2015, due mainly the adverse impact of climate change, as well as the limited effect of vegetation restoration on SOC at the early stage of the vegetation restoration programs.

Sewage sludge (SS) as a viable feedstock for biodiesel production was recognized due to its abundance, consistent availability, and low cost. However, certain limitations, such as pretreatment and drying, are challenging. This study assessed biodiesel production costs from dewatered and wet SS in Japan, utilizing Aspen Plus for simulations. Estimated costs are 0.09 USD/kg and 0.084 USD/kg for dewatered and wet SS, respectively. Biodiesel prices and cost-influencing factors are analyzed, revealing a potential break-even price as low as 540 USD/t (70% below market price) with a positive net value of 8331 USD. Remarkably, producing biodiesel from SS is found to be nine times cheaper than Japan's current biodiesel production cost. The proposed SS biorefinery strategy, integrated within Japanese WWTPs, is a notable outcome. But the limitations and uncertainties that may affect these results are also highlighted for the reader's consideration.

This review paper provides an extensive overview of the recent advances, challenges, and opportunities associated with the production, properties, applications, and commercialization potential of biomass-based activated carbon monoliths. The review covers the various production routes for these monoliths and how process variables affect their yield, textural, morphological, elemental, mechanical, and electrical properties. The basic steps used in their production include pre-treatment, activation, carbonization, pelletization, or moulding. Notably, carbonization and activation were consistently employed, regardless of the synthesis route explored. The highest reported yield (45.1%) was obtained for a coconut shell-based monolith. Biomass-based activated carbon monoliths have demonstrated diverse applications as adsorbents, catalysts or catalyst supports, energy storage materials, electrode materials in supercapacitors, and gas storage. The review also explores the technical and economic challenges that impact their commercialization, such as feedstock availability and variability, process optimization, quality control, and market competition. Finally, the paper provides insights into future prospects and research directions, including interdisciplinary collaborations, advancements in computational modeling and data-driven approaches, and the potential of biomass-based activated carbon monoliths to contribute to sustainable and green technologies. This study aims to serve as a valuable resource for researchers, industry professionals, and policymakers interested in biomass-based activated carbon monoliths and their potential as sustainable and innovative materials.

Although the negative effect of lipids excess in anaerobic digestion is known, there is limited knowledge of what happens at transcriptomics level when the microbial community is exposed to such kind of incidents. The present study aimed to shed light on the response of the biogas microbiome under an impact load of long chain fatty acids. The utilization of genome-centric metagenomics has provided novel insights into the microcosm of biogas reactors. Remarkably, this approach led for the first time to discovery of Nigerium sp. and has also illuminated the functionalities of this microorganism within this specific environment. Furthermore, a revelation emerged associated with the ability of Candidatus Hydrogenedentes sp. for β-oxidation. The transcriptional analysis revealed the Cluster of Orthologous Group (COG) category “Lipid metabolism” as the dominant category in up-regulated genes.

The potential future distresses were analyzed, quantified, and cataloged, then the effectiveness of optional adaptation measures included adjustment of structure thickness, dynamic modulus, and creep stiffness were analyzed. Finally, a method to select and quantify the adaptation measures was developed based on the effectiveness analysis of adaptation measures. The major findings of this study are listed below: (1) Temperature rise is the general trend, rutting and fatigue issue is typical issue caused by climate change. (2) Extreme low temperature issue would occur more severe for some area in future, up to 35% of pavement would have more severe thermal crack issue caused by climate change in 2050s.

Previous research conclusions on green consumption behaviour still have not effectively addressed the problem of “attitude-behaviour” deviation in this new context. Based on the theory of empathy, this study construct a model of how environmental concern influence green consumption behaviour with consumer cognitive empathy and emotional empathy as mediating variables, and Time-Space-Connections (perceived control) as the moderator. This study chose delivery consumption as the research background and empirically tested the data collected from the questionnaire using a structural equation model. The results indicate that environmental concern can positively promote green consumption behaviour, and empathy is a key mechanism that affects green consumption decision-making. Promoting consumers' concern to the environment will effectively enhance their level of cognitive and emotional empathy towards the environment, thereby improving green consumption behaviour. In addition, perceived control significantly moderates the impact of environmental concern on empathy.

It is challenging for SMEs to assess their level of business sustainability and identify actions to diminish environmental impact. Sustainability assessment models have been developed for this purpose, but a process focus is missing. Green business process management (Green BPM) aims at reducing the negative environmental impact of organizations through business processes rather than only considering final products and services. Combining literature from business sustainability and Green BPM, our study conceptualizes a Green BPM maturity model and, through multiple case study research, uses it to assess the Green BPM practices of ten manufacturing SMEs. The results reveal the level of business sustainability of SMEs based on six Green BPM factors: green attitude, strategy, governance, modeling, monitoring, and optimization. We further identify relevant benefits, pressures, and barriers that can drive or hinder Green BPM practices.

Investigating citizen and consumer preferences for the future direction of livestock farming policy";"The sustainable transition of livestock farming has moved on the agenda of international and national policy regulations aimed at the mounting sustainability challenges. Until now, the political debate has been focused on how to change production and management practices to enhance animal welfare or reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The question about the number of livestock, however, has been neglected so far. In particular, this is true for the question of what a socially accepted development of livestock numbers could look like. Thus, the objective of this study was to investigate citizen preferences for a sustainable transition of livestock farming regarding the number of livestock, and whether citizen preferences align with consumer preferences. The sample consisted of 1030 German participants who were surveyed online in January and February 2021. A latent profile analysis (LPA) identified two sub-groups within the population labelled “status-quo proponents” (49.0%) and “proponents of a sustainable transition” (51.0%) that differed in their perception of the development of future livestock numbers. “Status-quo proponents” were aware of the sustainability challenges in livestock production but less interested in supporting the transition with their consumption behavior of animal-based products. For “proponents of a sustainable transition”, a reduction of livestock numbers was a viable pathway for the livestock sector. They were willing to adapt their consumption behavior accordingly. To reach a socially accepted transition of livestock farming, including a reduction of animal numbers, the transition should be supported by a combination of political push and pull measures, such as financial support for farmers, as well as information provision, nudging, and taxes on the market side.";"2023-03-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623002949";"4";"Waste Other"

However, there are few previous studies that combine spatial and temporal scales to explore the impact of future land use changes on ecosystem carbon storage in coastal zones at the provincial scale. Taking the coastal zone of Hainan Island as an example, Landsat TM (OLI) data from 1990, 2000, 2010 and 2020 were used as the main data sources to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution of land use from 1990 to 2020. The GeoSOS-FLUS model was used to predict land use patterns under baseline, development priority and ecological priority scenarios in 2030. Based on land use data, ArcGIS and Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-offs (InVEST) models were used to evaluate the carbon storage of ecosystems from 1990 to 2030, to explore the spatial and temporal evolution of LULCC and response of the LULCC to carbon storage, and to reveal the process and mechanism of the impact of the complex land use change process on the carbon sink service function of regional ecosystems in tropical and subtropical coastal zones. The results showed that: 1) From 1990 to 2020, the area of cropland, forest land, grassland and unused land decreased, while the area of water and built-up land increased. Unused land and cropland area continues to decrease, built-up land continues to increase. 2) LULCC has led to a continuous decrease in regional carbon storage over 30 years, reaching 1.5 × 106 t, with an annual change rate of 5.0 × 104 t/a. The extensive expansion of built-up land and the degradation of forest land are significant reasons for the decrease in carbon density, and “unused land→grassland” is the most obvious reason in the carbon storage increase. “Grassland→forest land (artificial)"" is the most significant mapping reason in the decrease of carbon storage. The spatial and temporal characteristics of regional carbon storage showed a significant positive correlation with the region, and the wetland and mangrove areas in the southwest and northeast directions were the high-high concentration areas of carbon storage. 3) The built-up land in 2020–2030 shows different degrees of expansion in the baseline, development priority and ecological priority scenarios, with an increase of 1.94%, 2.13% and 0.70% respectively, and the development priority scenario has the largest increase. The cropland showed a shrinking trend in 3 simulated scenarios, and the area decreased by 0.87%, 0.97% and 0.87%, respectively. 4) The regional carbon storage in 2020–2030 decreases significantly under the baseline and development priority scenarios, at 1.29 × 105 t and 2.45 × 105 t respectively, while it increases significantly under the ecological priority scenario, at 1.34 × 105 t. The ecological priority scenario can effectively enhance the carbon sink capacity and control the reduction of cropland area. Optimizing the land use structure, controlling the growth rate of built-up land and increasing the area of forest land can have a positive effect on the development and use of coastal zone space and the carbon cycle.

However, how MPs influence photosynthesized C flow from plants to soil remains unclear, creating large uncertainties in the projection of C dynamics in plant-soil-atmosphere systems. Herein, a 13C-labeling technique was applied to unravel the photosynthesized C fluxes from maize to soil under different levels of simulated polyethylene (PE) MPs pollution (0, 1% and 5%) in soil. Resultantly, the 1% and 5% PE MPs treatments significantly decreased the net fixed 13C in the maize–soil system. However, the effect of PE MPs on photosynthate–13C transfer in the maize–soil system was highly concentration–speciﬁc, that is, the addition of 1% PE MPs reduced the transfer of photosynthate–13C to the belowground part (−44.6%) and soil (−36.3%), whereas these effects were not observed for 5% PE MPs. PE MPs addition did not change soil moisture and bulk density. The addition of 1% PE MPs increased soil microbial biomass and decreased soil nitrogen (N) availability (inorganic and organic N). The treatment with 5% PE MPs decreased soil microbial community diversity, and altered the microbial community structure. Soil pH, organic N, and aboveground and belowground plant biomass mainly controlled the soil 13C content. These findings suggest that plant–soil systems polluted by PE MPs would sequester less photosynthesized C to belowground parts and soil through reducing plant photosynthetic carbon assimilation and transfer. Thus, potential changes in soil C stocks under MPs pollution should be considered for predicting global C dynamics and sustainable agricultural production.

The in-situ synthesis mechanism of nitride whiskers and the optimized processing parameters of preparing the ceramics from the binary CG-Al system were studied systematically. Results indicated that Al chips as reducing agent could reduce CG to produce silicon at 1000–1100 °C, and their relics provided pores for in-situ synthesizing nitride whiskers by the gaseous reaction between SiO, Al2O and N2 via Vapor-Solid mechanism.

The mechanical properties of the stabilized DC using the ternary AAM were investigated through laboratory tests, and microstructure tests were performed to reveal the stabilization mechanism of the treated DC. The results revealed that the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of the stabilized specimens was significantly affected by the initial water content of DC and decreased with the increasing initial water content. The UCS of the stabilized DC using the ternary AAM can be increased by 1.24–4.33 times compared to using the GGBS-FA binary AAM alone. The UCS of the stabilized DC first increased and then decreased as the DG content increased. The optimal DG content was 8% for the DC with an initial water content of 1.4–2.0 times the liquid limit (1.4–2.0w L).

As a typical industrial by-product during the flue gas desulfurization process of coal-fired, flue gas desulfurization ash (FGDA) with alkali mineral can facilitate the water damage resistance of asphalt mixtures. However, low density and high hydrophilic coefficient of FGDA limit its improvement effect. Hence, the comprehensive moisture susceptibility of asphalt mixtures with FGDA deserves systematic investigation. In this study, the properties indexes of FGDA and FGDA-limestone filler (LF) composite fillers were characterized. And the moisture susceptibility of asphalt mixtures containing six dosages of FGDA-LF fillers under hydrostatic damage and moisture induced sensitivity tester (MIST) hydrodynamic damage conditions were determined. The comprehensive assessment index of FLAM was explored based on radar chart assessment mean. The results indicate that FGDA with high alkali minerals and flocculent sphere morphology promotes the improvement of dispersivity and compatibility and the generation of homogeneous integral structure. Incorporating FGDA in FGDA-LF composite filler degrades its apparent density and elevates fineness and hydrophilic coefficient. Under MIST hydrodynamic damage, FLAM demonstrates the larger RMS and TSR than asphalt mixture with LF, accompanied by smaller attenuation compared to hydrostatic treatment. FLAM with F3 reveals the lowest rutting depth of 8.65 mm and creep slope of 1.92 × 10−4 and the largest comprehensive assessment index of 0.9998, indicating its optimal comprehensive moisture susceptibility.

Supercritical water gasification (SCWG) is proposed to convert PM to H2-enriched syngas without the drying process for wet materials. This paper studied the effect of diverse parameters on H2-enriched syngas production. The results revealed that higher temperatures and alkaline catalysts elevated total gas yield and H2 yield, with the addition of K2CO3 at 620 °C, 30 min, and 6 wt% feed concentration generating the highest total gas yield (36.55 mol/kg), H2 yield (18.89 mol/kg), and mole fraction (51.55%), accompanied by a high gasification efficiency (87.59%). Based on product characterization and thermodynamic analysis, reaction mechanisms were proposed to provide insight into enhancing syngas production, indicating that the suppression of polymerization reactions between cyclic compounds and the promotion of CH4, C2H6, and long-chain alkanes conversion were essential. Further, the environmental impact evaluation showed that heavy metals (Cu, Cr, As, and Zn) were concentrated in solid products by adsorption and passivation.

How to balance economic cost and environmental benefits in China's sludge treatment industry is an important issue that the government urgently needs to address. This article selects 9 types of municipal sludge treatment plants (MSTP) that can represent different treatment methods and scales in China, and attempts to help all provinces in China find the optimal solution for maximizing sludge treatment benefits (economic benefits and environmental benefits) under different constraints (economic constraints and environmental constraints). Firstly, this paper analyzes the economic and environmental costs and return of 9 types of MSTP. Secondly, we use the unguided Super-SBM model to combine the costs and return of 9 types of MSTP to measure the benefits of each plant. It has been found that under ideal conditions, medium Incineration treatment (IT) and large building material (BM) utilization are the most beneficial options for sludge treatment in China. Finally, we use a simple linear programming model to establish a constrained linear programming model for the environment and economy, substituting provinces that are divided into four categories under different constraint conditions into the model, and finding the optimal ratio for each type of province to build MSTP, in order to maximize benefits. Research has found that after adding constraints, the future development trend of municipal sludge treatment in China will mainly focus on small BM utilization and medium LA. This research result has universal applicability. As long as the constraints of this article are met, any country or province can adjust the construction proportion of municipal sludge treatment plants according to the research results of this article.

In addition, an important feature is the continuous hydrolysis of TCCA in an aqueous solution to produce oxidants (HClO) while maintaining the effective chlorination concentration at a high level. The various factors affecting TCCA leaching carbonaceous pressure-oxidized gold ore were investigated and the leaching kinetics were established. According to the results of orthogonal experiments, the optimal conditions of TCCA concentration 0.25 mol L−1, NaCl concentration 50 g L−1, pH 5.5, leaching temperature 45 °C and solid-liquid ratio 1:6 could be obtained, and the gold leaching efficiency reached (88.64 ± 0.37) % within 3 h. After the three stages of TCCA leaching, a gold leaching efficiency was increased to 94.39%. Furthermore, TCCA leaching process could be divided into three steps, the findings of kinetic models revealed that in the early leaching step (0–2 h), TCCA leaching was controlled by solid products layer diffusion model, and yet shifted to be controlled by interfacial chemical reaction model in the final step. Importantly, TCCA leaching solution might be converted into a disinfectant with an effective chlorination concentration of 16.075% treated with resin adsorption and alum removal, enabling the secondary utilization of wastewater resources.

However, selecting the optimal backfill material is complex and involves multiple criteria. This study aimed to develop a new approach to assist in the selection process by rationally dealing with the subjective judgment of decision makers. The approach employed fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) methods. Initially, consistent judgment matrices were established based on a unique consulting questionnaire. The fuzzy AHP method used Buckley's method to calculate the fuzzy weights of pairwise comparisons. The fuzzy TOPSIS method was then employed to rank and evaluate four different backfill materials. The proposed methodology was successfully implemented at a real contaminated site in China to select the appropriate backfill material for construction of a slurry trench cutoff wall.

Herein, microwave (MW)-activated persulfate (PS) system was proposed for remediation of organochlorine pesticide contaminated soil with atrazine (ATZ) as representation. The results revealed that the MW/PS system could achieve 97.9% of ATZ (50 mg/kg) degradation after treatment of 60 min, superior to that by conventional heat-activated PS. And more excellent degradation performance was identified in relatively higher microwave temperature (80 °C) with appropriate PS concentration (24 mmol/L), MW power (400 W) and water-soil ratio (1:1). Moreover, the MW/PS system possessed high tolerance to co-existing substances including C l − , H C O 3 − and H 2 P O 4 − , and appropriate organic substance content favored ATZ degradation in soil. Reactive oxygen species consisting of S O 4 • − , O H • , O 2 • − and 1O2 contributed to ATZ decomposition, among which O 2 ∙ − played a principal role. The ATZ degradation pathway was then elucidated by combination of HPLC/MS spectra and DFT calculations, and ATZ overall toxicity was effectively alleviated in MW/PS system in term of toxicity assessment. Additionally, the MW/PS system presented high-performance degradation on such organochlorine pesticides as trichloro ethylene, tetrachloride, hexachlorobenzene and chlordane, suggesting great potentials of this system for remediation of organochlorine pesticides contaminated sites.

This research is aimed at fabricating special plywood with ultra-high strength using environmentally friendly vacuum assisted resin transfer molding (VARTM) technology. Using the clean VARTM technology, the special plywood was fabricated from wood veneers, which were potential to be used for structural applications. In addition, the characteristics of veneer and VARTM technology make it possible to solve the difficult tasks in the preparation of large-format special plywood. The results showed that the flexural strength (261.0 MPa) and modulus (13.7 GPa) of the special plywood were 3-fold and 4-fold higher than the traditional plywood (76.7 MPa and 3.6 GPa), respectively, which were contributed by the VARTM technology for fewer pores in the special plywood. Compared to the natural wood, the porosity of the special plywood was reduced from 59.4% to 9.2%, so the flexural strength (261.0 MPa) and flexural modulus (12.9 GPa) were increased by 288.7% and 201.6%, respectively. Water resistance of the special plywood was also improved significantly, for instance, the 72-h water absorption was approximately 6-times lower than that of the traditional plywood.

The primary objective of this study was to investigate the impact of temporary storage of runoff in TDA on the leaching of fifteen metals and sorption of phosphate present in synthetic stormwater. Furthermore, the study analyzed the impact of chloride concentration on leaching and sorption potential of TDA based stormwater treatment systems. The analysis of stormwater effluents from different reactors reveals that in the reactors with TDA, the phosphate concentration was substantially reduced over time, while there was no significant change in the phosphate concentration in the reactors without TDA. The TDA, however, leached zinc, copper and iron into the synthetic stormwater. Even though the rate of leaching decreased with more flushes, the concentrations of iron and zinc after 72 h were still generally above the fresh water chronic criteria for aquatic biota. Thus, it may be necessary to place metal-adsorbing material in with the TDA to adsorb the leached metals. This combination of treatments could provide a stormwater storage system that adsorbs dissolved phosphate and captures particulate phosphorous via settling, without releasing toxic metals.

The widespread use of these body coveralls poses a significant threat to terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, given their polluting nature and disposal frequency. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the adoption of alternatives that increase the safe reusability of PPE clothing and reduce environmental and health hazards.

Currently, the environmental impact assessment for remediation technologies is primarily based on site-specific data, which makes the assessment results difficult to apply to different site conditions. In our study, an abandoned rubber factory site in the Jiangsu Province of China was used as an example to evaluate the life cycle impact of three frequently used soil remediation strategies including cement kiln co-processing, onsite ex-situ thermal desorption, and offsite ex-situ thermal desorption. The results show that when considering the subsequent disposal of contaminated soil after remediation, the environmental impacts of remediating 1 ton of contaminated soil decrease according to the following order: offsite ex-situ thermal desorption, onsite ex-situ thermal desorption, and cement kiln co-processing. The results also indicate that contaminated soil volume and transport distance profoundly affect the environmental impacts of contaminated soil remediation. Based on these findings, we proposed a generalized method for selecting the most environmentally friendly remediation technology under various site characteristics. Within the developed method, we examined remediation options for 43 sites contaminated by organic chemicals in Jiangsu Province. The simulation results suggest that the optimized remediation options could have reduced environmental impacts by as much as 61.1%.

In arable coastal lands, low soil quality often results in limited crop yield and soil organic carbon (SOC), making them promising sites for enhancing both soil carbon sequestration and agricultural production. However, a scarcity of long-term site experiments has led to a research gap regarding SOC sequestration in coastal arable lands, leaving potential uncertainties due to variations in planting systems, crop yields, and the influence of climate change. In this study, we focused on the Yellow River Delta (YRD) in China, which is a typical coastal agricultural area. We verified the adaptability of the Denitrifcation-Decomposition (DNDC) model in coastal farmlands based on an 11-year long-term observation experiment and continuous sampling survey data. We further explored the spatiotemporal changes of regional SOC stocks under two Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios based on five Global Climate Models (GCMs) derived from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), along with three yield increase scenarios from 2020 to 2100. The results indicated that promoting single-cotton cultivation in coastal saline–alkali lands would result in at least 88.2% of farmland being converted into carbon sinks. In contrast, promoting the cultivation of a wheat–maize rotation system can promote regional SOC sequestration as a whole, with a maximum increase of 31.90 Mg C ha−1. By 2100, the SOC stocks decreased in cotton and wheat–maize rotation farmland by 3.9% and 11.6%, respectively, in the SSP585 scenario compared with that in the SSP126 scenario. Except for farmlands with wheat-maize rotation cropping system under the SSP126 scenario, the SOC stocks in all other scenarios are projected to reach their theoretical maximum values before 2050.

N application rates notably increased net energy, CFa, NFa, ecosystem service value, and ecosystem economic benefits. After considering the comprehensive index of energy, environment, the economy and the ecosystem economy, the sustainability performance index of MCN2 (Orychophragmus violaceus and Vicia villosa mixture/cotton relay intercropping with 168.75 kg N hm−2) combination increase by 51.7% compared to all treatments average. Taken together, the study results demonstrated that introducing cover crop mixture into monoculture cotton was more sustainable and cleaner cotton production practice than sing cover crop or fallow in the Yellow River basin and other regions with similar ecological conditions.

Even though the academic interest in biochar has increased, it is not being used at a large scale yet, mainly because of its economic infeasibility compared to fertilizers and because farmers are either unaware of or skeptical about its effects. In this paper, the economics of biochar are examined by performing a systematic review, following the guidelines of the Collaboration for Environmental Evidence. Specifically, it has been examined to which extent the production and application of biochar are yet profitable from an investor's perspective and desirable from a societal perspective. For the first time, this review investigates the extent to which previous studies have included external costs and benefits. We find that profitability and desirability of biochar production and use are highly uncertain and case-specific, depending on factors like location, feedstock, scale, pyrolysis conditions, biochar price, cultivated crop, and the potential internalization of externalities, which hampers private investment. To advance biochar development and deployment, those factors must be considered carefully for each case. Although externalities are included in the literature to some extent, the focus is mostly on external benefits rather than external costs, often focusing on its carbon sequestration potential. The inclusion of externalities in economic assessments is necessary to provide solid arguments to develop policies for the acceleration of market uptake of biochar technology.

It is critical to minimize soil organic carbon (SOC) loss, but there is limited understanding of best land management practices for these Northern agricultural frontiers. We conducted a measurement campaign to assess changes in SOC after land conversion from native forest to either permanent pasture or to arable cropping by measuring SOC content (0–60 cm) at six farms with different land uses over the past 68 years (1950–2018). The Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC) model was validated for historical SOC trends and then used to assess the impacts of future climate change on crop yields, SOC stocks, and SOC sequestration rates from 1954 to 2070 under three Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) scenarios from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6. Three land uses (1) continuous barley-oats (BO), (2) continuous Legume hay-BO, (3) continuous Pasture; and two land use conversions (4) pasture from 1954 to 2014 and then converted to BO from 2015 to 2070 (Pasture » BO) and (5) BO from 1954 to 2014 and then converted to pasture from 2015 to 2070 (BO » Pasture) were considered. Averaged across all six farms, the measured SOC stocks 68 years after conversion from forest were 22.7 and 25.3% higher under pasture than under forest and arable cropping, respectively. The DNDC demonstrated good performance in simulating yields of annual crops, legume hay and pasture as well as SOC stocks across all sites. Under future climate scenarios, higher SOC stocks were predicted for all land use conversions relative to the historical period, except for Pasture » BO. Under different land use, predicted SOC stocks were highest for continuous pasture, followed by BO » Pasture, Pasture » BO, Legume hay-BO and lowest for continuous BO. The DNDC predicted that the SOC sequestration rate would decrease for all land uses in the period 2015–2070 relative to 1954–2014, except for BO » Pasture. The predicted change declined from 0.35 to 0.22–0.28 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 for continuous pasture, but when change in management occurred from BO to pasture the rate of SOC gain increased. This underscores the potential role of pasture and crop diversification in avoiding SOC losses in agricultural frontiers induced by climate-warming.

Humification is a major carbon sequestration strategy that can be enhanced using many biotic and abiotic catalysts. With the application of catalysts during composting, the content of humic substances can increase by more than 100% compared to control samples. Despite growing interest, there is a lack of comprehensive reviews of the different humification pathways driven by adding various types of catalysts. In this review, we consulted recent literature to compare catalysts with respect to their humification potentials, pathways, products, and operating conditions. We critically evaluated the advantages and limitations of individual catalysts to elucidate gaps in current knowledge and future research directions. In general, biotic catalysts show higher performance compared to metal oxides, whereas abiotic catalysts can be produced at a lower cost. Among the biotic catalysts, laccase is particularly attractive due to its eco-friendliness and high performance. Among abiotic catalysts, MnO2 had the highest humification activity compared to other metal oxides, such as Fe2O3 or Al2O3, whereas clays with a 2:1-layered structure demonstrated higher potential than did those with a 1:1 structure. More research is recommended using advanced techniques to provide a more comprehensive comparison of catalyst performance. Finally, we have discussed the potential of novel catalysts to enhance humification. ";"2023-05-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623009903";"43";"Waste Other

For these reasons, the major areas of improvement should be identified in terms of both consumption and production. This paper aims at implementing Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) to achieve a comprehensive diagnosis of the environmental impacts of food supply at a city level, and to provide adequate recommendations on how to perform data collection. Initially designed to quantify the environmental performance of a product or service, proposals have been made to adapt LCA to city and territory scales. However, applications are still scarce, as data collection can be very resource-intensive. Most existing studies apply a top-down approach that presents a number of limitations. For example, an overly aggregated representation of the studied sectors is proposed, while mainly greenhouse gas impacts are quantified without addressing a broad coverage of environmental issues. In this paper, a bottom-up approach is adopted, where the collected data concerns a comparison between two data sources involving individual food consumption (i.e. a national and a local survey). AGRIBALYSE 3.0 database is used for life cycle inventories of food products and different methods are employed to scale up the analysis to city level. Results indicate that the main impacts arise from animal product consumption and agricultural production stages, with certain variations according to the impact category and considered food product. A comparison between national and local data on food consumption confirms that average national data are sufficient for an initial diagnosis. One of the next challenges will be to improve the LCA databases. Although they now include several hundred foodstuffs, they do not distinguish between alternative practices (e.g., for agricultural or retailing step) and product sources.

However, economic growth in this way can be accompanied by increased income inequality and population poverty, deterioration of environmental conditions, the disproportionality of territorial development, etc., which requires increased social responsibility. The concept of inclusive social responsibility of energy industry enterprises can be at the forefront of solving this problem, which is designed to ensure the maximum inclusion and interaction of all members of society of all strata of the population in economic activity to increase the level of employment, social responsibility, social and territorial unity. The authors proposed a methodology for assessing the state of inclusive social responsibility of energy industry enterprises, which considers the industry specifics of fuel and energy enterprises. The offered method of assessment of inclusive social responsibility, unlike the existing ones, includes in its focus the following components: social (taking into account vulnerable categories of the population), socially responsible attitude (definition of the main values, law-abiding enterprise, thrifty attitude to ecology, etc.) and economic, emphasizing the importance of the company's profit-making to ensure its sustainable and inclusive development; each of the proposed indicators has a universal character, helps the energy company to examine its internal business processes and find bottlenecks in its operations, and using them as an aggregated system has a synergistic effect. Because all indicators of the presented system are characterized by percentages or certain levels and are evaluated in points, a competitive evaluation can be carried out among enterprises that have different sizes and different scopes of activity, also without reference to their location. The methodology is based on the calculation of the integral indicator, the synergistic effect and the relationship of 20 indicators of the aggregated system, including the methodology of expert assessments, mathematical modelling, in particular, transported matrices.

For making eco-friendly building design decisions, a prerequisite is to understand which design variables affect the environmental impacts of a building over its life cycle is. This research conducts a critical review to identify design variables affecting the environmental impacts of buildings at three design stages during the design processes. Publications between 2010 and 2022 (inclusive) are examined and 50 papers are selected for review. The results reveal that eight design variables in early design stages, including (1) building aspect ratio, (2) window-to-wall ratio, (3) shading area, (4) building orientation, (5) number of floors, (6) building shape, (7) floor area and (8) floor-to-floor height, have an impact on a building's life-cycle environmental impacts. In detailed design stages, there are four kinds of design variables linked with the environmental impacts of a building: (1) types of building components, (2) sizes of building components, (3) types of building materials, and (4) thickness of building materials. Types of finishing materials are closely related to the environmental impacts of a building in construction design stages.

The quantitative evaluation of environmental impacts in manufacturing systems represents a key activity in supporting environmental management systems of industrial organizations with impact-oriented information to enable transformative processes towards “zero impact”. Since 2014 and together with various research partners, Volkswagen Group Production has developed the “Impact Points”-method, which is based on the Ecological Scarcity Method (ESM). It applies a “distance-to-target”-weighted thinking and enables a systemic and regionalized evaluation of environmental impacts associated with the global manufacturing system of Volkswagen. This paper presents the developed system boundary, provides the data inventory and highlights the calculation principles for the derived ecofactors to quantify absolute impacts of Volkswagen's global manufacturing system. A total of 389 ecofactors have been calculated for 89 Volkswagen Production sites in 21 countries to quantify the environmental impacts due to primary energy use, CO2 equivalents, air pollution, local water risk, waste water and waste generation. The method is exemplarily applied on representative production sites to highlight its advantages as well as novelties compared to the ESM and the aggregatability of results on five aggregation levels from process level to the global manufacturing system. Volkswagen applies the presented approach within its “Zero Impact Factory”-strategy to measure the transformative progress towards ecological effectiveness of its global manufacturing system.

They are renewable, clean, increase energy security, and improve the environment. The seed oil of Chrysobalanus icaco was characterised using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrophotometer (GCMS) and Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). The heterogeneous solid catalyst of periwinkle shell ash was prepared in 3 forms: raw, calcined and acid-activated. They were characterised using Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) and FTIR. The results of the SEM analysis revealed the calcined samples to be a better choice because of their larger surface area. The result showed that the oil yield of the used crop was promising for commercial biodiesel production, with Chrysobalanus icaco having a yield of 51.90%. The reusability of the catalyst for continuous reaction runs showed that biofuel yield was still high after five cycles: 92.25–80.60% for calcined periwinkle shell ash (PSA) catalyst and 89.26–78.50% for acid-activated PSA catalyst. The result of the fuel properties of the biodiesel and their blend indicated their suitability for biodiesel production. Methyl ester blends of 20:80 had viscosity that placed them in 2D grade diesel (2.0–4.3 mm2/s), helpful in powering stationary equipment.

Therefore, it is important to consider spatial topological relationships and the need for carbon neutrality in the optimization of ENs. The optimization of EN structures and functions should be a systematic multi-objective process. This study combined landscape ecology, the complex network model, and spatial analysis technology, proposing an ecological barrier–topological feature–carbon offset-based (BTC-based) model research framework to deeply analyze and optimize ENs. First, the EN was preliminarily identified using the circuit theory model and the ecological barrier areas were simulated. Then, based on the complex network model, an undirected and unweighted complex network was established and its topological structural characteristics were analyzed. By constructing the estimation model for the carbon offset rate, its spatial distribution characteristics were calculated and interpreted. Finally, the BTC-based model was used to optimize the EN. Based on this model, Guizhou Province (a typical karst region in China) was taken as the research area for this study.

Unfortunately, the effects within this process are still inadequate and spatially explicit knowledge of the surplus-deficit status for multiple ESs remain under-researched. The study area is the Bairin Left Banner, located in North East of China. In detail, a comprehensive framework was proposed to fill this research gap by coupling the assessment of ESs supply-demand, spatial correlations and driving analysis. The results showed that: (1) the surplus for all ESs was dominant in northern mountains covered with forests whereas deficit was observed in southern urban areas. Specifically, the spatially mismatched supply-demand pattern for habitat quality and carbon storage was predominant while that relation for soil conservation and water yield was spatially aligned in general. (2) the relationships between ESs supply and demand were affected by different socio-ecological factors with positive effects from natural drivers while negative influences from social factors on the whole. The supply-demand matching degrees for habitat quality and water yield were more susceptible to slope and population density. Precipitation and vegetation were proved to be dominant factors for controlling surplus of soil conservation while the supply-demand pattern for carbon storage was mainly affected by vegetation and population. (3) The results of multi-scale geographically weighted regression showed its superiority with more accurate estimations compared to traditional methods. Drastic human activities would adversely affect ESs supply-demand matching while abundant precipitation coupled with more vegetation could create favorable conditions for forming surplus ESs status. Based on these new findings, some land planning and eco-environment management measures were suggested to achieve the supply-demand coordination of various ESs in arid regions.

Changing current diets to healthier and more sustainable ones is key to decrease the incidence of non-communicable diseases and force changes at the production stage that will release environmental pressure. The determination of such diets is a challenge since it should be context specific, culturally acceptable, affordable, nutritionally adequate, and environmentally friendly. Through multiobjective optimization we aimed to determine a sustainable and healthy diet(SHD) in Spain with the minimum cost and environmental impact (assessed through GHGe, land use and blue-water use) that deviate the least from current consumption. Additionally, this research also compares the optimised diet with the Spanish food-based dietary guidelines(FBDG), and explores the potential benefits of reducing animal meat and milk while replacing them with plant-based alternatives. Compared to current consumption, a SHD in Spain can be more nutritious and reduce cost, GHGe, land and blue-water use by 32%, 46%, 27%, and 41%, respectively. The Spanish intake displayed the worst nutritional assessment and the highest values for GHGe and land use. The Spanish FBDG showed the highest cost and blue-water usage. Further analysis revealed that plant-based meat alternatives are not necessary to achieve a nutritionally adequate diet at the minimum cost and environmental impact. Shifting to fortified plant-based milk alternatives may add additional environmental benefits.

However, the lack of driving mechanisms and regulatory pathways for ecosystem health limit the development of effective environmental management policies and urban planning. In this study, taking the Middle Reaches of the Yellow River (MRYR) of China as the study area, we introduced spatial weight coefficient and modified coefficient of spatial proximity effect to improve the “Vigor–Organization-Resilience-Ecosystem services” (VORS) model, and adopted the improved VORS model to dynamically assess the ecosystem health level. Then, we provide an in-depth analysis of the mechanisms of climate and human activities affecting ecosystem health. Finally, the multi-scale regulation of ecosystem health was implemented. The results showed that topography, climate, population urbanization, economic urbanization, land urbanization, agricultural activities, environmental pollution, regional policies and other factors all have a significant impact on the ecosystem health, but the direction and extent of impact had obvious spatial heterogeneity. The negative impact of potential evapotranspiration on ecosystem health is significantly higher in urban agglomerations than in other regions. Regular and compact urban forms are conducive to the health of urban ecosystems, and appropriate urban size and strict urban development boundaries are conducive to maintaining high level of ecosystem health in riverine cities.

The results show that, over recent decades, impervious constructed areas and Spartina alterniflora-covered saltmarsh have increased to 10.7% and 2.61%, respectively, whereas native species saltmarshes and tidal flats have decreased to 0.04% and 1.1%, respectively. The total ESV increased significantly during 1960–2000 but significantly declined during 2000–2015. The highest total ESV was US$ 3.8 billion in 2010, considering the approximate contributions of natural and artificial wetlands. Similarly, the ESV of the S. alterniflora saltmarshes reached US$ 0.7 billion in 2015. The total intertidal wetlands area could decrease to 8071–8248/ha by 2100. The total ESV of intertidal wetland ecosystems would decrease by approximately one billion dollars between 2015 and 2050. An enhanced understanding of the economic impacts regarding coastal management, restoration, and conservation is of profound importance for improving coastal resilience, sustainable development, and adaptation of coastal societies to climate change in the Yangtze River Estuary.

The implementation of efficient and fundamental governance methods is crucial as current conventional approaches fail to address the root cause of this problem. To investigate the technique of controlling AMD at its source, a 10-day static experiment was conducted in order to examine the inhibitory effect of Sporosarcina pasteurii (S. pasteurii) on oxidative acid production from pyrite under varying redox potentials (Eh) and Ca2+ concentrations. Additionally, a 180-day dynamic column experiment was carried out to assess the long-term stability of its inhibition and heavy metal fixation. The results of both short-term and long-term analysis indicate that the metabolic activity of S. pasteurii has beneficial effects on the control of AMD through sulfur oxidation, even in the presence of strong oxidants such as H2O2 and FeCl3. 1. It stabilizes pH within the neutral to alkaline range; 2. It maintains Eh at a low potential reducing environment; 3. It promotes an increase in SO4 2− concentration, followed by a decline and stabilization at lower concentrations; 4. It supplies carbonate for pyrite oxidation, maintaining a balance between acid production and consumption. Additionally, SEM, XRD, and XPS results demonstrated that the mineral surface appeared flat without prominent characteristic peaks of oxidation products, indicating effective inhibition of pyrite oxidation by S. pasteurii. The immobilization experiments for heavy metals showed that Cd exhibited the highest fixation effect with a rate of 94%; Mn, Cu, Zn, and Co had the second best fixation effect with ion concentrations decreasing by 82%, 83%, 87%, and 88% respectively; Ni and U(VI) decreased by rates of 75% and 69% respectively. These experimental findings suggest that S.pasteurii can effectively inhibit pyrite oxidation as well as sulfur-containing uranium waste rock oxidation while providing long-term stabilization for heavy metal immobilization.

In this work, a dissolution-modification-reforming process was proposed to upcycle PVC into highly efficient adsorbents (polyethylenimine-crosslinked PVC nanofiber membranes (PEI/PVC NFMs)). The effect of PEI to PVC mass ratio on the preparation of PEI/PVC NFMs was estimated. The adsorption performance of azo dyes on PEI/PVC NFMs was evaluated using Reactive Black 5 (RB5). The acid/alkali resistance of PEI/PVC NFM and its adsorption potential for various ionic pollutants were also investigated. Here are the results: The PEI/PVC NFMs exhibited high RB5 uptake within pH 2 to 8. The amine groups content in PEI/PVC NFM increased with increasing of PEI to PVC mass ratio, resulting in faster adsorption rates and higher adsorption capacity. With the mass ratio of PEI to PVC increased from 0.5:1.0 to 2.0:1.0, the adsorption equilibrium time reduced from 480 to 120 min, while the maximum RB5 uptake increased from 314.5 to 1036.7 mg/g. The adsorption isotherms and thermodynamic analysis revealed that physisorption dominated the adsorption process. The PEI/PVC NFM also exhibited good adsorption potential for various ionic pollutants, including per-/poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and heavy metals (Pb2+, H2AsO4 −, Co2+, and Ni2+). The 30-d acid/alkali resistance test confirmed that the PEI/PVC NFM has better stability at higher pH conditions. The PEI/PVC NFM exhibited good recyclability in azo dye wastewater treatment. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the dissolution-modification-reforming process is a viable route for PVC waste upcycling. This pathway allows the conversion of PVC waste into highly efficient adsorbents for the elimination of ionic pollutants from water.

The highly efficient and inexpensive method for the removal of organics from the leaching solution is of great practical significance for the efficient operation of zinc hydrometallurgy. For this reason, the removal of organic matter from oxygen-pressure leaching solution using modified anode slime was investigated by TOC analysis, FTIR spectroscopy, XRD, GCMS, and other characterization methods, and its mechanism was also discussed. The results show that the removal of organic matter using anode slime modified with sulfuric acid was significantly improved, and the removal of TOC reached 57.83% for anode slime modified at a temperature of 80 °C with a ratio of sulfuric acid to anode slime of 14 mL/100 g, which was more than 2.7 times that of untreated anode slime. The good removal effect of organic matter using the modified anode slime could be attributed to the transformation of inert α-MnO2 to active MnOOH by concentrated sulfuric acid-mediated modification. It was also found that the acid–solid ratio and temperature exhibited a significant effect on the modification of anode slime. The XPS analysis results of Mn 2p, Mn 3s, and O 1s, combined with the XRD patterns of the modified products indicated that the modification of anode slime led to the conversion of MnO2 in anode slime to MnOOH in the presence of H2SO4. However, MnO2 was further converted into high crystallinity MnOOH, even MnSO4 when the temperature exceeded 80 °C or the acid–solid ratio exceeded 18 mL/100 g, resulting in the decreased degradation performance for organic matter. The characterization results of FTIR spectroscopy and GCMS show that modified anode slime does not exhibit a degradation effect on all types of organic substances in leaching solution; however, it is very effective for some alcohols, olefins, and esters.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135516";"Impact of the use of seawater on acid mine drainage from mining wastes ";" The copper mining industry is vital in the transition to fossil-free power for achieving sustainability worldwide, which is mainly based on the exploitation of copper sulfide ores. However, the mineral processing produces a large volume of mine tailings, and their quantity is almost equal to the ores treated. Acid mine drainage (AMD) is a challenging environmental problem caused by tailing disposal when it is not well managed. In addition, several copper mining companies employ seawater in their process because they operate in arid or semi-arid regions, including northern Chile, southern Peru, and Australia. For copper sulfide mineral processing, the use of seawater is not a limitation in the flotation process, and positive and negative effects appear compared to using fresh water. However, there are no records in the literature on the impact of seawater on the generation of AMD, considering that it is a solution with a high concentration of different ions. This study aims to evaluate the chemical stability of synthetic tailings with and without seawater by kinetic tests using seven humidity cells. The synthetic tailings are mixtures of pyrite, chalcopyrite, arsenopyrite, and quartz. The main results show that the AMD generation kinetics after 25 weeks of testing humidity cells leached with distilled water (acid-generating cells) behaved differently than the humidity cells leached with seawater (non-acid-generating cells). After 25 weeks of testing, the acid-generating humidity cells had a pH value below 2.26, while the non-acid-generating humidity cells had a pH value above 7. It was also shown that fine-particle-size granulometry generates AMD faster than coarse-particle-size granulometry. Finally, the sulfide minerals’ ion dissolution occurred when the humidity cells were leached with distilled water and not when leached with seawater. The results show that using non-desalinized seawater in copper ore processing can help prevent AMD due to the buffering effect of seawater and the protection coat formed by oxyhydroxide and/or bivalent cations.

Studying DOM's sources, molecular compositions, and reactivity is central to understanding the fate and environmental effects of organic carbon, yet, links between DOM composition and reactivity remain to be established. In this study, stable carbon isotopic composition and ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) were combined with degradation experiments to comprehensively study DOM's properties in the major rivers across the Pearl River Delta (PRD) in South China. The increasing δ13C-DOC along the Pearl River at the PRD suggests that terrestrial DOM from upstream was gradually diluted by local processes. Although affected by different interaction patterns of multiple sources, a major component of DOM, enriched in CHO and lignins, is molecularly indistinguishable in different rivers (molecular Bray-Curtis dissimilarity of 15%–31%). The photo-degradation removed 34% (PDOC%) of initial DOM within 14 days, twice that by biodegradation (BDOC%). In contrast to earlier research, the distinctive integration of molecular characterization with DOM degradation kinetics indicates that both regional (common shared molecules) and local (partial shared and unique molecules) derived DOM play a collective role in governing the bio-degradation kinetics of DOM, while the photo-degradation kinetics of DOM are barely correlated to molecular composition. The thorough investigation of DOM molecular composition and its correlation with bulk DOM properties in the PRD region, though requiring further investigation into its mechanisms, offers valuable insights into the role of riverine DOM in coastal hypoxia and the global carbon cycle.

Here we report an in-situ self-assembled flower-like ZnIn2S4/CdIn2S4 (ZCIS) composites with excellent catalytic performance for atrazine (ATZ) degradation. The ZCIS-4 composite could degrade 99.82% of ATZ within 40 min, which showed 1.42 and 1.91 times better than blank ZnIn2S4 and CdIn2S4, respectively. The excellent catalytic performance is attributed to the built-in electric field in the in-situ self-assembled composite photocatalyst, which accelerates the rapid transfer of interfacial charges and the rapid separation of photogenerated electron hole pairs. The toxicity assessment shown that some intermediates exhibited decreased toxicities; however, the toxicities were still significant. Active radical capture experiments and electron spin resonance characterization demonstrated that h+, O2 − were the main active free radicals.

Herein, side-engineered triazole-based polymers (TZPs) are reported for efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production without sacrificial agent. The photoelectric properties, mass transfer and photocatalytic activities can be tuned by the distribution of hydroxyl groups on the benzenetricarboxaldehyde ring of TZPs.

Moreover, the hydroxyl group optimizes the H2O wettability of TZPs. Benefiting from the enlarged intermolecular polarization-induced built-in electric field and excellent hydrophilicity, TZP-OE exhibits excellent photocatalytic H2O2 evolution rate of 1618 μmol/L under visible light irradiation, which is 3.5 times that of TZP-NE.

In this study, a series of self-assembled hollow tubular Zn–In–S photocatalysts (Zn-doped In2S3, ZnIn2S4, and ZnS/ZnIn2S4) were first designed by one-step sulfidation of Zn/In-MOFs. The as-synthesized microtubular structured Zn–In–S exhibited high surface area(107.61–127.26 m2/g), high porosity(0.25–0.52 cm3 g−1) and high degradation rate(≥86%) towards tetracycline within 120 min. Moreover, the photoelectric properties and photocatalytic performance were dependent on the existence of Zn species. Particularly, the optimized hollow microtubular ZnS/ZnIn2S4 composites exhibited ultrahigh photocatalytic degradation rate (>90%) within 1 h solar light irradiation. The kinetic constant reached 0.0379 min−1, which was 2.96, 2.02, and 5.65 times higher than In2S3, ZnIn2S4, and ZnS respectively. The ultrahigh photocatalytic degradation efficiency originated from the formation of direct Z scheme heterojunction between ZnIn2S4 and ZnS. The unique heterojunction enabled the effective separation of electron-hole pairs and the production of highly reactive oxidants (•OH, •O2 −, h+). Density functional theory(DFT) demonstrated a higher charge density near the Fermi level and higher affinity towards O2 molecules, which contributed to the efficient interfacial charge mobility and O2 activation.

Dye removal using absorption and photocatalytic properties has been the subject of various fundamental researches. Graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) as a photocatalyst is a good choice because of its many excellent features, like adjustable optical band gap and excellent chemical and thermal stability. Although this catalyst has great potential to eliminate contamination, its use is limited because of the low separation of excited carriers. Therefore, modifying the existing graphitic carbon nitride photocatalyst is necessary to improve its properties and overcome the drawbacks.

The ferrous addition with different dosages has different effects on the phosphorus (P), nitrogen (N) and other properties in the freshwater ecosystem with submerged macrophyte growth. The ferrous addition can affect the nitrogen cycling of water and sediments significantly by affecting the functional bacteria related to the nitrogen cycling in rhizosphere sediment. The genera related to denitrification (e.g., Thiobacillus), ammonification (e.g., Chitinophaga) and nitrification (e.g., Nitrospira) were enriched with the ferrous addition above 0.5 mg/L.

Therefore, this study selected the seven major river basins in China as the study area and comprehensively assessed the changes in ecosystem service importance (ESI) within different basins in the MDG and SDG periods based on six ecosystem services, including habitat quality, soil conservation, water yield, carbon storage, grain production, and aesthetic landscape. Specifically, the changes from 2000 to 2015 and 2015 to 2020 were used to represent MDG and SDG periods, respectively. The results showed that the overall ESI of the seven major river basins showed an increasing trend in both periods, and the proportion of extremely important basins reached 20.39% in 2020, mostly distributed in the Yangtze River basin and the Pearl River basin.

This study used a two-part research approach to assess the feasibility of biosolids-derived fertiliser in the current market and to gauge the extent to which retail consumers value carbon sequestration features in fertilisers. First, a hedonic price analysis of existing fertilisers in the market explored consumer preferences and whether they currently pay extra for “sustainable” or “organic-certified” products. Second, a discrete choice experiment was designed to elicit consumers’ willingness-to-pay for biosolids-derived fertilisers and those clearly labelled with their carbon sequestration capability. The hedonic price analysis determined that organic or natural fertilisers sell at similar or slightly higher prices than synthetic alternatives. The choice experiment revealed that consumers would pay 17% more for fertilisers labelled with their carbon capture capacity. Purchasers of organic fertilisers perceived biosolids-derived fertilisers as valuable organic alternatives. In contrast, buyers of synthetic fertilisers were willing to pay slightly less for biosolids-derived alternatives. These findings suggest that some consumers are willing to purchase biosolids-derived fertilisers at prices comparable to current alternatives and place higher value on fertilisers offering environmental benefits, such as carbon sequestration.

Despite the THP benefits the pre-treatment increases the concentrations of nutrients and melanoidins in the digestate reject water after dewatering. The increased concentrations of nutrients and melanoidins formed during THP-AD can impact downstream processes, such as struvite precipitation and partial nitritation/anammox (PN/A). In our present work, six full-scale PN/A influents and effluents were sampled in The Netherlands (4 with THP and 2 without THP). Full-scale samples were characterised and the stoichiometric O2 consumption and melanoidins chelated to trace elements were analysed. The results showed that THP increased the concentration of total ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN), chemical oxygen demand (COD), total organic carbon (TOC), UVA 254 and colour, which are indicators of melanoidins occurrence. THP furthermore decreased the stoichiometric NO3 −-N production from the PN/A reaction in effluents. The disparity between stoichiometric and measured NO3 − -N in the THP-using plants was explained by the proliferation of denitrifiers. Moreover, denitrification improved the N removal efficiency due to the consumption of the stoichiometrically-produced NO3 − -N. Also, the stoichiometric O2 consumption increased in the plants using THP, reaching up to 56% of the O2 used for partial oxidation of TAN. Trace elements analysis revealed that the plants with elevated concentrations of melanoidins in the effluent showed a high percentage of chelated multivalent cations, particularly transition metals such as Fe. Kendall correlation coefficient analysis showed that the chelation of multivalent cations was correlated mainly with colour occurrence in the reject waters.

The TOC and TN concentrations and C/N ratios show an overall upward increase in the three cores. The TOC and TN deposition rates were relatively high during 1954–1962, decreased to the lowest rates during 1963–1972, and generally increased thereafter. Anthropogenic sources associated with agriculture were the dominant factor in the up-core increases in TOC and TN concentrations, although natural sources were the main contributor to TOC and TN deposition. The temporal changes in TOC and TN deposition rates were mainly due to the sediment yield rather than anthropogenic sources associated with agriculture. The changes in TOC and TN concentrations with depth, and temporal changes in the TOC and TN deposition rates determined from the three cores, reflect the temporal patterns of sediment TOC and TN trapping in the small reservoir over the past ∼60 years. Sediment yield exerted a greater effect on the TOC and TN deposition in the studied reservoir, as compared with a previously reported reservoir within a small agricultural limestone catchment, and the different results of the two studies originated from the contrasting lithologies in the two catchments. Moreover, a comparison with data obtained for a previously studied large reservoir suggests that differences in TOC and TN deposition (including concentrations, specific deposition rates, and temporal trends in deposition rates) are related to catchment size, and the comparison highlights the characteristic patterns of TOC and TN trapping in the small and large reservoirs. The present findings improve our understanding of the temporal patterns of sediment TOC and TN trapping in a small reservoir within a typical agricultural granite catchment in terms of environmental changes influenced by human activity. This study also enhances our knowledge of the barrier effects of a dam on the downstream transport of TOC and TN in a small catchment in a non-karst setting, and the redistribution of sediment TOC and TN in a large river, which can help guide strategies for water resource management on the river basin-scale.

However, existing research mainly focuses on individual sectors or specific aspects of WEC and lacks a thorough comprehension of the link among them, especially in the full supply network. This study creates a multi-model evaluation technique to estimate the WEC network across various sectors and provinces in order to close this gap. Specifically, WEC multiregional input-output analysis including 42 industrial sectors and coupling coordination degree models is proposed to further analyze the interaction relationship among WEC. The results indicate that the implied carbon footprint is positively correlated with virtual water and implied energy, but the WEC footprint is negatively correlated with the external footprint. The energy-carbon correlation is the strongest relationship, followed by the energy-water correlation. In addition, the WEC coupled network shows an extreme disorder state, while it decreases from developed areas to less developed areas. The transfer of WEC is dominated by industries with higher consumption coefficients. This phenomenon also exists in the WEC flow in provinces. From less developed to more developed places, there is a considerable influx of WEC. The multi-model evaluation method proposed in our study could be applied by governments to estimate the WEC coupled network, compare it with other regions, and analyze the potential effects of environmental policies.

Nontargeted identification of DBPs precursors from SMPs in municipal secondary effluent was explored in the present research. The hydrophobic (HPO) fraction that constituted the major portion of the SMPs was 48.0%, and the majority of organic SMPs were composed of low molecular weight (LMW) compounds. The results showed that the HPO fraction with MW < 1 kDa component has the highest disinfection by-product formation potentials (DBPFPs). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results showed that the HPO fraction with MW < 1 kDa component was mainly composed of OC–OH (40.2%) and amide/peptide N (46.7%) functional groups. This finding was in line with the results showing the highest yields of DBPFPs in terms of HAAs (haloacetic acids) and trichloroacetamide (TCAcAm). Ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-ToF-MS) data revealed that phospholipids, fatty acids, fatty acyls-fatty amides, phosphatidylcholine, glycosides, fatty acid esters, glycolipid, and steroids were the main chemical classes in SMPs. Among these chemical classes, phospholipids containing amino acids structures and fatty acids containing carboxyl functional groups with the maximum abundance could promote the formation of HAAs. This research offers a thorough characterization of SMPs derived from municipal secondary effluent. These results enable the implementation of targeted methods to decrease the formation of DBPs by identifying potential precursors of DBPs.

Hence, a novel MP trap with abundant oxime groups (MOF-545-oxime) was triumphantly synthesized based on MOF-545 post-engineering. The supreme MP adsorption capacity of MOF-545-oxime was 294.6 mg/g, which also manifested excellent selectivity and reusability for MP adsorption. Moreover, the kinetic, isothermal and thermodynamic models were used to inquiry the MP adsorption mechanism, which was governed by electrostatic attraction, coordination, and π–π interactions. The XPS spectra and adsorption energy calculations upheld the CN–OH and CN groups executed a pivotal part in the MP adsorption process of MOF-545-oxime. MOF-545-oxime also possessed splendid anti-biofouling activity and environmental safety, which efficaciously diminished the pessimistic influences of Halamphora upon the MP adsorption capacity and complied with the requirements for non-toxicity and innocuousness in the adsorbent application. The superb anti-biofouling activity and environmental safety of MOF-545-oxime might be due to the abundant functional groups and stable chemical structure. Indubitably, the development of efficacious adsorbents is crucial for the MP removal from aquatic systems. The originally proposed MOF-545-oxime has a great potential to remove MPs from aquatic systems, which also offers an inspiration for perfect high-efficiency adsorbents.

There are few researches on the accumulation mechanism of fluoride in mine water. In this study, 71 water samples and 39 rock samples were collected from 9 mines of the Inner Shaanxi-Mongolia Contiguous area for chemical analyses and laboratory experiments. Results indicate that the concentration of F− in mine water increased with the gradual increase of the coal mining depth. The average concentration of F− in no.3-1 coal mine water is higher than that in no.2-2 coal mine water. And concentrations of F− exceed the China national standard for drinking water quality (upper limit of 1 mg/L), which is closely related to fluoride in the no.3-1 coal roof groundwater and water-rock interaction in the goaf. The main hydrogeochemical processes include mineral dissolution (fluorapatite and hornblende), desorption of exchangeable F− from clay minerals (mica, illite, kaolinite and chlorite) and cation exchange between Ca2+ and Na+. Furthermore, long-term further water–rock interactions result in F− accumulation in mine water. Alkaline environments, decreased particle size of rock, and increased temperature all favor release of F− from clay mineral surface into mine water. Finally, conceptual model of high-fluoride mine water was first proposed, and the formation of high-fluoride mine water can be summed as two stages including water-rock interaction in groundwater and secondary water-rock interaction in goaf. This study helps to improve our understanding of genesis of high-fluoride mine water and our capability of predicting the future concentration, which may provide foundation for manage and utilization of mine water.

However, the dangerous flow patterns and blockage accidents caused by hydrates threaten the safety and efficiency of the transportation process. A mutual interaction exists between hydrate growth and multiphase flow. In this study, hydrate formation and gas–slurry two–phase flow tests were conducted in a pure water system with a constant pressure (4 MPa) and various liquid loadings (40–80%) in a visual flow loop. It was found that the hydrate growth process in the dynamic system included bubble promotion, subcooling promotion, and mass transfer inhibition. Meanwhile, two atypical slug patterns (rapid conversion slug and deposition slug) in the vertical upward flow were determined, which corresponded to the promotion and inhibition regions. In the rapid conversion slug flow, the churn segments replaced the original Taylor bubbles when the liquid loading was less than 60%. In the deposition slug flow, slurry shedding phenomena was observed. In addition, the hydrate particle deposition behavior was found to inhibit hydrate growth and cause flow pattern shifts, but did not trigger the differential pressure surge. The gas isolation caused by the liquid plug and energy dissipation due to the collision between hydrate particles and the tube wall may be responsible for the sudden increase in pressure drop. Furthermore, the feasibility of predicting hydrate blockage using the differential pressure method was explored. The experiment results showed that this warning method was effective when the liquid loading was below 76%. And an effective warning can improve the transport capacity by approximately 34%.

However, there is still uncertainty regarding consumption-based water footprint (CWF) assessment across different spatiotemporal scales, especially those differentiated by green, blue, and grey water footprints. To address this knowledge gap, this study employed a multi-regional input–output (MRIO) model and structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to quantify the spatiotemporal dynamics and key drivers of consumption-based green (GCWF), blue (BCWF), and grey (HCWF) water footprints in mainland China during 2012–2017. The main findings of the study are as follows. (1) The HCWF is approximately 4.4 times greater than the sum of the GCWF and BCWF, with water consumption caused by pollution significantly exceeding direct consumption. However, there was a significant decrease in all three CWFs after 2015, particularly HCWF. (2) The spatial distribution pattern of the CWF shows high values in the east and south and low values in the west and north, while virtual water (VW) transfer through commodity trade occurs mainly from inland to coastal regions. (3) The three highest water-consuming sectors were agriculture, food and tobacco processing, and construction, accounting for over 70% of the total water consumption. (4) Water efficiency and consumption patterns are crucial factors in reducing CWF, while affluence levels have the greatest impact on increasing CWF, followed by changes in industrial structure after 2015. Overall, the results of this study contribute to a comprehensive understanding of China's regional and sectoral water consumption throughout the supply chain. In addition, our findings identified regions and sectors with high water consumption and their drivers, which can inform policy decisions and contribute to synergistic cross-regional regulation and sustainable water resources management.

This study focused on an artificial lake-river system in Shanghai featuring a spiderweb-structure, it is expected to detect whether the tributaries in such a system made a protective and buffering effect on the lake under the impact of rainfall runoff. A hydrodynamic model was established using MIKE 21, one of the most widely used software which can conduct two-dimensional modeling of water quality changes in surface water, to simulate the changes of total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP), the key indicators causing lake eutrophication, under different rainfall events. The results showed that, under various conditions, storm events almost have no first or final effect on the central lake, TN and TP in the lake were improved by 5%–18% and 1%–12% among monitoring stations. However, Obvious negative effects were displayed in the water quality of radial – circular tributaries, and the first effects in circular tributaries were more serious than those on the radial because their difference in hydrological condition. With the increase of rainfall intensity, the peak value of the pollutant concentration in circular rivers increased 63%–185% as compared with the initial. As to final effects, some circular rivers were significantly impacted, and the pollutant concentration increased by approximately 40% in the seventh day as rainfall started. It was deduced that tributaries played as protective buffer against pollutants in this spiderweb water system, in that pollutants would be degraded in such dense spiderweb-structured river systems before entering the central lake, and rainfall runoff would also accelerate the flow in rivers and lakes. Therefore, the paper hold that, the central lake could not be separated from the radial – circular tributaries, and the officially planned pumps and sluices in the river estuaries would not be recommended. This study would provide technical support for the planning, construction and ecological protection of artificial urban lake-river system in similar areas.

This study presents a systematic in-situ remediation case by hydraulic circulation in petroleum hydrocarbon-contaminated groundwater in a historically industrial-used site in China. Lab-scale experiments of soil column leaching and in-situ remediation trials were conducted to show the effectiveness of this technology. It has been found that through regulation and optimization of operational measures in five stages, the clean-up goal (1140 μg/L) of the targeted contaminant in groundwater based on the former risk assessment of human health and the intervention value (600 μg/L) in the ‘Dutch Target and Intervention Values (2000)’ were both achieved, and the tailing rebound effect of traditional pump-and-treatment technology was well solved. The combination of groundwater monitoring by ways of pumping pipelines and groundwater monitoring wells could enable workers to timely and effectively grasp the temporal and spatial dynamic variation of pollutants in groundwater in response to the restoration activities, which played an important role in improving the pertinence of pumping-and-injection measures and efficiency of the hydraulic circulation. Discharge standards of wastewater can be reached after being treated with the mass content of added coagulants (Ferrous sulfate) reaching 0.4 g/L and adsorbents (activated carbon) reaching 0.2 g/L.

However, knowledge of the potential effects of different irrigation strategies coupled with nitrogen applications on groundwater under intensive agricultural practices remains a critical issue and a grand challenge due to the long transit time for NO3–N across the thick vadose zone. To close this knowledge gap, the calibrated RZWQM2 model was used to investigate long-term (1970–2070) water and NO3–N dynamics in the vadose zone and the potential threat of NO3–N pollution on groundwater under different irrigation strategies (35% of total available water-triggered, 100% filled irrigation (I35% TAW), 90-mm irrigation (I90 mm), and 150-mm irrigation (I150 mm)) and nitrogen applications (optimal and conventional high rates) for the maize-wheat rotation system in the Jinghui Canal irrigation area of the Guanzhong Plain in China. Results showed that mean groundwater recharge values were 43, 65, and 271 mm yr−1 under the I35% TAW, I90 mm, and I150 mm scenarios, respectively, with no significant effect on crop yields. Accumulated NO3–N was concentrated at the 10-m depth over the past 50 years and would be deeply transported to the 15-m and 20-m depths under the I35% TAW and I90 mm strategies, respectively, in the future 50 years. Accumulated NO3–N was concentrated uniformly at the 30-m depth for the I150 mm scenario, with NO3–N amounts of 85.8 and 26.9 kg ha−1 yr−1 leached into the groundwater (30 m) under the conventional and optimal nitrogen applications. Although groundwater at 8–10 m faced the risk of NO3–N pollution during the past 50 years, and groundwater at the deeper depths of 15–20 m could be threatened in the next 50 years under the I35% TAW and I90 mm strategies, the annual amount of NO3–N leaching into groundwater could be significantly reduced from 68.9 to 71.8 kg ha−1 to 10.3–12.7 kg ha−1 by applying more optimal amounts of nitrogen. The results of this study provide a straightforward understanding of long-term spatial and temporal characteristics of water and NO3–N in the vadose zone, and provide insight into possible methods for controlling irrigation application amounts that would prevent groundwater pollution from NO3–N in irrigated areas.

Previous studies have preliminarily verified that there is a coupling relationship between tourism urbanization and human settlement environment. However, whether tourism urbanization can effectively improve human settlement environment, especially in the most vulnerable watershed area in China, the Yellow River Basin, is still unclear. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to explore the degree and direction of the impact of tourism urbanization on human settlement environment in 78 prefecture-level cities in the Yellow River Basin from 2005 to 2019 under the influence of nonlinear and spatial spillover effects. This paper uses the PSTR (panel smooth transition regression) model SDM (spatial Durbin) model to reveal the following results: First, tourism urbanization can significantly improve human settlement environment in the Yellow River Basin. After crossing the second threshold (0.434), the nonlinear effect of tourism urbanization on human settlement environment is the strongest, but only a very small number of cities cross the threshold. Secondly, the improvement of the level of tourism urbanization has effectively improved production environment and living environment of the region, but it has had a significant negative impact on ecological environment of the region. Finally, the combined effect of regional geographical proximity and economic interaction is conducive to the positive spatial spillover effect of tourism urbanization on production environment and living environment of surrounding areas of the Yellow River Basin. The current empirical results reveal the key role of tourism urbanization in improving human settlement environment in the Yellow River Basin, and clearly outline that the development of tourism urbanization should be consistent with the national strategy of ecological protection and high-quality development in the Yellow River Basin.

The purpose of this study was to carry out a multifactor coupling orthogonal experiment of irrigation, nitrogen and biochar in the soybean growing season in 2021 and 2022 via plot treatment, linking the effect of irrigation and nitrogen on soybean yield with the carbon sequestration and emission reduction properties of biochar. A dynamic regulation model with multi-dimensional objective synergy for soybean yield, water footprint (WF), carbon footprint (CFP), water use efficiency (WUE) and partial productivity of nitrogen fertilizer (PFPN) based on the comprehensive regulation framework of experimental-simulation-optimization was constructed. This model was used to explore the optimal irrigation, nitrogen and biochar application patterns and their synergistic effects on yield and environmental benefits. The results showed that soybean yield and PFPN were affected by irrigation, nitrogen application affected WF and WUE, and biochar application affected CFP. Irrigation significantly affected the soil water content and consequently the WF while enhancing the crop yield and PFPN. Compared to the I1 treatment, the I0 treatment reduced water consumption, and the addition of nitrogen (N0 and N1) contributed to higher crop yields and WUE. The addition of biochar significantly increased crop yield, WUE and PFPN while mitigating the impact of nitrogen fertilizer application on greenhouse gas emissions. Based on the three-factor interaction, the yield, WF, CFP, WUE, and PFPN in 2022 increased by 3.03%, 3.51%, 2.17%, 1.59%, and 7.61%, respectively, compared to those in 2021. In addition, combined with water and nitrogen application, biochar application reduced CFP while increasing soybean yield, WUE and PFPN. A multiobjective optimization model demonstrated that when the amounts of irrigation, nitrogen, and biochar in 2021 and 2022 were 178.4 mm, 104.6 kg/hm2, and 8650.8 kg/hm2 and 153.7 mm, 93.7 kg/hm2, and 8063.4 kg/hm2, respectively, the synthetic degrees of yield, WF, CFP, WUE, and PFPN reached 0.866 and 0.872, respectively. The coordinated regulation of irrigation, nitrogen, and biochar reached a high-quality coordinated level that was 14.39% and 7.13% higher in 2021 and 2022 than the best I0N0B1 treatment, respectively. In this study, a combination of experiment-simulation-optimization is used to propose optimal irrigation, nitrogen and biochar regulation methods that synergize soybean yield, resource use efficiency and environmental benefits, which are of theoretical value for promoting green and efficient soybean production in black soil areas.

While many studies analyzed the structure of water use, few analyzed the diversification and concentration characteristics of sophisticated water use sectors classifications. This study quantified the diversification and concentration indicators (diversification index, dominance and evenness) of water use structure based on the water use data of nine water use sectors in all provinces of China from 2001 to 2020, revealed the characteristics of diversification and concentration evolution of water use structure in each province of China, constructed water use structure influence factors and factor sets, and identified the drivers of water use structure evolution using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index model. The main results are as follows: (1) the water use structures varied greatly between provinces, with provinces with high levels of economic and social development having more complex water use structures and a higher degree of diversification; (2) from 2001 to 2020, the major water use sectors controlled the water use structure to a lesser extent and the water use structure tended to be diversified and uniform; (3) economic development was the main driving factor of water use structure changes in China, and each province could adjust its industrial structure according to the local water resources endowment conditions to optimize its water use structure. (4) compared to the four traditional water use sectors used in previous studies, the nine water use sectors used in this study better reflected the evolution characteristics of regional water use structures.

Yet it is not clear how virtual groundwater transfer through inter-provincial and international trades contributes to distant groundwater overexploitation over a period of time. This analysis traces groundwater abstraction from overexploited regions of China incorporated in the complete supply chain to final consumption, and examines drivers for dynamic changes of virtual groundwater transfers between 2007 and 2017 using the structural decomposition analysis. Groundwater use in four overexploited regions (i.e. North China Plain, Northeast China, hinterland North China and Xinjiang) were 88–91 billion m3 (about 85%–88% of national groundwater withdrawal). Inter-provincial virtual groundwater transfer presented an increasing trend with its share of total groundwater withdrawal increased from 36.4% to 45.4%, indicating an increasing reliance of regional final consumption on groundwater use beyond province boundaries. Structural decomposition analysis revealed that increasing receipt of commodities from overexploited regions was a major contributor to increasing reliance on virtual groundwater. Improved water use efficiency and consumption structure offset increasing virtual groundwater transfers from overexploited regions. The understanding gained in this study can be used by water managers and policy makers to improve the governance and management of groundwater resources.

In this study, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model and an analytical model for air entrainment were used to investigate how different flow deflector designs influence TDG production. Specifically, an evaluation was conducted to assess the influence of various flow deflector designs and installation positions within the spillways at the Hugh Keenleyside Dam, B.C, Canada, on both the production of TDG supersaturation and energy dissipation. Model results indicate that the CFD model incorporating an air entrainment model reliably predicts the production of TDG supersaturation. While the installation of a straight submerged deflector can successfully reduce TDG production by up to 16%, it also results in a significant decrease in energy dissipation rate, which can be up to 25%. After installing baffle blocks below water surface, the production of TDG supersaturation can be decreased by about 9%, with little decrease of energy dissipation (7%). The effectiveness of flow deflectors in enhancing energy dissipation and reducing TDG production depends on their depth placement, with optimal results achieved at a specific depth below the water surface. Nevertheless, beyond this depth, both TDG production and energy dissipation exhibit a significant decline. This study provides an advanced tool capable of accurately predicting TDG production under different operational conditions and mitigative alternatives. Results from this study offer insights for spillway design or retrofitting to optimize the mitigation of TDG supersaturation while maintaining energy dissipation.

Traditional centralized UDS have been found ineffective in mitigating the uncertainty of future flood risks. Consequently, the need to explore resilient alternatives, such as decentralized UDS, has gained importance. Of particular interest is the coupled approach of grey infrastructure (GREI) and low-impact development (LID), which merges the drainage capabilities of GREI with the versatility and sustainability of distributed green infrastructure. However, there are limited studies assessing the environmental and economic impacts of both centralized and decentralized LID-GREI UDS using integrated Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) methods. This study, using Zhujiang New Town, Guangzhou, China, as a case study, found that decentralized UDS outperformed centralized UDS from both environmental and economic perspectives, mainly due to smaller pipeline scale and lower maintenance frequency. Furthermore, though the LID-GREI UDS showcased more substantial environmental impacts and higher economic costs compared to GREI UDS, the hydrological benefits obtained from LID operation can counteract part of these environmental impacts. In a unique perspective, this study considers the payback periods for centralized and decentralized LID-GREI UDS, estimating them to be 70 and 55 years respectively, when taking economic implications and hydrologic benefits into an overall consideration. Overall, the findings underscore that the LID-GREI UDS, particularly the decentralized LID-GREI, presents a more sustainable and cost-effective strategy for mitigating pluvial flooding compared to GREI UDS. This study provides comprehensive insights into effective and cost-efficient strategies for alleviating urban flooding vulnerabilities through UDS design and implementation.

However, the mechanisms influencing variations in PUE and SWUE warrant further investigation due to existing research gaps. The gross primary productivity (GPP) and net primary productivity (NPP) in China were simulated using the TL-LUE model and improved CASA model, respectively. PUE and SWUE were then calculated in conjunction with precipitation and soil water data. A further investigation was conducted on the joint evolutionary patterns of PUE and SWUE. The impact of factors such as climate change, vegetation variation, carbon dioxide emission, and human activities on PUE and SWUE was separately identified using partial derivatives and elasticity coefficients. The results suggest an insignificant downward in PUE and a significant upward trend in SWUE in China from the period of 2000–2018. Notably, drought mitigation in the arid zone led to a steeper decrease in PUE compared to humid, sub-humid and semi-arid zones. Drought mitigation resulted in a decrease of SWUE in arid zones, yet an increase in humid, sub-humid and semi-arid zones. The correlations between vegetation change and precipitation and PUE or SWUE, respectively, were predominantly influenced by changes in drought conditions. NPP and precipitation collectively dominated the alterations in PUE, contributing 41.55% and −58.45%, respectively. However, GPP exerted a more substantial influence on SWUE compared to precipitation, with notable contributions of 93.93% and −6.07%, respectively. The contributions to PUE from climate variation, human activities, vegetation change and carbon dioxide were −57%, 30%, 12% and −1%, respectively. Simultaneously, the contributions to SWUE from these same factors appeared as 20%, 63%, 16% and 1%, respectively. This study intends to augment the comprehension of the influence exerted by global climate change and human activities on the correlation between carbon and water in terrestrial vegetation ecosystems.

Therefore, policy analysis not only needs to examine the effectiveness of these policies from the point of view of economic components but also, in a more comprehensive view, should assess the impact of these policies on other aspects like sustainability. In this study, an integrated Positive Mathematical Programming (PMP) and System Dynamics (SD) model was developed to investigate the effects of the agricultural policy reform on the cultivation pattern and water resources sustainability in the Doroodzan Dam basin in Fars Province, southern Iran, where managing water resources is a seriously challenging due to population growth and periodic drought. The initial investigation involved analyzing how price policies (guaranteed price and world price of crops) and non-price policies (removal of subsidy payments to agricultural inputs and improvement of irrigation efficiency) impacted the cropping pattern. The results of the study showed that the most significant decrease in cropland area occurs due to the removal of agricultural input subsidies. Although this crop pattern can lead to environmental sustainability, it is not considered from the point of view of food self-sufficiency. Based on the results, applying world prices increase cropping area for crops like rice, which is a water-intensive crop. Another point was the high priority of onions, fodder corn, and beans while they are not subjected to governmental pricing intervention. This may indicate the extent of public policies' impact on agriculture. Although under some policy scenarios changes in the gross margin or cropping area do not sound significant, the water-saving nature of these policies is more compelling. Finally, the impact of altering cropping patterns along with climate change and population growth on water indices was assessed using SD modeling. Thus, reforming the government's policies in the agricultural sector may help reduce the water shortage index in the basin. The policy of removing subsidies for the agricultural inputs led to the attainment of the lowest water shortage index.

Unlike conventional oily sludge dewatering methods, EDW eliminates the need for chemical additives, mitigating the risk of secondary contamination. This study comprehensively investigates the impacts of voltage and coal-powdered activated carbon (CPAC) on the performance of EDW, as well as the properties of the dewatered sludge cake. Moreover, the underlying EDW mechanism is delved into the exploration. The water content decreased from 79.01% to 63.25% with the application of 40 V and 25 kPa pressure, while the dewatering rate increased from 0.025 g/s to 0.055 g/s, with the best electro-dewatering performance. Furthermore, the incorporation of CPAC significantly optimized the electro-dewatering performance, by reducing the viscosity, electrical resistance of the sludge cake and created more mechanical channels for water migration. Introducing 7.5% CPAC (wt.%) achieved the highest dewatering rate of 0.078 g/s with 57.14% final water content of sludge cake. The EDW process enabled discharge of heavy metal ions from oily sludge cake. Additionally, the addition of CPAC contributed to reduced unit energy consumption and improved calorific value of oily sludge cake.

However, once installed, LID facilities often suffer from a lack of maintenance, resulting in impaired functionality and substantial wastage of financial resource. Since 2014, many LID facilities have been constructed in Chinese pilot sponge cities. However, to date, there is little knowledge about the post-construction status of these LID facilities. In response, we investigated the current status quo, common problems needing maintenance, and residents’ attitudes towards maintenance of LID facilities. The results showed that, among 467 bio-retention facilities in three surveyed pilot sponge cities, approximately one third of the bio-retention facilities were in a good state; However, more than one thirds are facing issues of decreasing vegetation coverage rate, a deteriorating vegetation growth situation, and the slight silting or blocking of water inlets or overflow ports. Thus, regular maintenance is necessary, but the starting maintenance time can go through in the fifth year after construction.

The Chl-a concentrations exhibit significant temporal fluctuations and are strongly influenced by several environmental factors, including water physicochemical parameters and landscape patterns. Although the impacts of these factors on Chl-a concentrations in lakes and reservoirs have been extensively studied, there is little knowledge of eutrophication in ponds. In this context, the Chl-a concentrations and other water physicochemical parameters, namely pH, water temperature (WT), transparency, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and chemical oxygen demand (COD), were monitored monthly in 28 subtropical ponds in Central China in 2019. The trophic state index (TSI) was applied to evaluate the eutrophication levels of the ponds. Multivariate statistical analysis was used to quantify the relationships between the water physicochemical parameters, landscape patterns, and Chl-a concentrations. According to the obtained results, all 28 ponds were classified as hypereutrophic in June, as well as moderate eutrophic and hypereutrophic levels in May, July, and August. Temporal clustering analysis classified the study period (12 months) into three distinct temporal clusters, with different nutrient levels of the ponds in clusters. Among the water physicochemical parameters, TP explained more than 50% of the Chl-a concentration variations during the entire study period. The partial least squares-structural equation model (PLS-SEM) results indicated that the Chl-a concentrations were controlled by TP from June to August, and jointly limited by TP and TN in the remaining months. Landscape patterns indirectly affected the Chl-a concentrations by affecting the pond water TN and TP concentrations. The orchard area, pond area, Shannon's diversity index, numbers of patches, and landscape shape index were significant landscape pattern metrics, showing different contribution rates to the variations in the Chl-a concentrations of the identified temporal clusters.

This study focuses on the “Red and Black List”, a typical informal institution in China's ongoing Rural Toilet Revolution, which is built on an emerging social credit system in rural China that punishes negative behaviors using blacklists while rewards positive behaviors using redlists. Based on the survey data of 1820 rural households, this study uses the endogenous switching regression (ESR) model to quantify the impact of the “Red and Black List” on household sanitation behaviors (hygiene management, toilet maintenance and effluents recycling). The results show that households in the villages adopting the “Red and Black List” are 11.63%, 20.89% and 29.35% more likely to perform well in hygiene management, toilet maintenance and effluents recycling respectively. Such treatment effects are greater in the villages adopting the “Red and Black List” with material rewards. Moreover, the implementation of the “Red and Black List” significantly increases regular monitoring activities, professional codes provision and households' emotional affinity through which informal institutions could possibly promote desirable sanitation behaviors. Based on these findings, the policy recommendation is that informal institutions on sanitation should be established in local governments to contribute to the success of sanitation campaigns.

Industrial tomato processing, a prominent segment within the food processing industry, consumes substantial amounts of water and energy which are interconnected each other through various processing stages. A systematic approach characterizing the water and energy flows and their link in tomato processing helps to understand how these resources are used in tomato processing and what opportunities exist for improving efficiency. This enable decision makers to implement tailored strategies for water and energy conservation, and waste management enabling to enhance both efficiency and sustainability in tomato processing. This review provides a comprehensive description of the processing lines involved in tomato processing, with a specific focus on the key steps impacting water and energy consumption as well as waste generation. Furthermore, it proposes a quantitative methodological approach based on water-energy nexus (WEN) assessment, which establishes baselines and identifies opportunities for improving resource efficiency. The review also explores a range of conventional and novel measures and technologies for water conservation, energy recovery, and efficiency across the various stages of tomato processing. It delves into their advantages and limitations, offering insights into their applicability within the industry. By examining these approaches, the review aims to provide valuable guidance for stakeholders in the tomato processing industry seeking to optimize resource utilization, reduce environmental impact, and improve overall sustainability.";"2023-11-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623031542";"15";"Water Other"

While access to sufficient water is key for appropriate fish farming, there are various methodological gaps when assessing quantitative water use (QWU). This study discusses the status of QWU in finfish aquaculture in depth and contributes to the understanding of the different QWU methodologies currently used in this field within the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) framework. A systematic literature review following the Protocol, Search, Appraisal, Synthesis, Analysis, and Report (PSALSAR) methodology was conducted, to evaluate the available scientific literature (January 2009–March 2022) of LCA studies intertwined with QWU of finfish aquaculture and associated fish processing. A total of 22 articles (80 treatments) were included and classified based on their fish production systems, LCA characteristics, and aquaculture intensity (using the Aquaculture Production Intensity Scale - APIS score). Four QWU methodologies were reported: water dependence (WD, 15 studies), AWARE (3 studies), Water Footprint Assessment (WFA, 2 studies), and consumptive water use (CWU,2). Comparison of results from these methodologies is challenging due to different technical approaches assessing water use quantities. For instance, AWARE, WFA and CWU account for water consumption, whereas WD accounts for all the water reared into a system, regardless of it being returned to the sourced watershed or not. WD can be used for fresh, brackish or seawater, whereas the other methodologies account exclusively for freshwater. WD and AWARE consider only blue water, WFA includes green, grey and/or blue water, and CWU considers green and/or blue. Moreover, WD and CWU are inventory methodologies, AWARE is midpoint, and WFA can be inventory or midpoint methodology. QWU method development for aquaculture, which is a complex system with diverse water requirements, is much needed. This study highlights future research needs in QWU in aquaculture, to help standardize the QWU methodologies used in aquaculture and facilitate the implementation of water management practices for both direct and indirect water usage, which are key for achieving sustainable aquaculture.";"2023-11-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623031670";"7";"Water Other"

To assess the applicability of the eight selected global climate models (GCMs), four single indicators and one comprehensive indicator were calculated at multiple stations. According to the evaluation results, a weighted multimode ensemble was established. To downscale and correct the deviation from the meteorological data while maintaining the trend signal, the enhanced Delta-DCSI technique was utilized. Eventually, the corrected GCM data were used to drive the SWAT model to simulate the spatial and temporal changes in the soil water content in the Luanhe River Basin under future scenarios. The results indicated that (1) the SWAT model was suitable for and capable of simulating hydrological processes in the basin; (2) the SWAT model can be accurately driven by multimodel ensemble data after model optimization; (3) the soil water content in the basin slowly increased and fluctuated over time; and (4) in the future, lower soil water contents will occur in a few northern subbasins, and consistently higher water contents will occur in the remaining areas.

However, the implementation of irrational water and fertilizer regimes in greenhouse vegetable fields (GVF) has resulted in adverse environmental impacts. Therefore, it is crucial to develop water and fertilizer regimes to maintain the productivity of greenhouse vegetables with less carbon (C) and reactive nitrogen (Nr) footprint. A four growing seasons experiment involving the cultivation of cucumbers and tomatoes was conducted in the suburbs of Beijing. The experiment comprised three treatments: flood irrigation with a conventional urea-N application (FN), drip fertigation with a conventional urea-N application (DN), and drip fertigation with a 50% reduction of urea-N application (DRN). The results showed that about 70% of annual N inputs in GVF were surplus, posing a high risk of loss. For the FN treatment, the N budget, Nr loss, Nr footprint per unit of vegetable yield (NrFY), Nr footprint per unit of net return (NrFR), greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, C footprint per unit of vegetable yield (CFY), C footprint per unit of net return (CFR) were respectively quantified as follows: 1653 kg N ha−1 yr−1, 776 kg N ha−1 yr−1, 4.39 kg N t−1 yr−1, 24.48 kg N ¥10000−1 yr−1, 46548 kg CO2-eq ha−1 yr−1, 262.98 kg CO2-eq t−1 yr−1 and 1467.58 kg CO2-eq ¥10000−1 yr−1. Compared with FN, DN significantly reduced Nr loss (25%), NrFY (24%), NrFR (22%), GHG emissions (6%), CFY (4%), while it increased N surplus (9.7%) and produced lower farmers' net return (¥ 13486 ha−1 yr−1). Concurrently, DRN significantly reduced the N surplus, Nr loss, NrFY and NrFR by ∼35%, decreased the GHG emissions, CFY and CFR by ∼20%, and improved farmers' net return by ¥ 674 ha−1 yr−1 compared to FN treatment. Therefore, this study highlighted that an integrated water and fertilizer regulation strategy (drip irrigation replacing flood irrigation coupled with a 50% reduction in chemical N application) can simultaneously achieve environmental and economic benefits in the context of high N inputs. This contributes to the sustainable development of intensive vegetable cultivation systems. ";"2023-10-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623030561";"7";"Water Other"

The notion of Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) presents a paradigm aimed at mitigating waste generation and optimizing resource recovery. However, the implementation of ZLD in the realm of industrial wastewater treatment remains inadequately investigated and researched. We undertook an investigation into a ZLD treatment system applied to coking wastewater within a steel plant, which had been in operation for a span of four years, where the core steps are membrane concentration separation and thermal crystallization. The treatment efficiency of each unit was studied using the method of on-site sampling and detection. In comparison to the initial phase, the separation effectiveness of NF unit on different valence ions demonstrated sustained stability, the average rejection rate of SO4 2− was approximately 96%, whereas the rejection rate of Cl− was near 0. Conversely, under the influence of long-term operation and membrane fouling, the efficiency of the membrane concentration unit had a downward trend, with problems such as the deterioration of membrane, loss of ion rejection capability, and degradation of reclaimed water. The water recovery rate has decreased to 48.9% and the average ion retention rate has decreased to 85% in the membrane concentration unit. Nonetheless, the resultant by-products continued to align with the steel plant's recycling requirements. In addition, the Life cycle Assessment (LCA) method was used to assess environmental impact during operation. Subsequent analysis led to that reagents and electricity consumed in pretreatment and advanced treatment had a significant impact for negative EI. The impact of pretreatment on ODP accounted for 27.64%, and the impact on ADP accounted for 20.72%. The impact of advanced treatment on ADP accounted for 16.25%, the impact on EP accounted for 21.74%, and the impact on ET accounted for 27.06%. Meanwhile, the recovered water and salt during operation generate considerable environmental benefits and dominate the evaluation of the entire operating process. This work furnishes a valuable point of reference for pertinent ZLD investigations, while unveiling the pronounced capacity of ZLD to contribute substantially to waste management and the betterment of environmental consequences.

Given its high energy and water resources interdependence, a framework is needed that can provide both a unified and systematic assessment of these. This study investigates the effects of coupling China's energy tax and water fee policies using a recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model. Several possible scenarios are simulated. The simulation results show that the water fee promotes water conservation, but its effect is limited at China's current water fee level. The energy tax is shown to be more effective in improving water-saving efficiency. Under the maximum energy tax scenario (EH), total energy and industrial water demand fall by 10.45% and 3.82%, respectively, compared with 0.59% and 0.72%, respectively, under the maximum water fee scenario (W8). Furthermore, the energy tax is more conducive to China's energy conservation and CE reduction (CER) targets than the water fee, but raising both energy taxes and water fees can have a significant impact on energy conservation and CER. In the scenario going from a low energy tax (EL) to a high-energy tax (EH), the reduction in primary energy production increases from 8.36% to 19.16%, while CE also drop significantly, going from 5.59% to 16.71%; however, In the scenario going from the low water fee (W2) to the high-water fee (W8), the reduction in primary energy production only changes from 0.24% to 0.43%, and CO2 reduction from 0.35% to 0.61%. Meanwhile, the mixed water-energy scenario shows a spill over effect, with the CE and energy savings management goals requiring less GDP loss than water or energy policies implemented in isolation. Ultimately, the results show that even when combined, relying solely on existing water and energy tax policies will be insufficient to meet China's water-saving targets without other environmental policies. The key to overcoming energy and water constraints is to increase water and energy efficiency year after year. This will enable China to achieve its CER target and the 14th Five-Year Plan water savings target. Thus, the synergistic effect of water conservation and energy saving can be realised simultaneously when the CER and energy consumption structure improve, which is crucial for developing an effective environmental policy strategy.

Horseradish peroxidase (HRP), a heme-containing peroxidase, is capable of catalyzing the oxidative conversion and coupling reaction of phenols in sewage to form polymerization products in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). However, free HRP can only function within a relatively narrow range of temperature and pH conditions, and its excellent water solubility makes it difficult to recover, thereby significantly increasing the cost of enzyme utilization. The immobilized enzyme was prepared by incorporating HRP and self-synthesized UCST (Upper Critical Solution Temperature) and pH dual responsive polymer P(NAGA-b-AA-b-VBA). The loading capacity of HRP reached 295 mg/g while maintaining the UCST performance.

The gray water footprint (GWF) is an important index for evaluating the degradation of the water quality caused by the overuse of cropland. Therefore, evaluating the GWF and analyzing the degradation risk caused by the rapid growth of crops are important ways to measure the sustainable intensification of cropland use. In this study, by using agricultural production panel data at the national level from the China National Agricultural Production database and nitrogen, and phosphorus cycle parameter data from previous studies, we adopted the gray water model and gray water stress to evaluate the GWF and related degradation risk of cropland systems in China from 1990 to 2018. We found that the GWF in China increased fourfold from 1990 to 2018. The GWF increase in southern China was generally lower than that in the northern provinces. GWFs of rice, wheat, and maize increased rapidly by 200%, 258%, and 741%, respectively, whereas for soybean, potato, and other cereals, the increases in the GWF were relatively small. GWF intensities of rice, wheat, and maize were higher than those of other crops, ranging from 1.71 × 104 to 5.5 × 104 m3/hm2. Chemical fertilizers were the main source of GWF from 1990 to 2018. Moreover, the degradation risk caused by the GWF significantly increased.

However, bringing synergistic gains for multiple stakeholders is still a challenge for regional sustainable management. We took the Changhuajiang basin in China's Hainan Island as a case to present the impacts of synergistic management for upstream forest and reservoir optimization on the benefits of downstream hydropower enterprise and different farmers. By multimodel ensembles and scenario analysis, we quantified the relationships among upstream forest ecosystem management (rubber-intercropped), reservoir, water flow and downstream stakeholders' benefits (i.e., hydropower generation for the energy company, and available irrigation water for two downstream sites' farmers). We also adopted the genetic optimization algorithm to obtain the optimal reservoir infrastructure operation rule for the benefit improvement of multiple stakeholders. We found that rubber-intercropped management significantly increased reservoir inflow in the dry seasons (5%–170%) and reduced it in the rainy seasons (0.5%–7%). The irrigation water availability for downstream farmers in the Gao Canal and downstream irrigation areas correspondingly increased by 7% and 24.3% on average, respectively, with a slight change in hydropower production. Further, we found that water regulation by reservoir optimization operation could enhance the irrigation water supply (36.6–92% and 0–100% in Gao Canal and downstream irrigation areas, respectively) and hydropower generation (14.8–28.4%). This study indicates that the effect of upstream forest management on downstream multistakeholders' benefits could be strengthened by reservoir water flow regulation across the forest-water-energy-food nexus, and demonstrates the key role of infrastructure in regulating ecosystem service flow for strengthening the benefits of multistakeholders in the context of ecosystem management.

To coordinate the principal contradictory tasks of peak shaving, ship navigation, and power generation in day-ahead scheduling, a mixed integer linear programming model for the short-term multi-objective optimal scheduling is constructed. Specifically, a novel power release-based indicator is adopted to describe the navigation objective, while the minimization of the peak-valley difference of the residual load and the total water released are taken as the other two objective functions. Constraint aggregation and rectangular meshing methods are employed to handle the challenging nonlinear and nonconvex constraints. Subsequently, the Normalized Normal Constraint method, integrated with the mathematical optimization solver Gurobi, generates a set of well-distributed Pareto solutions, each representing a scheduling scheme. Finally, the Combined Weighting - Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution is utilized as a decision-maker to trade off and determine a compromise solution for final implementation. Case studies on the cascade hydropower reservoirs of the Wujiang River in China demonstrate that the proposed model can adequately characterize the demands of various stakeholders, and the suggested framework can obtain an even and extensive Pareto front, mediate conflicts, and make reasonable decisions. Compared to the original peak-shaving scheme, the finalized compromise scheme reduces the peak-shaving effect by just 27.82% but offers simultaneous boosts of 96.54% in navigation benefits and 10.88% in power generation benefits. Consequently, the presented framework can be a promising alternative for conflict resolution of cascade hydropower reservoirs.

Understanding the spatial heterogeneous driving forces of urban waterlogging ";" Urban waterlogging seriously threatens urban sustainable development and human life. The effects of various landscape elements on urban waterlogging have been extensively documented. However, less attention is deserved to the spatial heterogeneity effects of urban landscape elements on urban waterlogging. The spatial pattern of dominant driving forces and how the interactive effects of landscape elements affect urban waterlogging with different environmental configurations have not been well examined. These shortcomings have hindered the development of target-specific urban waterlogging mitigation strategies. To shed some light on this topic, an innovative method that integrated the boruta algorithm, cubist regression tree, and geographical detector model is presented to investigate the spatial heterogeneous mechanisms of urban waterlogging and map the waterlogging dominant driving forces with different local conditions. The results show that the boruta algorithm proposed in this study introduces shadow variables as a benchmark, thus enabling an unbiased and stable selection of representative waterlogging driving factors based on local conditions. By comparing with two other commonly used regression methods (global regression model, spatial lag model), the cubist regression tree divides the urban waterlogging space into multiple homogeneous subgroups to quantify the spatial non-stationarity relationship and spatially explicit the local driving forces in Guangzhou and Shenzhen, with the adjusted R 2 of 0.79 and 0.88. The geographical detector model denotes that waterlogging magnitude within different subgroups is affected by different dominant factors. Even for the same dominant factor, its contribution to waterlogging varies considerably in different subgroups. The independent contribution of the dominant factor in Guangzhou was 23.28%–57.82%, while in Shenzhen it ranged from 25.95% to 53.59%. In addition to the dominant factor of each subgroup, it is noteworthy that in some subgroups the combined effect of different representative factors on waterlogging is significantly stronger than the contribution of their dominant factors. In view of this, urban planners and local authorities need to comprehensively consider the interaction effect between representative factors, which develop urban waterlogging mitigation strategies that integrate multiple factors. The results from this study extend our scientific understanding of the site-specific mechanism of urban waterlogging, which facilitates the implementation of more targeted and effective mitigation strategies, rather than a “one-size-fits-all” policy.

However, the environmental impacts of aquaculture can vary greatly, and it is essential to understand the relationship between the nutrition provided by aquatic species and their multiple environmental footprints for targeted dietary advice and sustainable development of aquaculture. In this study, we examined 49 aquatic species or taxa divided into eight groups, considering ten nutrients and five environmental impacts for Chinese aquaculture. The results showed that species varied widely in their nutritional values and environmental impacts, with mussel, razor clam, marine bass, flounder and snapper being the most recommended for sustainable performance (sustainability score S i > 1.60). In contrast, tilapia performed poorly (S i = 0.11) in both nutritional score and environmental impacts, thus should not be promoted in dietary advice. Results of spatial analysis showed that Qinghai (S i = 1.06) and Tibet (S i = 0.75) had the highest sustainable development level for freshwater aquaculture, while there were large differences in marine aquaculture among coastal provinces (the highest S i in Zhejiang was 1.42, and the lowest S i in Guangxi was 0.56) and the sustainable performance of all coastal provinces is reduced to varying degrees when freshwater aquaculture and marine aquaculture are considered comprehensively. Increasing the proportion of high sustainable performance species is an effective way to improve the sustainability score in most provinces, particularly coastal ones. We suggest that the proportion of species production should be adjusted, and the cultivation of species with high sustainable performance should be prioritized.

The FEWN can be interpreted as the study of the connections between the food, energy and water resource systems, emphasizing how decision-making influences the synergies, conflicts and trade-offs among the various sectors. In recent years, modeling and optimization of FEWN systems has been receiving an increasing interest in the open literature, however, with limited emphasis on how decisions of the FEWN are derived. In this review, FEWN optimization studies are analyzed with focus on the employed objectives, optimization and solution strategies, as well as the selected sub-systems and their corresponding spatial and temporal scales to uncover in detail how decision-making is facilitated. More specifically, FEWN optimization studies are classified according to their modeling and solution strategies. Based on this classification it is uncovered that (i) the decision-making itself has not yet been investigated in detail in FEWN literature, (ii) the incorporation of all aspects of the FEWN is still a challenge, (iii) the interconnection between FEWN systems and society has to be further investigated, and (iv) the implications of uncertainty for the resiliency, robustness and security of process systems is not yet well defined. Additionally, a generic FEWN resource-task network formulation is introduced to illustrate the similarities across the various resource supply sectors. Special interest is placed on how synergies are identified and competition be avoided among resource systems. It is shown that the selected spatial scale as well as the utilized modeling and optimization strategies significantly influence the synergy level of obtained solutions.

Although hydrological performance of LIDs in relation to climates is readily available, there is still a gap on the evaluation of environmental and economic impacts of these infrastructures. We have evaluated the cradle-to- site lifecycle environmental and economic impacts of four LIDs using a case study of the stormwater management system at UBC Okanagan campus in BC, Canada. The environmental impacts and costs are determined via ReCiPe, TRACI, and net present value (NPV) method, respectively, and incorporated to obtain eco-efficiency of these LIDs. We found that the box planter and naturally occurring wetland on campus are the best LIDs with lower impacts (approximately 2.5% of the total impacts) than other LIDs. The cost savings from wetland are enormous due to zero construction and periodic maintenance after every five years. The box planter and wetland occupy the most favorable quadrant III of the eco-efficiency matrix whilst, bioswales and rain gardens are found in quadrant IV and I, respectively. When compared to the constructed wetland, an increase in the economic impacts is found without any influence on the eco-efficiency of the overall placement on eco-efficiency matrix. The maintenance phase contributes more to environmental impacts than the construction, whereas the life cycle cost analysis shows the opposite.

However, due to the inherent spatiotemporal variability of N exports under different land uses and hydrological regimes, it is essential to quantitatively evaluate the impact of landscape pattern on total N export coefficients (TNECs) and identify the threshold effect of TNECs between key landscape metrics. Based on river monitoring data for eight years in nine catchments of a typical agricultural watershed in the central subtropical region of China, we estimated the spatiotemporal variability and uncertainty of typical land-use TNECs (cropland, forest, and tea gardens) by combining an improved pollutant export coefficient model and Bayesian statistics. Subsequently, the contribution of landscape pattern to the variability in land use TNECs under different hydrological regimes was quantified, and the abrupt change points of TNECs along with the gradient of key landscape metrics were further determined. The results revealed that landscape pattern only had a significant effect on TNECs under medium-flow (representing discharge values within the 30–70th percentile range) and low-flow hydrological regimes (70–100th percentile range), explaining 48.1–54.7% and 55.2–69.3% of the variability, respectively. Threshold effects were observed between key landscape metrics representing different landscape categories (area edge, shape, and aggregation) and TNECs for each land use, and the threshold intervals corresponding to the TNEC abrupt change points were relatively consistent under medium- and low-flow regimes. These results serve as a critical reference for land-use planning and management to improve water quality, the approaches developed can be broadly extended to other regions with diverse land-use types and pollutant sources.

It has long been considered one of the most important biological indicators for monitoring water pollution. However, our understanding of the various aspects of phytoplankton communities assembly and the factors driving them remains limited. In this study, we conducted collection and analysis of phytoplankton samples from a temperate wetland cluster encompassing both lake and marsh types under the backdrop of industrial pollution from the petroleum industry. Our aim was to investigate the influence of spatial factors, land use patterns, and local environmental variables on the taxonomic and functional structure of the phytoplankton community, utilizing structural equation modeling (SEM) and variation partitioning. Our results revealed that environmental filtering exerts a greater relative impact on shaping the taxonomic composition of phytoplankton compared to mass effects. Human activities, such as industrial and agricultural production, can lead to landscape modifications that increase water nutrient levels and consequently influence the community composition. Taxonomic beta diversity is determined by both mass effects and environmental filtering. In contrast, functional beta diversity responds more to local environmental gradients, while the land use pattern was not important for facets of beta diversity in the wetland cluster. These results validate the concordance and complementarity between functional and taxonomy-based biome structures, highlighting the significance of integrating multiple ecological drivers. The results of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of wetland community assembly and the processes of biogeography, and are of crucial significance for the biological monitoring and management of freshwater ecosystem environmental pollution.

However, the evolution and obstacles of coupled development are largely ignored. This study developed a framework dividing links in the nexus to select indicators and integrated models for the degree of coordination and obstacle diagnosis to explore the coupled development of the WEF nexus from 2000 to 2020 in the water-scarce megacities of Beijing and Tianjin. The results show that the average coordination degree of the WEF nexus in Beijing (0.315) and Tianjin (0.317) is at a low level, indicating a limited interaction between the WEF subsystems, while the coordinated development degree of the WEF nexus is increasing. The order degree of the WEF subsystems shows a two-level hierarchical structure, indicating that both similarities and differences are included in place-specific characteristics. Furthermore, obstacle factors are identified from water and energy subsystems, in which environmental water use (W3) and the energy consumption per gross domestic production unit (E4) played the most significant roles and require a higher priority in policy response. The results in this paper complement obstacle factor analysis in WEF nexus practice, and provide operational indicators for nexus governance.

In this study, the airflow migration mechanism and benzene removal in a heterogeneous aquifer during air sparging (AS) and SEAS remediation were studied using a light transmission visualisation technology. The blocking effect of the heterogeneous geological interface on airflow clearly decreased owing to the surfactant injection. At a surfactant concentration of 800 mg/L, the ΔPe value (i.e., the air entry pressure difference of the media above and below the interface) decreased from 0.3 kPa to 0.1 kPa. After surfactant injection, there was obvious downward migration owing to gravity. Compared with AS, the lateral migration of airflow at the interface and the fingered distribution of air flowrate above the interface improved considerably during SEAS, which increased the total benzene removal rates from 0.624 to 0.979. Moreover, the spatial distribution of the surfactant changed due to prolonged AS, which decreased the zone of influence area and airflow distribution range. However, the surfactant redistribution further enhanced the rectangular distribution of air flowrate, which was beneficial for continuous benzene removal in the low-permeability zone above the interface. These findings are useful for further understanding remediation mechanisms and optimising the technological parameters of SEAS technology in layered heterogeneous aquifer.

The present study investigated the relationship between liquor production wastewater and water quality in the Chishui River Basin for the first time and proposes several constructive suggestions. After river remediation, water quality in spring, summer, autumn, and winter in the Chishui River Basin was found to be at an excellent level, with water quality in winter being the best. Worse water quality and higher health risks were found in liquor production areas (Guling County and Renhuai City) in comparison with other areas. The developed structural equation model showed that physicochemical indexes (especially in N and P) have a higher influence on water quality in comparison with the algae community, heavy metals, and environmental factors. Because liquor being a pillar industry in the locality and these factories discharging an enormous amount of wastewater every year, our results show that liquor production wastewater have affected the water quality to some extent in the Guling County and Renhuai City sections of the Chishui River Basin, and fortunately, the health risks were acceptable in 2020. To prevent potential risks, we suggest that a related department should apply a stricter standard to wastewater discharge. Furthermore, law-enforcement departments can encourage enterprises to develop or introduce more advanced water treatment technologies to achieve as much pollution-free discharge as possible.

In this study, an integrated optimization decision system (IODS) was developed for supporting precise management of non-point source nitrogen pollution under multiple uncertainties. Several kinds of methods were innovatively coupled into the IODS, including material flow analysis (MFA), Gumbel copula model (GCM), path analysis (PA), and interval multi-objective chance constraint programming (IMOCCP). The IODS could (i) identify the main sources of non-point source pollution through the MFA; (ii) estimate the pollution status of different zones within the entire watershed using the GCM and PA; (iii) incorporate the pollution sources and pollution status to the IMOCCP as decision variables and development scenarios (i.e., S1 to S3), respectively. The settlement of the IMOCCP model could provide targeted optimal solutions to zones of different pollution status, with minimized non-point source nitrogen pollution and maximized economic benefit. Our research demonstrates great advantage of precise management in obtaining more environmental profits and economic benefits. Specifically, the precise management makes the system benefit increased by about [89.86%, 96.10%], [87.35%, 95.00%], and [28.23%, 60.40%] from S1 to S3, respectively.

Only the network in the waterlogged area is reformed, which is lack of systematicness, and may lead to the failure of waterlogging control. To solve this problem, the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM 5.1) is used to analyze the rationality of the current pipe network reconstruction methods using three indicators: the maximum overflow depth, the maximum overflow volume, and the conduit surcharge. And a new reconstruction method for drainage pipe networks is developed by R programming. The results show that the current pipe network reconstruction method is still insufficient to achieve the goal of eliminating node overflow. For different rainfall conditions, there are still existing low-risk areas, with maximum overflow depth can reach up to 0.15 m and maximum overflow volume can reach up to 7.12 m3.

The occurrence of different stress factors in nature is often simultaneous and the effect of multiple stress factors on living organisms cannot be investigated separately. Although it is essential to evaluate plant and microbial community responses to the combination of different abiotic stresses simultaneously, many scientists have used a single evaluative approach to study the effect of cadmium and/or water stress on the response of plant and/or soil microorganisms. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of water stress and cadmium together on the development and growth of Medicago scutellata L. and soil biological activity. To investigate potential relationships among inter-correlated variables and comprehend potential mechanisms, predictive regression modeling, principal component analysis, and path analysis were implemented. Considering the outcomes, cadmium at low concentrations stimulates nodule growth and the fungi population. Moderate water stress (50%) decreased the bacteria population while it did not affect the fungi population. The obtained results of this study suggest that soil microsymbiont such as fungi might have a significant role in maintaining (as well as increasing) the nitrogen fixation ability of Medicago under low cadmium stress. Except for the removal rate (0.683), all predictive equation models showed strong linear fitness of the regression models, with adjusted R 2 values ranging from 0.838 to 0.987.

This study investigates the impact of the dam on the hydrological abundance and eco-hydrological alterations of Loktak Lake, which is located upstream of the Ithai barrage. For this purpose, the Indicator of Hydrological Alteration (IHA) was used to examine the ecohydrological threshold, failure rate, impact magnitude and ecohydrological deficit/surplus in a river section and the adjacent wetland in three temporal phases (I, 1996–2001; II, 2006–2011; and III, 2016–2021). The results show that the hydrological surplus has recently increased to 27.22% (phase III), while in phase I it was only 1.1%. Due to the decreasing failure rate of ecological optima, eco-hydrological surplus was recorded in both Loktak lakes, which is an obvious indication of a reduction in ecological distress that may lead to negative impacts on natural and human well-being. However, due to the constant high-water level in the lake, Phumdi is no longer able to reach the bottom of the lake during the dry season. Since it cannot absorb nutrients, the lake's vegetation declines and rotting sediments settle.

In order to explain the linkages 16 tie channels’ change depicting variables and seven wetland area and hydrological transformation (consistency, hydro-period, water depth, water richness etc.) related variables were taken. Ordinary least square (OLS) regression was applied for explain the linkage. Machine learning approaches were applied for water richness mapping. Tie channel evolution was digitized from the Survey of India (SOI) toposheet (1974) and historical Google Earth images. The result revealed that, the tie channel witnessed morphological and hydrological degradations like channel constriction, channel clogging, flow lowering etc. and these were further identified as some vectors of areal shrinkage and growing hydrological insecurity in the linked wetlands. The total wetland area declined from 44.89 km2 to 16.86 km2 from 1991 to 2021.

The simulation model employs an effective template for planning and decision-making in the nexus system. The CESNeX simulates the energy subsystem in both the demand and supply sides as required in the nexus simulation of EWF on a river basin scale, considering nexus variables. The CESNeX evaluates the effects of various energy generation scenarios on the water subsystem by interacting with the principal nexus variables on the supply side of the energy subsystem. In the comprehensive simulation of the nexus system, the CESNeX can interact with water and food subsystems via nexus variables and provide the energy-efficient cropping pattern. The demand side of CESNeX can assist policymakers in developing an appropriate cropping pattern, considering water and energy consumption. Additionally, the supply side of CESNeX can provide the produced energy based on water consumption and the change in the reservoir head. 14 years of data (2008–2021) from the Great Karun Basin's Karun-4, Karun-3, Karun-1, Masjed Soleyman, Gotvand, and Dez reservoirs are utilized for the simulation's calibration, verification, and modelling. On the supply side, results revealed that by increasing the nexus variable of Karun-4's firm energy by about 5%, the reservoir net head is related to the Karun-3 power plant decreased by 1.93 m.

Herein, this study compared the pollutant removal load and removal performance of four fillers over 120-d to screen for the best fillers (CB: nitrate (36.85 mg/g), V(V) (2.07 mg/g)). UV–vis and fluorescence spectra were used to analyze the distribution of dissolved organic matters (DOM) in effluent and to assess the possible environmental risk. The distribution of microbial community structure revealed that the type of carbon source was one of the important factors to shape the community structure. Based on metagenomic techniques, the advantage of co-pollution removal in the CB system were energy storage and preferential electron utilization of NH4 +-N and organic nitrogen production. Moreover, the detoxification of vanadium in CB was mainly mediated by receiving electrons from the electron transfer chain, while vanadium in GL was mainly mediated by NarG and NapA.

The traditional linear water management model is one of the causes of global water shortage, following a take-make-use-dispose pattern that is both environmentally and economically unsustainable. The circular economy has been proposed to mitigate water shortages, encouraging a paradigm shift in urban water systems. A circular water system seeks to close the water loop by reducing consumption, recovering natural resources, and minimizing waste. Compared with a centralized water system, a distributed water system is more flexible and resilient as it allows neighborhoods to prepare for unexpected stressor events. However, there have been no thorough investigations of essential factors that primarily impact the decision-making process of implementing distributed water systems. Thus, this study aims to uncover significant selection criteria that impact the assessment of feasible options to assist in the planning phase.

We hypothesize that residual feed organic matter (RFOM) can contribute to increased dissolved reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations in the water column by altering sediment phosphorus release characteristics (PRCS), including phosphorus fractions (i.e., Fe–P) and phosphorus adsorption (i.e., Qmax, EPC0), which is ultimately conducive to the formation of cyanobacteria blooms. Three types of aquaculture waters that were never feeding (NF), long-term feeding (LF), and stopped feeding (SF) for several years were studied to verify the above hypothesis. The results showed that the concentrations of SRP and chlorophyll-a in LF were significantly higher than those in SF and NF (P < 0.05). RFOM significantly affects PRCS with a power function relationship with EPC0 and a linear relationship with Qmax. Similarly, SRP in the water column was positively correlated with PRCS (i.e., Fe–P, EPC0), cyanobacterial biomass, and trophic state index (P < 0.01). This suggested that SRP may be an essential link between sediment and algal community structure. Simulation experiments further confirmed the above hypothesis, With the increase in RFOM (94.36 g/kg), PRCS (i.e., Fe–P, EPC0, and Qmax) increased significantly, which were 6.60, 282.36, and 2.47 times that of the control group, respectively.

This paper uses super efficient Slacks-Based Measure (SBM) to measure agricultural total factor productivity (ATFP) in the regions along the Yellow River, and uses difference-in-difference (DID) model to explore the impact of NWSC on ATFP based on the theory of production factor flow. The results show that: First, the ATFP in the regions along the Yellow River demonstrated an initial increase followed by a decrease from 2000 to 2019, the ATFP in the regions along the Yellow River is low in the north and high in the south, and the ATFP of the main grain producing areas is generally higher. Second, the establishment of the NWSC can effectively improve the ATFP, the ATFP has increased by 6.57% compared with the control group, and the dynamic effect of the policy has shown an “N"" pattern since its implementation. Particularly, in areas with relatively poor water resources, high agricultural factor intensification and major grain production areas, NWSC has a stronger impact on the ATFP. Third, NWSC has promoted the flow of labor production factors and improved ATFP through income effect, industrial synergy effect and technological innovation effect. The transfer of agricultural labor has also injected strong impetus into industrial development, and improved the return on industrial capital, which can promote agricultural capital more significantly, and further improved ATFP. Our findings provide empirical evidence for achieving high-quality agricultural development through the construction of NWSC.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138068";"Promoting effect and mechanism of residual feed organic matter on the formation of cyanobacterial blooms in aquaculture waters ";" Cyanobacterial blooms and eutrophication often occur in aquaculture waters where feeds are used. We hypothesize that residual feed organic matter (RFOM) can contribute to increased dissolved reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations in the water column by altering sediment phosphorus release characteristics (PRCS), including phosphorus fractions (i.e., Fe–P) and phosphorus adsorption (i.e., Qmax, EPC0), which is ultimately conducive to the formation of cyanobacteria blooms. Three types of aquaculture waters that were never feeding (NF), long-term feeding (LF), and stopped feeding (SF) for several years were studied to verify the above hypothesis. The results showed that the concentrations of SRP and chlorophyll-a in LF were significantly higher than those in SF and NF (P < 0.05). RFOM significantly affects PRCS with a power function relationship with EPC0 and a linear relationship with Qmax. Similarly, SRP in the water column was positively correlated with PRCS (i.e., Fe–P, EPC0), cyanobacterial biomass, and trophic state index (P < 0.01). This suggested that SRP may be an essential link between sediment and algal community structure. Simulation experiments further confirmed the above hypothesis, With the increase in RFOM (94.36 g/kg), PRCS (i.e., Fe–P, EPC0, and Qmax) increased significantly, which were 6.60, 282.36, and 2.47 times that of the control group, respectively. The sediment bacterial community and the partial least squares path model indicated that RFOM could regulate the SRP concentration in the water body and promote the formation of cyanobacterial blooms through PRCS, in which Firmicutes played an important role.

The case of a fragile coastal area, Arcachon Bay (SW, France)";"The potentially negative environmental effects of pesticides and antibiotics are a source of concern for public health. Many studies in recent years have focused on so-called “emerging micropollutants” emanating from domestic activity and found primarily in cleaning products, cosmetics, and medicines. This awareness of potential risks to the natural environment has evolved considerably since the 1970s. Sustained population growth in urban areas has forced public policy makers to pay more attention to the links between health and the environment, and specifically to the complexity of medicine consumption. Using a practice theory approach, this article aims to identify how sustainable daily medicine consumption practices are. Our research is based on the analysis of medicine consumption in relation to four interdependent elements: prescription, treatment, unused medication, and representations of environmental issues. First, the background of practice theory and sustainable medicine consumption are discussed. This approach is then applied to quantitative data from a questionnaire survey on consumers that we conducted in a French coastal area subject to specific demographic pressure and micropollution of the water. A multivariate statistical exploratory analysis of the data set highlights the structure of the practices concerned, and the extent to which environmental issues are considered when unused medication is disposed of. We conclude by highlighting the relevance of our approach in understanding the complex nature of sustainable medicine consumption, which involves diverse communities of practice. We also underline the need for public policy to target all stakeholders in the medicine consumption process, from medical professionals to end users.";"2023-09-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623020243";"1";"Water Other"

However, although urban runoff drainage systems are configured mainly based on rainfall analysis, climate change influences their hydrological properties substantially. This research introduces an innovative methodology to analyze climate variations on optimal low impact developments (LIDs) of urban drainage systems in historical periods based on annual impacts (AIs) in projection periods considering uncertainties assessments. First, Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) is employed for simulating the process of rainfall-runoff considering quality and quantity analyses. This simulation model is coupled with a non-dominated genetic algorithm- II (NSGA-II) optimization algorithm to minimize the cost of LIDs, flood volume, and pollutant load. Then, future runoff and daily rainfall are projected on a yearly basis, including maximum, minimum, and median rainfall, to identify how climate change affects catchment properties. These projections and an ensemble model are obtained based on the Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG), which considers uncertainties. After that, the projected daily precipitation is fragmented into hourly segments utilizing the change factor approach (CFA). Finally, the ideal optimum type, size, and placement of the chosen LIDs are determined using the presented simulation-optimization (SO) model. To prove the effectiveness and appropriateness of the presented framework, it is implemented in a real-world study area in Darabad catchment, Tehran, Iran. Results indicate that the developed optimal LIDs are well-designed and sufficient in both the historical and projection periods. The findings also depict that with the current LIDs established for the historical period, the flooding volume and summation of total suspended solid (TSS) and total Nitrogen (TN) removals are decreased by 55.96% and 60.2% compared to when LIDs are not adopted. In addition, employing the developed LIDs based on an ensemble model results in the runoff volume and pollutants removal decline of up to 31.39% and 46.9%, respectively.

However, the underlying influencing mechanisms, especially the impact of operations on sediment processes, remain unclear. This study combines a coupled hydrodynamic-eutrophication-sediment model and a reservoir operation model to clarify reservoir operation impact on N cycling processes in water and sediment as well as impact on stored and discharged water quality. Three typical reservoir operation policies (i.e., standard, hedging, and eco-friendly) were selected to create operation scenarios. The hydrodynamic-eutrophication-sediment model was used to simulate N cycling processes and N concentrations in stored and discharged water under each scenario. Using China's Danjiangkou Reservoir as a case study, results revealed that reservoir operation policies significantly affected spatiotemporal dynamics of N cycling processes and water quality. Specifically, reservoir sediment acted as a N source, contributing to annual net release of 9.5–16.1 Gg N. Higher water levels promoted sediment ammonium release through effects on reservoir submerged area and sediment temperature. Moreover, denitrification processes in water and sediment collectively contributed to annual N removal of 14.0–16.9 Gg N. Annual N removal was greater in the higher water level scenario despite its lower denitrification rate per unit area. Additionally, these processes and hydrodynamic conditions combine to affect N forms and concentrations. The N concentration in the lower water level scenario was generally higher, risking algal bloom outbreaks in the shallow-water zone. This study is intended to help guide reservoir operation policymaking to account for N management while also coordinating water quantity and quality targets.

A comparison of water footprint assessment methods ";" Food consumption is responsible for most global water consumption and associated environmental consequences. Therefore, quantifying and monitoring the water footprint (WF) of food consumption patterns is relevant to support policymaking toward sustainable diets. Although multiple WF approaches are available, such as Water Footprint Assessment (WFA) and the model AWARE (Available Water Remaining) for supply chains analysis, the latest is considered the reference after following an international consultation process. This research aims to develop a comparative methodological approach between the volumetric blue water footprint assessment (WFA), a pressure method, and the scarcity-weighted WF AWARE model as an impact method to evaluate the WF of EU27 food consumption. Due to limited blue WFA data availability, two scopes were considered: an “aligned scope” (cradle to farm gate) comparing both methods and a “full supply chain scope” (cradle to grave) only possible with AWARE. In the aligned scope, almonds and cashew have the largest pressure and impact in both methods (per kg of product). EU food consumption has a WF pressure under an “aligned scope” of ≈54 m3/capita/year and an impact of ≈3525 m3 eq/capita/year. When considering the ""full supply chain"", WF impact due to EU food consumption increases by 30% (compared with the ""aligned scope""), with wine and chocolate at the top of the ranking. Integration of WFA data within the LCA inventory could be explored when WFA data also covers indirect WF of background processes and other supply chain stages.

Applying shading cloths over water reservoirs reduces solar radiation and wind acting on the water surface, possibly affecting the evaporation losses and water quality therein. The complex thermal fluid dynamics, including biochemical reactions, make it difficult to answer the question of which color and intensity shading cloth best controls water reservoirs’ performance in a specific climate. This study aims to establish a systematic approach to determine the best portfolio of shading cloths in the framework of robust optimization with demonstrations in the arid and semi-arid climates of Jordan. Firstly, intensive experiments were conducted at a site in a steppe climate, using thirty class-A evaporation pans covered by ten different shading treatments, including the control. Secondly, a physical model was developed to represent the dynamics in each pan. The experimental results were utilized for the calibration-validation procedure for the physical model. Then, robust optimization problems are formulated with uncertainty sets, where numerical solutions of the physical model determine nominal values of evaporation rates. However, the experimental results exclusively do the uncertainty intervals of evaporation rates and the whole uncertainty sets of chlorophyll-a.

Quickly obtaining VOC distribution and tracing emission sources are of great significance to ensure the security of water quality. In this study, we developed a mobile shipborne spray inlet proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (S-SI-PTR-MS) instrument for rapid and on-line detection of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in surface water. It mainly consists of a shipborne platform, a spray inlet system, a proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer, and geographic information software (GIS). During the navigation, VOCs in water can be quickly extracted to gaseous state by the SI system and transferred into the proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) for detection. The GIS can receive VOC and longitude-latitude data at the same time. And then the identification and concentration information can be shown on an electronic map in real time. The limit of detection and response time were 1.32 μg/L∼9.43 μg/L and 56 s∼114 s, respectively. The spatial resolution is 0.14 m in a common navigation experiment (5 km/h, dwell time=0.1 s), allowing for high-resolution monitoring of VOCs in water.

Identifying BOWs in urban areas is difficult because they are usually small in area, and discontinuous in spatial distribution. The efforts to adapt to climate change in cities have a direct connection to urban environment and may affect the dynamics of BOWs, but their relationship has seldom been addressed in previous research. This research builds a new urban BOW detection model using Gaofen (GF) images and ground-level in-situ water quality data to detect the spatiotemporal dynamics of BOWs in Guangzhou City's main urban area from 2016 to 2020, when comprehensive climate adaptation strategy has been implemented as a pilot metropolitan area in China. Spatial analysis in the study area with a total of 97 focused rivers revealed a decreasing trend in BOW occurrence (from 85.57% in 2016 to 21.65% in 2020) in the context of climate change adaptation efforts. Redundancy analysis between BOWs occurrence and environmental factors showed that across the entire study area, the contributions of anthropogenic factors (highest proportion at 14.3% for the area percentage of built-ups) to BOW, such as population density, agricultural water use, domestic water use, and so on, distinctly stronger than climatic drivers (largest contribution of 4.4% for temperature). The results suggested that climate change adaptation efforts help to decrease BOW occurrence in the study area, while exploring the response mechanism between climate change adaptation measures and the changes of BOWs is necessary in the future research.

To address this current issue, a new kind of adsorbent named isostructural zeolitic tetrazolate imidazolate frameworks (ZTIFs) were synthesized by combining imidazole and tetrazolates into one self-assembly approach by adjusting pores and stability of frameworks. The incorporation of imidazole ligand progressively increased the stability of frameworks. Furthermore, increasing the content of tetrazolate ligand greatly improved the adsorption performance due to N-rich sites by increasing the pore size. The obtained adsorbent composite exhibits macroporous structure up to 53.05 nm with excellent structural stability. Owing to their macropores and highly exposed active sites, the synthesized ZTIFs exhibit the maximum adsorption capacity for oseltamivir (OT) and ritonavir (RT) of 585.2 mg/g and 435.8 mg/g, respectively. Moreover, the adsorption uptake and saturation process were rapid compared to simple MOF. Within 20 min, both pollutants achieved equilibrium.

In this study, 102 surface water samples were collected and numerical simulations were conducted by coupling SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and MIKE 21 models to investigate the effect of hydrodynamic conditions on the transport and distribution of Pb in Jiaozhou Bay, China. The tidal current velocity was lowest at flood tide and highest at ebb tide in summer, mainly due to the strong runoff caused by heavy rainfall in summer. The velocity of the residual current near the bay mouth was high, with an average value of 0.32 m/s. The residual currents had alternating clockwise and counter-clockwise circulations of different diameters in the bay mouth and the northern bay. The circulation diameter in the bay mouth area was large, and the circulation extended from the bay mouth to the Yellow Sea. Due to the small circulation diameters and opposite directions of the adjacent circulations in the northern bay, pollutants were easily trapped there. The dissolved Pb particles released from the northern bay mainly migrated to the shore, while the dissolved Pb particles released from the bay mouth tended to migrate to the Yellow Sea. The dominant wind directions and residual currents were the main driving forces affecting the trajectories of the particle tracking simulations. The dissolved Pb concentration in the water was high near shore and in the southwestern bay and under the combined effects of tidal residual current, wind force, and river and wastewater inputs.

To address this current issue, a new kind of adsorbent named isostructural zeolitic tetrazolate imidazolate frameworks (ZTIFs) were synthesized by combining imidazole and tetrazolates into one self-assembly approach by adjusting pores and stability of frameworks. The incorporation of imidazole ligand progressively increased the stability of frameworks. Furthermore, increasing the content of tetrazolate ligand greatly improved the adsorption performance due to N-rich sites by increasing the pore size. The obtained adsorbent composite exhibits macroporous structure up to 53.05 nm with excellent structural stability. Owing to their macropores and highly exposed active sites, the synthesized ZTIFs exhibit the maximum adsorption capacity for oseltamivir (OT) and ritonavir (RT) of 585.2 mg/g and 435.8 mg/g, respectively. Moreover, the adsorption uptake and saturation process were rapid compared to simple MOF. Within 20 min, both pollutants achieved equilibrium. The adsorption isotherms were best interpreted by Pseudo second order kinetics. The adsorption of AVDs on ZTIFs was spontaneous, exothermic, and thermodynamically feasible. The DFT calculations and characterization results after adsorption demonstrate that π-π interaction, pore filling, surface complexation, and electrostatic interaction were the primary features of the adsorption mechanism. The prepared ZTIFs composite exhibits high chemical, mechanical and thermal stability and can be recycled multiple times without destroying its morphology and structure. The adsorbent regeneration for several cycles impacted the operational cost and the eco-friendly characteristic of the process.

Rapid population growth, urban expansion, and industrialization have caused the degradation of wetlands over the last few decades. The wetlands located in the urban and peri-urban areas are generally the most threatened ecosystems globally. The present study assessed the ecosystem health of urban and peri-urban wetlands of Lucknow district in India and recommended a sustainable solution for their management. Remote sensing data derived from the normalized difference vegetation index, modified normalized difference water index, and land use/land cover change were utilized for analyzing the spatiotemporal change in areas under wetlands, from 1989 to 2018. Site-specific indicators on pressure, state and response were integrated in FRAGSTATS-based assessment to construct a Pressure-State-Response (PSR) model. A qualitative field survey has been conducted through focus group discussion and expert opinion to validate the result from the PSR model. The results revealed that the overall health of the wetlands has deteriorated drastically in these peri-urban areas owing to anthropogenic activities. The wetland ecosystem's health is significantly correlated with land transformation. The study recommended community participation, and involvement of local authorities in storing rainwater, constructing culverts and channels, and interlinking them with wetlands for sustainable conservation and effective management of the wetland ecosystem.";"2023-08-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623018048";"18";"Water Other"

In this study, 102 surface water samples were collected and numerical simulations were conducted by coupling SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) and MIKE 21 models to investigate the effect of hydrodynamic conditions on the transport and distribution of Pb in Jiaozhou Bay, China. The tidal current velocity was lowest at flood tide and highest at ebb tide in summer, mainly due to the strong runoff caused by heavy rainfall in summer. The velocity of the residual current near the bay mouth was high, with an average value of 0.32 m/s. The residual currents had alternating clockwise and counter-clockwise circulations of different diameters in the bay mouth and the northern bay. The circulation diameter in the bay mouth area was large, and the circulation extended from the bay mouth to the Yellow Sea. Due to the small circulation diameters and opposite directions of the adjacent circulations in the northern bay, pollutants were easily trapped there. The dissolved Pb particles released from the northern bay mainly migrated to the shore, while the dissolved Pb particles released from the bay mouth tended to migrate to the Yellow Sea. The dominant wind directions and residual currents were the main driving forces affecting the trajectories of the particle tracking simulations. The dissolved Pb concentration in the water was high near shore and in the southwestern bay and under the combined effects of tidal residual current, wind force, and river and wastewater inputs. The low Pb concentration near the bay mouth was mainly influenced by the high residual current velocity.

However, the current restricted agricultural water and land resources limit the agricultural production system, and the pressure on global food security is enormous. The development of precise and intelligent irrigation technology is crucial for maintaining the necessary agricultural growth rates without further damage to the environment. The rapid development of machine learning (ML) algorithms provides opportunities for improvements in irrigation efficiency, and ML is thus expected to become an important solution for the modernization of irrigation systems. This review collates all the research on ML in irrigation and presents the types of ML algorithms used in irrigation, the sources of data, and the evolution of ML. The findings on ML are described in detail in terms of water scarcity diagnosis, water demand prediction, and irrigation decision-making while elaborating on how the literature has evolved and the advantages and disadvantages of ML in the field of irrigation.

However, the detailed quantification of spatial relationships between blue and green infrastructure elements has not been conducted about the thermal environment. To study the synergistic effect of water and vegetation, this paper conducted the field measurement and questionnaire on typical UBGI in Tianjin, China. The spatial characteristics and the current situation of the thermal environment of UBGI were obtained, and the thermal demands of UBGI users were established based on the wet-bulb globe temperature (WBGT) and heat index (HI). The results of the study indicated that the synergistic effect of the water body and vegetation was the most significant at a distance of 6 m from the water body. In the condition of light airflow (wind speed ≤1.5 m/s), the different orientations relative to the water body had no significant difference in the thermal environment. Based on the quantification of spatial relationships, the conversion factors (c T and c RH ) of the synergistic effect at different locations in UBGI were obtained. Furthermore, synergistic effect (SE) models of the thermal environment of UBGI were established according to the conversion factors. Meanwhile, the thermal comfort benchmarks for SE models were quantified (WBGT: 25.76–27.96 °C and HI: 24.98–27.25 °C).

Despite this importance, few studies has hitherto been undertaken on examining the odor nuisance and risk of diseases due to contact with untreated overflow. However, quantitative investigation of odor emission from the sanitary sewage overflows has not been addressed. As such, this study aims to scrupulously investigate the deleterious impact of such phenomenon on public health in terms of the aforesaid matters. To this end, a multi-stage methodological approach was employed. Firstly, field data was collected from the vicinity of a wastewater treatment plant for three years, and then the concentrations of H2S in the aqueous phase and gaseous phase were estimated based on the environmental parameters. Afterward, the Gaussian aerial dispersion model and Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment (QMRA) were employed. In parallel, the impact of the exposure to the malodorous H2S emitted from overflow cases was assessed. Furthermore, the results obtained from impact assessment were validated using the developed questionnaire survey. From the results obtained, the following major conclusions are drawn: (1) levels of H2S(g) near the overflow were high enough to be perceived by individuals, (2) concentrations of NH3(g) in the ambient air were estimated lower than the perception threshold, (3) the sulfide concentration in the overflow was the most influential parameter with positive linear correlation with the concentration of H2S(g), (4) the concentration of odor causes high annoyance, according to the questioning from the residents near the overflow events (5) exponential dose-response indicated 89–95% infection risk and (6) the good correlation between the estimated values of annoyance and the real annoyance level perceived by the residents proved accuracy of the methodology for estimation of H2S concentration and annoyance level. The unique findings obtained from this study guide the environmental decision-makers to take pre-emptive actions, preventing risk of infection and complaints from the residents.";"2023-08-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623016566";"11";"Water Other"

It was proved that the formation of PCNB/HPβCD-IC enhanced the water solubility and thermal stability of PCNB by phase solubility study and thermogravimetric analysis respectively. Specifically, the solubility of PCNB in 10 mM HPβCD solution enhanced about 2.83 times, while the initial thermal decomposition temperature of PCNB in PCNB/HPβCD-IC-NF was also increased from 124 °C to 235 °C.

To confront these challenges, an approach that considers the water-energy-food-environment nexus can address multidimensional trade-offs that complicate the efficient use of resources and the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals. In order to provide insights into solutions to these challenges for a specific case, this study develops a modelling toolkit that integrates biophysical and socioeconomic aspects of nexus components in the context of agro-export and irrigation expansion in Ecuador, a Belt and Road Country. The nexus toolkit is applied to agricultural-development scenarios defined in participatory workshops and incorporates a water resources model, a lifecycle environmental assessment, and a socioeconomic analysis. The modelling exercise is constructed around specific scenario-determined land use patterns in the Santa Elena peninsula of Ecuador. Agriculture in the peninsula is water-limited, relying on delivery infrastructure and transfers from a neighbouring catchment. Impacts on nexus components are analysed for ten crops under two potential land-use scenarios: a substantial increase in irrigated area due to investment in irrigation infrastructure; and a substantial shift in land use towards export crops. The two have distinct impact on water and energy use, global warming potential, freshwater eutrophication, terrestrial acidification, and fine particulate matter formation. The results provide insights into future water and energy resource challenges and environmental and socioeconomic trade-offs associated with likely changes in irrigation expansion. The results for scenarios show that, for example, banana production has the greatest environmental impacts (e.g. a 519% increase in global warming potential and 452% increase in fine particulate matter form for scenario 2), primarily due to water and energy requirements, despite the crop being mainly produced organically. In addition, total net income and labour demand increase (net income increases by 43% and 217% under scenarios 1 and 2, respectively) due to a larger crop area and crop intensification. Scale effects on labour demand are mainly due to labour intensity of maize in Ecuador, which is disadvantaged in the crop export scenario (an unexpected result). However, expanding irrigated areas would also increase total water and energy demand for irrigation, global warming potential, and freshwater eutrophication. This type of information enables stakeholders and decision-makers to design policies that achieve equitable and sustainable agricultural production, water use, and economic growth.

African landlocked developing countries (LLDCs) continually suffer from an escalating food crisis and water resources and socioeconomic policy and water conservation strategy derived from the water-food nexus of virtual water trade (VWT) systems and resources may be the solution. Using a trade gravity model and multilateral data, this study evaluated grain VW flux patterns and 11 main drivers of VWT between 16 African LLDCs and their partners. Besides, the feedback path of VW flows corresponding to the socio-ecohydrological variability was studied using the impulse response function. The findings revealed that net virtual water import (VWI) varied across all 16 African LLDCs, ranging from 1.67 Bm3 to 10.28 Bm3 during 2000 and 2020, with an estimated yearly grain VWI of 105.61 Bm3. Green, blue, and grey water accounted for about 79.3%, 14.7%, and 5.98% of the total grain VWI, respectively. Ethiopia had the highest grain VWI among the African LLDCs. Grain VWI fluxes were significantly and positively driven by population growth and per capita GDP, which were expected to continue in the future. It was concluded that the quantitative analysis of grain VWT patterns and driving forces using the VW theory for LLDCs can be instrumental for guiding the socioeconomic policy and water conservation strategy. To effectively achieve sustainable water security and grain production, earmarked future VW strategy is required.

However, this technique has the problem that the local nitrate concentration was too high to inhibit the activity of functional microorganisms, which affected the oxidation effect and caused the abnormal release of inorganic nitrogen from the sediment. The slow release of calcium nitrate by tube dosing can effectively solve this disadvantage. However, the specific layout of the dosing method needs further research. Therefore, a method of tube-dosing distribution points was proposed by explored the migration and transformation laws of N-S-Fe in the vertical and horizontal directions of the sediment and the changes in the microbial community structure after the fixed-point dosing of calcium nitrate in this study, which further optimized the calcium nitrate dosing process and provided a new dosing method and idea in practical application.

The 15 farms under the jurisdiction of the Jiansanjiang Branch of the China Beidahuang Land Reclamation Group Co., Ltd., are studied, and a sensitivity analysis is conducted. The results show that the weight design of the comprehensive flood control safety index displays obvious differences among different farms. An analysis of the spatiotemporal evolution of resilience shows that from 1996 to 2004, the resilience in the entire region remained at a relatively low level, and the level in the central region was slightly higher than that in the surrounding areas. From 2004 to 2008, the resilience level of central farms declined, and after that, the resilience levels of central and eastern farms increased significantly. However, by 2020, the Qindeli, Qinglongshan and Qianjin farms only reached level II, experiencing potential flood hazards. In 2008, the main driving force for the decline in the resilience of the Yalvhe, Honghe, Qianjin and Erdaohe farms was the proportion of water conservancy projects in the GDP and the ratio of tertiary industry to GDP.

This review provides an in-depth analysis of studies that assess the role of sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) as nature-based solutions, to tackle this worldwide problem. Sedimentation-based systems, such as wetlands or ponds, and filtration-based systems, such as bioretention cells or gardens, as well as permeable pavements have been shown to effectively retain a significant number of MPs. Nevertheless, it is considered that efficiencies can be enhanced through some design improvements, proposed in this review. Polypropylene, Polyethylene terephthalate, Polyethylene and Polystyrene, are the most frequent and abundant polymers in urban runoff, due to high consumption in a wide variety of urban products and activities. Smaller particles and fibers are the most challenging fraction. Maximum rainfall intensity, antecedent dry days, rainfall depth, land use, dwelling density, imperviousness, hydraulic loading, SUDS age, and the presence of forebays or gross pollutant traps have been influential variables on the abundance of MPs in some of the studies, although not always statistically significant. The assessment of the fate of MPs by some studies indicates that they are more concentrated in the sediment or filter media near the inlet, as well as in the shallower layers. The existence of a similar behaviour and a correlation between total suspended solids and microplastic concentration, makes them a potential indicator of microplastic pollution. A wide variability of microplastic detection methods and reporting data format has been found, which makes it difficult to draw global conclusions.

This paper presents an indicator of clean manufacturing structures based on a dataset of 43,112 valid enterprise cases, and a water quality indicator based on data from 558 cases of chemical oxygen demand. Taking Northeast China as the study area, spatio-temporal diversity and evolution were analysed, and the mechanism of the effect of clean manufacturing structures on water quality was investigated.

Although SWMM has been widely used, little to no research has explored the effect of fitting the same SWMM dataset to multiple hydrologic conditions. This paper assesses the impact of best-fit parameter estimates on the hydrologic responses of dry and wet hydroclimatic conditions, evaluates parameter uncertainty, and identifies the physical processes that govern parameter changes during dry and wet conditions. We compared the ability of SWMM to predict flows when independently calibrated to a dry and a wet year, respectively, using an automatic calibration program for SWMM, OSTRICH-SWMM (Optimization Software Toolkit for Research Involving Computational Heuristics). The model developed using SWMM calibrated to a wet year performed better during the model assessment period. The best fit estimates of SWMM parameters differed significantly between dry and wet years. For instance, Manning's roughness coefficient for overland flow was higher in a dry year, as less runoff meant less flow depth on surfaces. Some parameters, e.g., % effective imperviousness, exhibited an expanded posterior probability distribution, increasing the uncertainty of the parameter estimate. However, other parameters, such as Manning's roughness coefficient for streams were the least sensitive and well-defined as the width of their posterior distribution only spanned a relatively narrow range which did not change drastically between the two cases. The robust assessment conducted in this study demonstrated that the hydrologic behavior of SWMM was different between models developed and calibrated for dry and wet hydroclimatic conditions. The different optimal parameter values suggest that although the processes and mechanisms driving hydrologic processes in dry and wet years are similar, their magnitude differs greatly. This study highlights that precipitation patterns affect the selection of optimal parameter values and the water budgets differed markedly between dry and wet years, as expected. The results of this study can assist urban watershed planners in selecting the most appropriate model to use for prediction purposes or when there is a paucity of data available for model calibration. This study recommends changing SWMM model parameters on an annual basis when projecting the effects of new conditions outside of current experience (i.e., land use and climate change) on urban runoff quantity and quality.

This study proposed a hybrid framework for socioeconomic drought assessment, involving the construction of standardized water supply-demand reliability index (SWSDRI), truncation of drought events, and classification of bivariate drought levels. Using the run theory, socioeconomic drought events and their properties, including duration and severity, were characterized by the SWSDRI series. Then, bivariate socioeconomic drought levels, based on the Kendall frequency of drought duration and severity, were classified using the copula function. Impacts of human activities on socioeconomic drought, including mainly the regulation of reservoirs and water consumption were quantified in the Dongjiang River basin, located in the south of China. Results showed that the framework, based on SWSDRI, facilitated the investigation of socioeconomic drought properties. The joint distributions of drought duration and severity, based on naturalized streamflow and under the individual and total impacts of human activities, were fitted well by the Archimedean copulas. Both drought duration and severity clearly exhibited the slight, moderate, severe, and extreme droughts classified by bivariate drought levels. For naturalized streamflow, socioeconomic drought occurred approximately once a year in the Dongjiang River basin. Design values of the combination of drought duration and severity accounted for 3.4 months and 8.0 hundred million cubic meters of the boundary between slight and moderate droughts, 4.9 months and 13.6 hundred million cubic meters of the boundary between moderate and severe droughts, and 6.9 months and 20.0 hundred million cubic meters of the boundary between moderate and severe droughts, respectively. Under the impact of human activities, in particular the regulation of reservoirs, socioeconomic drought was remarkably alleviated with a decrease of 45.8% in quantity. If the impact of water consumption was considered, drought events in quantitive terms remained almost unchanged, but more extreme and severe droughts occurred, because some slight, moderate, and severe droughts were aggravated by one level. Among the main reservoirs, the impact of the Xinfengjiang reservoir in the period of its operation was remarkable with a decrease in drought events by 47.7%. Under the impact of the Fengshuba reservoirs, drought events changed little in quantitive terms, but more slight droughts occurred because some moderate, severe, and extreme droughts were alleviated.

Likewise, the application of flow duration and mass flow curves in the design of the reservoir capacity, energy generation, water allocation, etc. especially at the tributary reaches is a great challenge mostly due to the lack of information and data records. In this study, we have developed a methodology to obtain the flow duration curve (FDC) and mass flow curve (MFC) in tributary stream stations with the help of estimated streamflow rates. The procedure suggests using two alternative approaches in the selection of the reference station on the mainstream. The streamflow in the reference station is decomposed into direct runoff (DR) and base flow (BF) using one-parameter digital filter method. Together with the precipitation records in the tributary station, the DR and BF on the reference station are then used to estimate the FDC and MFC. The multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) and random forest (RF) methods are used to alternate each other, and the residual of the models are simulated using the autoregressive conditionally heteroscedastic (ARCH) approach to develop the hybrid MARS-ARCH and RF-ARCH models. A data set related to Coruh River Basin, in Turkey is used to confirm the methodology, while results with R 2 ≥ 0.92, reasonable bias, and relative error in the estimation of the expected FDC and MFC rates indicated the robustness of the suggested methodology.

However, its contribution to reduce the antibiotic and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) is still largely unclear. Herein, this study investigated the antibiotics and ARGs removal in AnMBR for real high-strength antibiotic (levofloxacin (LEV)) pharmaceutical wastewater treatment, focusing on the positive effect of membrane fouling layers (biofilms). Results indicated that membrane biofilm has a positive effect on AnMBR treatment with improved COD and LEV removal efficiency by 12% and 10%, respectively. This might be ascribed to the enhanced biodegradation ability of the organic matter by the biofilm due to the enrichment of fermentation bacteria (Anaerobium), hydrogen-producing bacteria (Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1) and hydrogenotrophic methanogenic archaea (Methanobacterium and Methanobrevibacter). Importantly, the membrane biofilm can also effectively mitigate the ARGs (qnrS, qnrA) and class 1 integrator (intI1) dissemination and the absolute abundance of ARGs in the medium fouling (MF) biofilm effluent was 0.27 orders of magnitude lower than that of low fouling (LF) biofilm effluent. This can be explained by the variation of membrane surface becoming more hydrophobic in MF than LF biofilm with increased contact angle and more negative surface zeta potential, suggesting higher adsorption and adhesion properties. The strong correlation between extracellular polymer substance (EPS) and soluble microbial product (SMP) contents and qnrA, qnrS and intI1 further indicated the important role of EPS and SMP in membrane biofilm on ARGs reduction. Furthermore, the entrapment of ARGs potential hosts bacteria of Comamonas and Enterococcus with high biofilm formation potential also attributed to the improved ARGs removal with the increase of membrane fouling degree. Our findings suggest that AnMBR is effective for antibiotic pharmaceutical wastewater treatment and membrane biofilm has a positive effect on antibiotic and ARGs removal, which promotes the AnMBR application in the pharmaceutical industry.

In this paper, a water footprint (WF) sustainability evaluation system was constructed based on three dimensions: environmental, social, and economic. The correlation was used to calculate the weights of the indicators, reducing the influence of human subjectivity on the weights, and the matter element model was used to determine the sustainability of the different indicators and the ease of development to a high sustainability level. The results showed that the WF was unsustainable in 2000, 2001, 2007, and 2008 due to factors such as dry water years and low water use efficiency. The main factors affecting the sustainability of the WF in Heilongjiang Province were the per capita WF, WF composition, and regional social situation. The sustainability level of the WF in Heilongjiang Province in 2018 was at Level II, with a trend toward Level III, and the unsustainable WF in the cities of Harbin, Jixi, Hegang, Qitaihe, and Suihua was the main reason for the unsustainable WF in Heilongjiang Province.

In the context of urbanization, water, energy, and environment (W-E-E) systems are increasingly connected thus can be profiled as a W-E-E nexus. However, research on urban water-energy interactions and their impact on the environment is still in its infancy. In addition, a generic framework for modeling W-E-E nexus that includes dynamic feedbacks between human and natural systems remains elusive. In an attempt to fill this gap, this paper proposes a sensitivity-based framework consisting of four components: the water balance model, the energy balance model, the environmental response model, and the urbanization model. Community sensitivity serves as the missing link, tying together two feedback loops driven by economy and environment respectively. To demonstrate how such a framework could be applied, Wuhan city was selected as a case study and analyzed for its coevolution under three scenarios: extensive development, common development, and sustainable development. The results show that the proposed framework is competent in modeling the W-E-E nexus in Wuhan. The coevolution process is broadly divided into four cyclic stages (expansion, degeneration, convalescence, and stabilization) and environmental recovery consumes decades or more regardless of the development pattern. However, development patterns exert a salient effect on community sensitivity, with +294.4%, +5.5%, and −17.4% for extensive, common, and sustainable development patterns during the simulation period respectively. And only under sustainable development, can Wuhan anticipate achieving the goal of carbon neutrality by the 2060s. It is hoped that this framework will aid our understanding of the fundamental interactions in this complex relationship and allow researchers to improve W-E-E nexus modeling through better capture of the key elements in the feedback loops.

Hence, Guar gum (GG) is used to stabilize the topsoil of loess slopes to control rainwater erosion. To test the engineering performance of GG-stabilized loess and its feasibility in slope protection practice, the mechanical and hydraulic properties of specimens with different GG contents were measured in the laboratory. The results show that GG can effectively improve loess mechanical behavior during shear and disintegration and endow loess with good impermeability and water retention ability. With increasing GG content, the cohesion initially increased and subsequently decreased, the disintegration rate and permeability coefficient decreased, and the height of soil–water characteristic curve increased. When the GG content was 1.0%, the comprehensive engineering performance of the treated specimens was optimized. The cohesion, residual water content, and Van Genuchten (VG) model empirical fitting parameter increased by 125.7%, 148.9%, and 34.5%, while the disintegration rate, permeability coefficient, and VG model scale parameter decreased by 84.3%, 84.1%, and 80%, respectively. According to the scanning electron microscopy images, the stabilization mechanism of GG on loess relied on the hydrogel adhesion of soil particles and pore filling. Finally, field model test was used to verify that the GG-stabilized loess had excellent vegetation growth status and erosion control effect. After 120d of natural rainfall, the vegetation coverage increased by 67.6%, and the cumulative erosion decreased by 47.5%. Thus, utilizing GG-stabilized loess as a slope protection material shows great potential and is expected to promote the green construction of engineering and the sustainable development of soil and water conservation in the CLP.

This research semi-analytically investigates the unsteady solute cloud evolution in channels with suspended vegetation after the point source release on the water surface, by solving the solute transport model with spatially variable flow field coefficients. Results show that regardless of gap ratio (the ratio of the height of the gap region to the water depth) and vegetation density, the solute cloud evolution in the preasymptotic stage (the dimensionless time ⟨ D z * ⟩ t * / h * 2 < 1 , where ⟨ D z * ⟩ is the depth-averaged vertical turbulent diffusion coefficient. t* is the time, and h* is water depth.) can be featured by: the cloud centroid shifts upstream; the longitudinal dispersion coefficient increases; the solute cloud is positively skewed; and the solute accumulates in the vegetation layer on the upstream side and the bottom boundary layer on the downstream side. At around ⟨ D z * ⟩ t * / h * 2 ∼ 1 , the cloud centroid position and the longitudinal dispersion coefficient approach their asymptotic values, and the solute cloud is basically considered to follow the normal distribution longitudinally. In terms of the influences of configurations on the solute cloud during the whole dispersion process, the cloud centroid moves faster and reaches a farther asymptotic location due to a more serious blockage effect for a smaller gap ratio or larger vegetation density. In addition, a small gap ratio enhances the skewness and kurtosis of the cloud, while the vegetation density has little effect on them. Benefiting from the combined action of the violent velocity shear and the strong shear-scale diffusion which dominates the vertical mixing, the smallest gap ratio or highest vegetation density promotes the vertical mixing and yields the largest asymptotic longitudinal dispersion coefficient. Consequently, the vertical concentration distribution is the most uniform and the longitudinal concentration distribution is the flattest in these two cases.

A systematic literature review (SLR) was applied to identify the main variables contributing to the increase in sustainable productivity in freshwater aquaculture and the most used ICT tools to monitor or control these variables. It was found that aquaculture uses IoT and AI mainly on five fronts: water quality, fish feeding, water recirculation, fish transport and traceability, and fish welfare.

In this study, a numerical model is developed that can simulate the two-dimensional surface flow and one-dimensional drainpipe flow simultaneously. Then this model is validated and applied to Macao Peninsula. The compound flood scenarios of storm surge and sea level rise are therefore forecasted, with storm surge return periods of 5-, 10-, 20-, 50-, 100-, and 200-years, and sea level rises by 0 m, 0.5 m and 1.0 m. The overtopping floods caused by storm surges are mainly distributed in the west and northwest of Macao Peninsula. When the sea level rises by 1.0 m, the backflow occurs 2 h earlier than that does under the current sea level. Adding pumping station can reduce backflow and improve drainage efficiency significantly. The effectiveness of the drainage system during floods can be quantified using backflow coefficient and drainage efficiency coefficient, which both decrease as the storm tide level increases. In the worst-case scenario of 200-year-return-period storm surge and 1-m sea level rise, the flooding area accounts for 41.1% of the land area, and the population at risk reaches 68.4% of the total population.

Besides, with the impact of climate change, water scarcity in these areas is likely to get worse in the future.

Thus, isolation and characterization of the microbes with high DNTS-degrading ability is the crucial first step for bioremediation of TNT red water-contaminated sites. Here, a novel bacterial strain, namely Bacillus altitudinis D47, with a high capacity to biodegrade DNTS was isolated and identified from the TNT red water-contaminated soil. The result showed that DNTS content was reduced to 2.05% of the original amount after 3 days inoculation with B. altitudinis D47. LC-MS/MS analysis of DNTS degradation metabolites revealed B. altitudinis D47 reduced nitro-groups on DNTS to hydroxylamino- and/or amino-groups through the activity of nitroreductase (NR). Furthermore, the genome of B. altitudinis D47 was sequenced and assembled, and six NRs were retrieved in the genome.

In this study, we investigated the compositions of chromophoric dissolved organic matter (CDOM) using the absorption index and fluorescence components, examined the quantitative effects of environmental factors on CDOM at the sub-basin scale and identified where and how carbon was produced in the area. The humic-like component (FR5) of CDOM was the main component in the tributaries and the main stream of the YR, especially for the Huangshui River, with FR5 accounting for 58.12%. Water quality parameters greatly affected CDOM in turbid rivers. Dissolved organic carbon and electrical conductivity were positively correlated with the CDOM concentration (p < 0.05), while dissolved oxygen, pH, chlorophyll-a and turbidity significantly affected CDOM composition (p < 0.01). Basin characteristics exerted significant influences on CDOM. The spectral slope (S 275-295) increased as the altitude of the sub-basins increased. The percentage of built-up area exerted the most significant effects on CDOM composition, with high correlations with tryptophan-like protein (FR2) and FR5 (r > 0.59, p < 0.01). Forest percentage and grassland percentage showed positive correlations with CDOM concentration (r = 0.36, p < 0.05) and S 275-295 (r = 0.30, p < 0.05), respectively. Moreover, the discharge from rivers in the YR Basin showed that the carbon flux of rivers in the YR Basin is more likely to be limited by dissolved organic matter (DOM) sources although negative but nonsignificant effects of discharges on CDOM parameters were shown. Consequently, additional research is necessary to clarify this correlation. This research is crucial and necessary for improving the accuracy of CDOM evaluation with remote sensing, revealing the influencing mechanisms and monitoring carbon cycling.

There is little research on sponges that can be used for comprehensive treatment of oil-water mixtures, emulsions and high viscosity oils. We prepared a graphene melamine sponge (rGOMS) adsorbent material with special wettability for oil water separation by loading rGO on melamine sponge. The results showed that the water contact angle of the rGOMS prepared with GO concentration of 4.5 mol/mL (4.5-rGOMS) was 153.3° and the oil contact angle in air was 0°, indicating that 4.5-rGOMS has superhydrophobicity and superlipophilicity. The 4.5-rGOMS possessed a high saturation sorption capacity, which had values between 54.6 g/g and 132.9 g/g, and did not decrease significantly after several cycles. 4.5-rGOMS had a fast separation capacity for carbon tetrachloride/water mixtures and water-in-oil emulsions, and could achieve efficient continuous separation of n-hexane-water mixtures by connecting a peristaltic pump.

To meet these targets, the scientific community has been proposing new technologies to improve energy conversion efficiency of renewable energy powered thermal systems. The present research examines heat recovery from commercial kitchen grease traps (GT) as a means of reducing the net energy requirement of commercial hot water use in food related activities. A GT was integrated with heat recovery unit and is referred to as a hybrid GT system. Two designs of thermal recovery units comprising a planar and rectangular coil type heat exchanger (HX) were assessed individually to compare their thermal recovery capabilities. The planar HX equipped GT was first experimentally investigated and subsequently examined in more detail using 3D numerical analysis. Thermal stratification was observed along the GT depth for which the rectangular HX showed greater potential for thermal recapture from the high temperature kitchen wastewater. The novel rectangular HX design was found to save 2.6 kW of thermal energy in the kitchen GT and was 48% more efficient compared to the planar HX. The proposed GT hybrid design enables more sustainable production of food via a clean auxiliary thermal back-up, reducing greenhouse gases emission released in water heating. Heat recovery from commercial kitchen GTs has been shown in this study to be technically viable with strong potential for economic viability and positive environmental impact through reducing the carbon footprint of water heating.";"2023-06-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623009575";"10";"Water Other"

In this study, the Upper Yangtze River (UYZ) located in hinterland of the Tibetan Plateau was selected for assessing spatiotemporal variations in WRSV, predicting future WRSV and identifying the main influencing factors of WRSV. The spatiotemporal variations in WRSV were estimated based on a framework including sensitivity, exposure, hazard and adaptability, which considered impact of both natural and human activities on WRSV. Moreover, the main influencing factors of WRSV and its future evolution were obtained based on SPHY (Spatial Processes in Hydrology) model, GCMs (General Circulation Models) and attribution analysis. The average WRSV of the UYZ corresponded to medium-low grades during 2001–2019. Overall, the value and increasing trend of WRSV in downstream areas were higher than that of upstream areas. Under various scenarios (SSP 1–2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) with global warming of 1.5 °C and 2 °C, the average WRSV would continue to be of medium-low grade. However, the average WRSV of the basin and the area ratio for medium vulnerability and medium-high vulnerability would increase. As the main influencing factor, the hazard level contributed to more than 93% of the change in WRSV during both the historical and future periods. The results indicated that climate change may increase the WRSV of the UYZ and suitable countermeasures would be required to better cope with the impact of climate change on the water resources system. These findings provide a scientific basis for designing adaptive strategies to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change and achieve social and economic sustainable development.

However, the SWAT has apparent defects in the process of ecohydrological simulation in mid-high latitudes and arid regions. This model can merely be used in agricultural catchments with gentle slopes and uniform rainfall, and the simulation is not suitable for high-altitude alpine catchment. To this point, this paper makes appropriate improvements to the runoff module, and specifically corrects the key sensitive parameters. The global sensitivity and performance assessment of the model's parameters were carried out before and after the improvement using the monthly data of runoff and evaporation from 1990 to 2018 in the Kaidu River basin in northwestern China. It is indicated that the Modified SWAT simulates the performance of monthly runoff and evapotranspiration better than the original SWAT, which overestimates the runoff volume throughout hydrological changes in different periods. Compared with the monthly water production under different land use/cover conditions, the highest water production was found in forest and grassland. By modifying the SWAT algorithm, the structural non-determinacy of the Modified SWAT is significantly reduced, and the adaptability of the model is improved. Thus, the Modified SWAT shows a better simulation performance in arid areas with considerable terrain variation and scarce rainfall data.

The water-land-food nexus in agricultural irrigation systems is receiving increasing attention. However, for sustainable food production, land and water resources must be managed effectively. The allocation of agricultural water and land resource components involves a large amount of uncertainty regarding readily available water. A robust optimization model of water-land-food nexus for agricultural irrigation systems is presented in this study, which comprehensively considers the uncertainty of the system and optimizes the allocation of scarce water and land resources for diverse crops to maximize irrigation system productivity. Using the Yellow River Basin as a case study, the results revealed that the developed optimization model can successfully resolve the system uncertainty perturbation and provide the finest potential allocation of water and land resources. Its irrigation system productivity can attain 1.6843–1.7143 kg/m3, which is improved by 6.6%–8.5%, and it can also reveal the interaction between WLF-nexus systems. This study also discovered that crop type and proportion can be modified to improve resource-use efficiency based on regional water and land resource endowment.

We present a new method of spatialising pesticide sales in France to monitor environmental policies on a territorial scale. Data on pesticide sales in France are available yearly at a postal code resolution. Our spatialisation model combines parcel-scale land use data with information on pesticide types and applied doses, based on legal authorisations for pesticide use in France. We compared the performance of our new model with that of a simple surface fraction model in two distinct territories: Bourville (830 ha, Normandy), a small catchment composed of two small postal code fractions with available ground truth data about pesticide application, and Pleine-Fougères (12,007 ha, Britany), a larger area with a single postal code comprising seven municipalities with contrasting inter-municipal land uses and no ground truth information about pesticide application. For the Bourville site, due to homogeneous land use, the new model was no better than the simple model for global pesticide use, but it performed better when the results were analysed by crop type. For the Pleine-Fougères site, the new model was effective in distinguishing the use of pesticides by municipality, whereas the simple model was not. Our results demonstrate that our new model improves pesticide use quantification at a territorial level and can provide valid support for monitoring public policies regarding water quality and pesticide use over time and space.

Coastal groundwater is affected by natural conditions and strong human activities, and the evolution of water quality is extremely complex. Information on the hydrochemistry evolution and nitrate contamination status of coastal groundwater under the conjunctive effects of natural processes and human activities is a vital requirement for groundwater resource management in coastal regions. Thus, this study integrated traditional hydrochemical analysis approaches, the entropy-weight water quality index (EWQI), and the health risk assessment model to analyze hydrochemical characteristics, quality, and nitrate health risks in a typical coastal region (i.e., southern Laizhou Bay) simultaneously affected by seawater intrusion and anthropogenic activities, as well as to explore the dominant mechanisms controlling groundwater quality. The results indicated that the concentrations of major hydrochemical constituents in groundwater exhibited wide variability. The N O 3 − concentration varied from 0.59 to 824.80 mg/L; it surpassed the WHO drinking water standard (50 mg/L) at 89.47% of sampling sites. The predominant hydrochemical types of groundwater were SO4•Cl–Ca•Mg and HCO3–Ca•Mg. Governing factors influencing groundwater chemistry were recognized as rock weathering, inverse cation exchange and anthropogenic activities, and nitrate contents were largely controlled by agricultural practices. The computed EWQI showed that 55.26% of groundwater samples possessed EWQI values greater than 57, which is relatively poor-quality groundwater. The poor-quality groundwater was concentrated in the southwestern part of the study area. Non-cancer risks of nitrate in 96.71%, 94.74%, 89.47%, and 89.47% of the groundwater samples were unacceptable for infants, children, teens, and adults, and the spatial distribution of the hazard quotient (HQ) was in accordance with the spatial pattern of nitrate concentration.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as emerging contaminants have been found frequently in aquatic environments, including waters that are seasonally covered in ice. However, little is available for the environmental behaviors and fate of NSAIDs in ice, particularly in the system where ice and water coexist. In this study, the distribution and photodegradation of model NSAIDs naproxen (NPX), diclofenac (DCF), and acetaminophen (APAP) in an ice-water system were investigated. The findings demonstrated a 66.7%, 60.5%, and 66.7% increase in the ice-water distribution coefficient K iw of NPX, DCF, and APAP with initial concentrations of 10 ng L−1 relative to 500 ng L−1. The K iw values were in decreased order of DCF, NPX, and APAP. The photodegradation rate constants of NPX, DCF, and APAP in ice increased by 27.0%, 35.6%, and 56.6% relative to those in water.

However, the fate of conventionally contaminated elements such as nitrogen in this process still warrants further research to control potential contamination. In this work, uric acid was used as the model compound of nitrogenous components in chicken manure to investigate the transformation mechanism of nitrogen during the SCWG process. The effects of different temperatures (550–650 °C) and residence times (2–30 min) on the gasification characteristic of uric acid and the behaviour of nitrogen were experimentally explored. The results indicated that the higher temperatures and longer residence time significantly facilitated the uric acid gasification and nitrogen transformation. The maximum nitrogen conversion efficiency was 84.83%, and the maximum yield of NH3, H2, and CO2 reached 20.20 mol/kg, 23.78 mol/kg, and 20.10 mol/kg at 650 °C and 30 min, respectively. Subsequently, the reaction pathways of nitrogen in uric acid were proposed in detail according to the product analysis. Finally, a kinetic model was developed to describe the SCWG process, especially the reaction kinetic of nitrogenous products. The results revealed that the hydrolysis reactions of uric acid led to a rapid increase in NH3 yield in the initial stage of the SCWG process.

Further, the paper comprehensively analyzes the relative water scarcity degree across different zones, using the Structural Equation Model (SEM) to identify the main factors affecting the WPI and the contribution rate of each factor.

Concerning this issue, the present study aimed to identify the optimal water-saving cultivation pattern in the field cropping's subsector in Qazvin province.

By establishing a comprehensive assessment system incorporating SDGs progress evenness, this study has assessed water stress and its impact on sustainable development in Inner Mongolia, a typical and representative area of Eurasian drylands. Our results suggest that although Inner Mongolia has experienced rapid progress towards its SDGs, disregarding the evenness of SDGs progress overestimates the current situation and ignores regional gaps. Many poorly performing SDGs have made little progress over the past few decades, thus intensifying uneven progress goals. Further analyses have examined how water resources are associated with these problems. Moreover, multiple SDGs related to human essential needs and environmental conservation, including SDG 1 (no poverty), SDG 2 (zero hunger), SDG 3 (good health and well-being), SDG 7 (affordable and clean energy), and SDG 12 (responsible consumption and production), were significantly positively correlated with ecological water consumption, whereas SDGs related to economic growth, such as SDG 8 (decent work and economic growth), were positively correlated with industrial water consumption. These findings suggest that a conflict in water allocation for the achievement of different SDGs accounts for the uneven progress across the SDGs and therefore this impedes the sustainable development of these drylands.

The impact of climate change on water availability makes it more challenging. This paper demonstrates the analysis of the water, energy, and food resource nexus of a bioeconomy-based industrial complex and future climate change impact. The model structure consists of cultivation, crop processing, and urban sectors. Sugarcane is the major crop in the case study area and is the main bioeconomy crop. The results indicate that the average sugarcane yield will be lower than the minimum industrial goal for the 2020s and 2030s decades. Consequently, sugarcane feedstock shortage may often occur. The drought situation tends to be increased, so groundwater resources can be the main reserve source of water. In all improvement scenarios on water supply management, nexus energy used for water acquisition was mainly for groundwater acquisition. Direct energy use in the cultivation process is high and fossil fuels based, while most of the energy used in processing came from biomass waste. This implies that technologies for water acquisition will be more important in the future and should be developed in terms of energy efficiency and the aspect of promoting the usage of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gases and fossil fuels use.

An additional irrigation water supply of about 250 mm and expansion to cover more than 90% of the cultivation area should be considered to secure the minimum supply of sugarcane for the local biorefinery complex in the following decades.

However, studies on degradation products of FQs by VFCWs and ecological risks assessment have been very limited so far. The degradation of FQs by VFCWs under different hydraulic loads was investigated in this study. The results showed all VFCWs had high removal efficiencies of FQs under either high hydraulic load (above 80%) or low hydraulic load (above 95%). Only one degradation product of FQs was detected and the ecotoxicity declined significantly under low hydraulic load. Six degradation products of FQs were detected and the ecotoxicity had also been reduced in general under high hydraulic load. Cytochrome P450 and enzymes with acetyl transfer activity were directly related to the degradation of FQs. The most dominant ARGs in this experiment was qnrD and the relative abundance of qnrD in effluent of device-A, device-B, device-C and device-D were 93.0%, 94.4%, 85.6% and 89.0% lower than that in influent.

In this study, three common physical control treatments for S. alterniflora were simulated in the laboratory environment. The results showed that “mowing + flooding” (MF) and “mowing + ploughing” (MP) treatments eradicated S. alterniflora completely during the 60-day experiment. However, the flooding and ploughing treatments and the decay of S. alterniflora would change the biogeochemical feature of the sediment, resulting in the abnormal release of nutrients. Spearman's correlation analysis and water quality analysis results showed that the average concentrations of NH4 +-N (1.80 mg/L) and TP (0.43 mg/L) in MF treatment, as well as NH4 +-N (1.49 mg/L), NO3 −-N (0.95 mg/L), and NO2 −-N (0.35 mg/L) in MP treatment greatly increased due to the migration and transformation of nutrient. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) confirmed that three components of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and their rising in overlying water were related to the decomposition of S. alterniflora and the disturbed sediment, which could increase the risk of eutrophication in offshore water bodies. In addition, three physical control treatments changed the structure and composition of the bacterial community by altering the colonization of specific bacteria and the sediment microenvironment. Mantel test analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that the variation of key nutrients in MF and MP treatments had significant impacts on bacterial community structure. This study revealed the effects of physical control of S. alterniflora on migration and transformation mechanism of nutrients in coastal wetlands and the structure of the bacterial community.

Due to spatial differences in geographic background and economic development, proportioning these elements according to global, regional and local scales is a necessity for sustainability governance. Achieving SDG targets requires guidance according to SJOS environmental and social boundaries. Here, integrating planetary boundaries (PBs) with the SJOS framework is explored and focused towards the sub-watershed scale in the Chaohu watershed, China. Assessment of environmental and socio-economic dimension changes in this watershed incorporates data taken from long-term monitoring, surveys and anthropogenic impact records in lake sediment sequences. These are used to explore spatial and temporal differences in key environmental change processes and social well-being measures in the watershed. The interrelationships with identified prioritized PB limitation indicators within the sub-watersheds were evaluated numerically. Results indicate four PB biogeophysical dimensions, water quality, chemical pollution, air pollution and ozone depletion all operate in the Chaohu watershed and exceed safe boundary limits. However, large differences exist between the four main sub-watersheds. Environmental pressures in the two western sub-watersheds are considerably greater than those in eastern regions. Most social indicators selected for the whole watershed conform well to PB limits considered necessary for achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs), especially food (SDG 2), health (SDG 3), sanitation services (SDG 6c) and consumption (SDG 12). Based on quantifiable environmental change trends in each sub-watershed and social development in the last decades, we identify, water quality, chemical pollution, and soil stability PB dimensions as exceeding safe operation limits. These dimensions are prioritized for environmental management and harmonization with SDG targets. Water utilization intensity (SDG 6a) and forest cover (SDG 15) are social development priorities across the whole Chaohu watershed. Redundancy analysis identified GDP per capita as well as changes in forest and vegetation cover as key drivers of environmental degradation throughout the watershed. While not all 17 SDGs are considered, initial results of this study provide a rational base for informing systems management and policy, guiding the attainment of SDG targets, and communicating the importance of revealing environmental change trends. Requirements for sustainable development of human society locally and regionally are, within limits of the data available, identified by matching SJOS boundaries with SDG targets. Strengthening time-track data for the key drivers of change and combining with emerging socio-economic factors is needed to better define specific SDG progress in terms of achieving calibrated environmental boundaries.

Despite efforts to sustain water distribution networks (WDNs), they often experience frequent failures, leading to several environmental, social, and economic consequences. Previous studies have investigated the causes of water pipe failure in different contexts. However, a comprehensive and holistic understanding of these causes is lacking in the literature. Therefore, this study contributes to the existing knowledge by presenting 1) a scientometric analysis of the previous literature, 2) a systematic discussion of the causes, 3) an Analytical Hierarchy Process model and fault tree logic to prioritize and map the causes, respectively, and 4) an overview of techniques used in developing failure prediction models. The scientometric analysis reveals that little attention has been paid generally to the operational causes of water pipe failure. The same trend was supported by the systematic review, which divides a total of 33 causes into three main categories: pipe-related, environment-related, and operation-related causes.

The input of HTC-PW changed the aquatic DOM components, such as the C1–C3 component decreased by 51.92–100%, and the C4 component increased by 81.40–100%. HTC-PW promoted the development of Proteobacteria and Firmicutes with relative abundance ratios of 1.75–2.31 and 1.4−3.25 times higher than CK, with a positive association revealed with the carbon conversion indicators. Furthermore, Proteobacteria play a critical role in bacterial networks exposed to high-temperature HTC-PW due to the facilitated nutrient exchange and metabolite. The prevalence of Ciliophora and Chlorophyta positively correlated with the nutrient compounds of HTC-PW. Moreover, the higher percentage of positive correlation in fungal networks was 75.26%, which implicated that microbial cooperation of fungi was more pronounced on an equal footing exposed to low-temperature HTC-PW.

In this paper, we propose a new methodology for assessing ESs-based resilience, taking into account the seven resilience principles: a) redundancy and diversity, b) managing connectivity, c) managing slow variables and their feedback, d) complex adaptive system (CAS) thinking, e) experimentation and learning, f) broadening participation, and g) polycentric governance. These principles enable us to consider the main social, political, hydrological, economic, and environmental aspects concerning resilience which have been overlooked in previous studies. The methodology is evaluated by applying it to Zarrinehroud River Basin (ZRB) in north-western Iran. A set of qualitative and quantitative criteria and their sub-criteria are proposed for quantifying the ES-based resilience and generating time series of resilience against severe droughts in several sub-basins in the study area. To evaluate the criteria and sub-criteria, the required data are derived from calibrated SWAT and MODSIM models as well as experts’ judjments. The time series of ES-based resilience under 128 Water and Environmental Resources Management (WERM) scenarios (for enhancing agricultural practices, altering and modernizing irrigation methods, improving irrigation network and drainage facilities) and Climate Change (CC) scenarios (RCP 4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP 8.5) are derived for each sub-basin based on short-term (2020–2049) and long-term (2020–2098) periods. The low resilience values (0.53–0.6) of all sub-basins under the base management scenario (the status quo scenario (SC0)) illustrate the need for implementing some projects to enhance the ESs in the study area. The results show that the WERM scenario SC12346 can improve the values of the resilience criterion in sub-basins up to 0.85 and reduce the vulnerability of the study area to droughts. By evaluating all management scenarios, scenario SC12346 is reported as the best scenario, since it can significantly increase the resilience of all sub-basins against extreme droughts with an acceptable cost of 636 million US dollars compared to other scenarios. Under this WERM scenario, the resilience values of sub-basins increase up to 40%. This scenario suggests implementing a set of projects such as improving irrigation networks and drainage facilities.

An objective zoning technology for ECSWs was recommended in this paper to tackle problems such as soil erosion and water pollution efficiently. Taking eight typical ECSWs in Changping District of Beijing as a case study, the essential data, including the land use, digital elevation, administrative division, leaf area index and annual precipitation, can be initially accessed. Subsequently, two topographic features (i.e., elevation and slope) and seven ecosystem disservices (i.e., collapse risks, debris flow risks, nitrogen pollution, phosphorus pollution, sediment export, quick flow and surface runoff) were evaluated and quantified based on Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) and Geographic Information System (GIS). The quantitative attribute matrix was herein operated as a calculation object of k-means clustering and entropy-weighted TOPSIS for the classification and delineation.

Although researchers have conducted numerous studies on the water damage resistance of steel slag asphalt concrete, the evaluations are inconsistent, and it is difficult to distinguish the weighting ratios of the factors influencing the moisture sensitivity of asphalt concrete in the current study. Based on the water immersion Marshall test, freeze-thaw splitting test, and Hamburg rutting test, this study tested the water stability of asphalt concrete prepared from steel slag by different processes, aiming to illustrate the influence of the preparation process of aggregates on the water sensitivity of asphalt concrete. The results showed that the water stability of asphalt concrete prepared from steel slag obtained by the roller method and the hot smothering method was better than that of limestone asphalt concrete, while the water stability of asphalt concrete prepared from steel slag was inferior to that of limestone concrete. Subsequently, the adhesion between the three steel slag and limestone respectively and asphalt was compared in the modified boiling method, and the surface morphology structure of the four aggregates was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the results showed that the adhesion between the aggregates and asphalt was consistent with the moisture sensitivity of asphalt concrete. Finally, the comprehensive analysis concluded that the main factors affecting the water stability of steel slag asphalt concrete were asphalt, aggregate, gradation, and particle size, in that order.

Previous studies have analyzed many individual factors affecting ESB on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). However, there is limited knowledge on the scale dependence of the driving factors at different levels. In this study, we selected and assessed vegetation carbon uptake reduction (VCR), water supply index (WSI), and mean species abundance (MSA) on the QTP during 2000–2020, which can represent carbon sequestration, water yield ecosystem services, and biodiversity intactness, respectively. Then, we unutilized the hierarchical linear model (HLM) to determine the impacts of natural factors at the eco-functional zone level and socioeconomic factors at the city level on the three indices. The results showed that the spatial distribution of VCR and WSI had a generally gradual declining trend, and MSA had an increasing trend from the southeast to the northwest from 2000 to 2020. At the eco-functional zone level, degradation of forest and grassland had the greatest, most negative effects on carbon uptake and MSA. Potential evapotranspiration rather than precipitation had the strongest and most positive influence on the WSI. At the city scale, rural per capita net income, GDP, and meat production dominated the decrease in VCR, WSI, and MSA, respectively. The eco-functional zone was nested into the city, population, and economic controlled ESB mainly through its effect on land use, especially grassland. VCR and MSA were mainly affected by natural factors, while WSI was affected by socioeconomic factors. Overall, our study provides a reference for analyzing the multilevel factors that affect the sustainability of ESB.

At present, the treatment technology usually starts from the treatment of MPW at a wastewater treatment station. However, the treatment cost is inevitably high due to the huge amount of MPW. In this study, a new process of removing residual BHA-Pb complex reagent from MPW in one-step using metal ions combined with gangue minerals in tailings pulp was proposed. It started from tailings pulp treatment and taking tailings reservoir as the main reaction site. The basic issues related to the new process were mainly studied. The concentration of BHA was characterized using chemical oxygen demand (COD). The results show that when Ca2+, Fe3+, or Al3+ was added to the BHA-Pb solution, only Fe3+ could effectively remove the COD of the BHA-Pb solution, while Ca2+ and Al3+ could not. This is because the BHA-Pb complex can be preferentially transformed into the BHA-Fe complex, and the COD of the BHA-Fe complex solution is most easily removed. However, BHA-Fe complex systems have dark colors and are difficult to settle. When gangue minerals are added to the BHA-Fe complex system, gangue minerals can play the role of coarse particles carrying fine particles settling, which is helpful to the sedimentation of the BHA-Fe complex system. The transformation mechanism between BHA-Pb and BHA-Fe complexes was explained by the conditional stability constants and Gibbs free energy changes analysis. In addition, the sedimentation mechanism of the BHA-Fe complex system was analyzed by zeta potential and scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectrometer. This study provides a new idea for removing residual organic flotation reagents from MPW starting from tailings pulp treatment.

In the present study, lab-scale CWs amended with a biochar substrate and operated in tidal flow (TF) mode were used to treat SDS-containing greywater. The results showed that the biochar-amended CWs removed NH4 +-N significantly better (18.2–37.9%) than the gravel-only CWs (2.5–24.6%) but removed phosphorus (P) and COD less efficiently, and the feeding of SDS at 50 and 100 mg/L led to a notable decrease in N removal. TF not only notably improved the pollutant removal performance but also effectively eliminated SDS stress in the CWs (NH4 +-N removal of 67.1–72.1%). Mean SDS removal efficiencies of 75.3–79.3% were obtained in the CWs. TF mode altered the microbial community structure and metabolic pattern and enhanced the abundance of functional bacteria related to N and P removal in the CWs.

FEW is embedded throughout the upstream production and downstream consumption processes via the supply chain dominated by economic activities. In the context of rapid population growth and increasing resource scarcity, it is crucial to reveal the trade-offs and synergies among regions and sectors from the perspective of supply chain for achieving regional sustainability. This study constructed a China's multi-regional and multi-sector FEW flow network and identified the critical supply chains and nodes. The efficiencies and benefits of the critical supply chains were evaluated through integrating multiple dimensions of socio-economic benefits, resource availability and negative environmental impacts. Additionally, this study also assessed the regional livelihood well-being related to the FEW nexus in terms of three dimensions: availability, accessibility and stability. The impacts of the FEW subsystems and their interactions on livelihood well-being were thus analyzed. The results indicated that: 1) agriculture, food processing industry, and construction industry were the critical nodes of the FEW nexus in China; 2) some critical supply chains and nodes were inefficient due to resource waste or negative environmental impacts; 3) the level of livelihood well-being related to the FEW nexus in most regions didn't match the economic development level and position in supply chains.

A purple roof is conceptually and technically different from a green roof in that the former includes a low-transmissivity drainage layer and a void layer that can be designed at various depths for the temporary storage and slow release of water. Three types of roofs, i.e., (i) traditional, (ii) green and (iii) purple, were constructed in Western Sydney, Australia. These roofs were investigated and compared in terms of runoff reduction capacity, time to start runoff and time to release the runoff. Data were collected across the period from April 2021 to May 2022. A total of 76 rainfall events were recorded during this period. It was found that the purple roof performed better than other roof systems during all the rainfall events. The purple roof delayed the median start times of runoff by 773, 211 and 86 min for small, medium and large rainfall events, respectively, compared to a traditional roof, and 110, 59 and 14 min, respectively, compared to a green roof. During small rainfall events, the purple roof retained 100% of the water on most occasions. For medium, large, and extremely large events, the median runoff volume reductions by the purple roof were 88%, 34% and 7%, and 55%, 21% and 10% than those of the traditional and green roofs, respectively. In addition to reducing the volume discharged, the purple roof took 242 and 113 min (median values) longer to discharge the stormwater compared to the traditional roof during medium and large events, respectively, and 226 and 66 min (median values) longer than the green roof. In the case of median times for extremely large events, the purple roof took 503 min longer to release stormwater than the traditional roof, and 74 min longer than the green roof. The outcomes from this study proved the technical feasibility of the purple roof technology to slow the release and reduce the volume of stormwater during different-sized rainfall events. Thus, a purple roof can potentially be used to replace the traditional detention basins in a dense urban environment to reduce flood risks.

The majority of industrial water resource management frameworks currently in use fall short in their attempts to perform microscopic section accounting and analysis and are unable to fully obtain and effectively implement product information regarding water. This unquestionably made it more challenging to pinpoint the effects of production pollution, accomplish efficient water conservation in industry, and raise the bar for meticulous management of water resources. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel framework for water accounting and auditing that combines traditional water accounting and water mass balance for measuring, evaluating, and diagnosing water flowing in various production links as well as water finance, to facilitate the effective management of industrial water resources and their integration with enterprise benefits management. Specifically, the framework suggests a new accounting structure that successfully connects the conventional water accounting system with the exact quantitative and economic accounting of industrial production links by revamping the title and substance of water accounting. As opposed to traditional water accounting and industrial water mass balance analysis, this will further improve the system's ability to track internal, intricate production links and the economics of industrial water management, respectively.

Water management in this basin is beset by poor water-allocation policies that do not adequately meet diverse demands (potable, agriculture, industry, and environmental demands). The Gavkhouni basin suffers from water scarcity and unmet water demands; especially with respect to environmental requirements. Water allocation considering appropriate priorities for all demands would be a major improvement for environmental protection in the Gavhouni basin. The application of the environmental flow in Integrated Water Resource Management offers practical options for water management in the Gavkhouni basin. Environmental flow describes the quantity, timing, and quality of water flow required to sustain freshwater, estuarine ecosystems, the human livelihoods, and well-being. A water resources management model is developed in this study for the purpose of improved water management in the Gavkhouni basin. The model involves six stages. The first stage implements a survey of resources and water use. The Environmental flow is calculated in the second stage with the hydraulic method and the Hydrologic Engineering Center- River Analysis System. The third stage applies the calculated environmental flow to the Integrated Water Resource Management approach by means of the Water Evaluation and Planning model. The fourth stage creates seven possible management scenarios in the Water Evaluation and Planning model to be applied in the period ending in the year 2041. These scenarios are ranked in the fifth stage with a multi-criteria decision-making method. The sixth stage applies the best management scenario in the study region. This study's results indicate that the annual drinking water demand under current conditions would rise from 547.6 to 760.2 Mm3 by 2041. The annual industrial water demand is estimated to increase from 213.7 to 400.5 Mm3, and the agricultural water demand is projected to remain constant at 1789.1 Mm3 per yr. The annual drinking water, environmental, industrial, and agricultural unmet demands are estimated to increase from 68.1, 106.5, 73.4, and 470 to 130.1, 186.1, 141.4, and 480 Mm3, respectively.

However, algae-bacteria consortium biofilm-forming mechanism has rarely been studied in wastewaters including soy sauce wastewater (SW). In this study, we conducted algal biofilm cultivation in raw SW (RSW) and sterilized SW (SSW), and determined the characteristics of algal biofilm and its EPS in the two SW treatments. The results demonstrated that the co-existing bacteria in the algal biofilm system significantly enhanced attached biomass and nutrient removal from RSW, compared to SSW without bacteria. The enhancement may be attributed to EPS excreted by dominated Acinetobacter and Comamonas (both Proteobacteria) in the co-existing bacteria community. The algae-bacteria consortium from algal biofilm in RSW excreted the contents of relatively high tightly bound EPS (TB-EPS) and its proteins (TB-PN), which were conducive to forming the algal biofilm. The high TB-EPS content was related to soluble microbial by-product-like substances (mainly proteins), and its high TB-PN content was mainly caused by the increases in hydrophobic glycine and serine contents for stable biofilm formation. Based on these results, we enhanced our understanding of the formation mechanism of algal biofilm in SW remediation, which provided the theoretical basis for biofilm formation by algae-bacteria synergism.

The biological co-metabolism process provides carbon sources and energy for microorganisms through co-substrate addition, thereby producing enzymes or cofactors to enhance the degradation of refractory pollutants. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the degradation performance of CTX through anaerobic biological co-metabolism. A simple co-metabolic substrate (i.e., glucose, 80 mg L−1) was added into an anaerobic-activated sludge system, and its mechanism was explored in terms of the variations in extracellular polymeric substances, microbial structure, and resistance genes. Additionally, the possible degradation pathways of CTX were described. The results showed that the degradation efficiency of CTX (200 mg L−1) was only about 35% within 8 h in the control group, while it increased to 67.6% in the experimental group with glucose. Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes ADurb.Bin123, and Bacteroidales were the predominant bacterial species in the system. Additionally, the types of enzymes and the relative abundance of β-lactam resistance genes in the co-metabolic system significantly increased by 7 and 0.77%, respectively. Furthermore, nine primary anaerobic CTX biodegradation products were detected, indicating the existence of three possible degradation pathways. Overall, the study results provide a novel approach to treating CTX-containing wastewater. ";"2023-03-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623005462";"20";"Water Other"

Here, nine constructed wetlands (CWs) with different configurations (i.e., substrate, plants, and hydraulic retention time) were prepared by orthogonal test [L9 (33)], to treat aquaculture wastewater and specifically to evaluate the removal efficiency and mechanism of antibiotics. Consequently, the highest removal percentages of trimethoprim (89 ± 3%), sulfamethoxazole (61 ± 7%), sulfamonomethoxine (20 ± 8%), sulfamethazine (20 ± 9%), and sulfadiazine (12 ± 13%) were achieved via collocating optimal configuration of CWs. Based on the analysis of both the orthogonal test and correlation, microbial degradation was the major removal pathway of antibiotics, particularly anaerobic processes. Further, 16S rRNA sequencing analysis presented that some specific substrate, plants, and hydraulic retention time might promote antibiotic removal via changing dominant and functional microbes by deciding oxygen concentrations and redox conditions in CWs. In which, anaerobic bacteria (e.g., Lacihabitans and Ilumatobacter) were regarded as the key microorganisms in the genus level for removing antibiotics by CWs through redundancy analysis (RDA), while aerobic bacteria (e.g., Hydrogenophaga and Pseudomonas) were likely to significantly inhibit the anaerobic process of antibiotic degradation.

The underlying hydrodynamic mechanism ";" Selective withdrawal is considered an effective and convenient method to mitigate thermal pollution and environmental problems in reservoirs and downstream rivers. However, the potential effects of selective withdrawal on harmful algal blooms in reservoirs remain uncertain, threatening sustainable reservoir management. This study developed and calibrated a three-dimensional (3D) hydro-ecological model for the Zipingpu reservoir to numerically investigate how selective withdrawal scenarios (including surface, middle, and bottom withdrawal) affect algal growth and hydrodynamic environments. The surface withdrawal scenario could inhibit algal growth efficiently, causing Chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration below 10 μg L−1 consistently. The Chl a concentration decreased from 27.0 μg L−1 for bottom withdrawal and 21.2 μg L−1 for middle withdrawal to 3.3 μg L−1 for surface withdrawal in the bloom period. The nutrient, light, and temperature limitations among the three withdrawal scenarios showed slight differences and were not the main reason for the bloom differences. Compared with the bottom and middle withdrawal scenarios, the surface withdrawal scenario weakened stratification and decreased surface water temperature, suggesting inhibitory effects on algal blooms. The bottom and middle withdrawal scenarios significantly reduced surface flow velocity and made the flow direction against the water intake, indicating a favorable hydrodynamic environment for algal growth. The surface withdrawal scenario reduced hydraulic residence time, thereby restraining algal growth and accumulation in the reservoir. Implementing surface withdrawal might be an efficient and promising method to prevent algal blooms in reservoirs. These results not only highlight the potential of selective withdrawal for algal bloom control but also reveal that accelerating surface flow velocity is the key mechanism.

The system was evaluated for its ability to degrade tetracycline (TC), inactivate antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) and remove ARGs. The degradation efficiency of TC in the NLBH/PDS system (70.1%) was higher than that in the pristine biochar/PDS system (10.3%). It was confirmed that the defects and edge pyridinic nitrogen generated in the nitrogen doping process were the reactive sites for PDS activation. According to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and radical quenching experiments, the major mechanism for PDS activation was a non-radical pathway dominated by singlet oxygen (1O2). Radical pathways involving sulfate (SO4·-) and hydroxyl radicals (·OH) were also at play in the NLBH/PDS system, but their role was minor. TC was principally degraded by hydroxylation, demethylation, and decarboxylation, and within 90 min, the NLBH/PDS system effectively inactivated 71.5% of ARB (Pseudomonas sp. HLS-6). Intracellular ARGs (iARGs; sul1, sul2) and intI1 had log reduction efficiencies of 2.73–4.04 and 2.70, respectively, whereas, extracellular ARGs (sul1 and sul2) and intI1 accumulated noticeably by 1.52–4.18-and 4.92-log, respectively.

The objective of this research was to study the spatial distribution of runoff and sediment load in river Quito (Choco, Colombia), which is affected by extreme gold mining practices. Long-term daily mean discharge data from gauging stations were analyzed. The runoff values of 297, 210 and 141 m3/s have exceeded (in %) 50, 70 and 90 during 2001–2011 in the river Quito. In river Atrato 976, 706 and 500 m3/s have occurred (in %) 50, 75 and 90 during 1984–2015. Suspended sediment concentrations were measured using a linear equation derived from the results obtained from laboratory analysis of field samples and acoustic doppler current profiler. Minimum and maximum flow discharge (Q) observed using ADCP instrument was 0.59 m3/s at the tributary and 370 m3/s at the downstream of main river indicating that the tributaries play an important role in sediment supply. Spatially distinct trends in suspended sediment load, with an increasing trend from the upstream (73.73 tons/day) to downstream (3140.82 tons/day) in the main channel is observed. Significant correlation (r 2 = 0.79 and 0.85 for tributary and main river, respectively) between the SSL and Q suggests that the SSL depends on the intensity of runoff, governed by the extreme rainfall condition. In contrast, no significant correlation was observed between Q and SSC due to the continuous migration of mining dredges and dumping of mine tailing piles at the riverbank.

This paper first presents a method for measuring water footprint by sector based on the non-competitive input-output technique. Second, this research explores the relationship between water price adjustment and labor compensation, as well as regional water export. Accordingly, this paper constructs a mathematical planning model for differentiated water price adjustment by sector with the objectives of minimum water exports and maximum labor rewards, and conducts a simulation study in the water-scarce Henan Province. The study's findings suggest that: (1) In contrast to direct water use, water consumption in Henan Province is more balanced in terms of water footprint, with the food and tobacco processing industry replacing agriculture as the leading water consumption sector. (2) Sectoral differentiated pricing saves 6.9% more export water resources in Henan Province than uniform sector-wide pricing with the same export GDP loss.

To further understand the intrinsic molecular biological mechanism of Feammox with NDFO and improve the total nitrogen (TN) removal efficiency of the culture system, functional gene endogenous development and exogenous factors affecting nitrogen removal driven by the iron-nitrogen cycle were analyzed. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that the three different ecological groups all formed a similar stable iron-nitrogen bacteria community structure. For 16S rRNA and qPCR, the dominant bacterial genera of Feammox coupled with NDFO were closely related, the amount of nxrB, nirS, and nosZ gene are 1-2 orders of magnitude larger than the amoA, narG, and AMX gene, which are the most important endogenous factors affecting nitrogen removal in the system. And an interesting result is that amoA, nxrB, narG, nirS and nosZ genes were all significantly positively correlated with each other (p < 0.05), indicating that the nitrogen cycle function genes changed synchronously, which was consistent with the changes in the microbial genera. The experimental process was optimized by changing environmental factors such as pH, organic carbon and extracellular electron shuttle to improve nitrogen removal. The results indicated that TN removal efficiency (67.05–76.12%) was greatly increased compared with the previous experiments (18.62–19.38%), which was the highest in pH = 8 groups (COD/TN = 3) because pH of the enrichment system stabilized to approximately 8. Moreover, the added 9,10-anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS) has improved TN removal efficiency to 67.27–87.75% through its extracellular electron transfer function, which was higher than that of control groups (without AQDS).

A digital twin is one in which data flows automatically and in both directions between a physical object and a virtual object. Withing this context, this paper presents a digital twin of a smart irrigation system in an application scenario. A digital twin for an irrigation system is one in which the physical components of the system, such as its sensors and actuators, are connected with their virtual representations. The system is composed of a FIWARE-based internet of things platform and a discrete event simulation model in Siemens Plant Simulation software. The internet of things platform is used to collect, aggregate and process soil, weather and crop data to calculate daily irrigation prescriptions. The simulation model is used to simulate the behavior of an irrigation system defined in an application scenario. The communication between the platform and the simulation model happens in real-time and is intermediate by an OPC UA server. A application scenario is considered to evaluate the behavior of the system and to evaluate, in future research, different irrigation strategies. The benefits of the systems proposed are twofold. First, evaluate the behavior of the Internet of Things (IoT) platform and an irrigation system before implementing both in the field. Second, enable the evaluation of different irrigation strategies in parallel with current farm practices.

To simplify the wastewater treatment process, this work explored the fundamental problems of removing residual sodium oleate (NaOl) from tailings wastewater by one step starting from tailings pulp treatment. The removal behavior and mechanism of NaOl from wastewater by metal ions combined with gangue minerals in the tailings pulp were studied.

Moreover, metal ions and gangue minerals played a synergistic role in enhancing the COD removal of NaOl colloid. Mechanism analysis showed that the unit charge solubility of FeOl3 or AlOl3 was much lower than that of CaOl2, so Fe3+ or Al3+ was more likely to precipitate with NaOl than Ca2+. The addition of Fe3+ or Al3+ to NaOl colloid reduced the absolute value of the zeta potential of the suspended solids under suitable pH conditions, leading to colloid condensation. When metal ions and gangue minerals coexisted, gangue minerals adsorbed part of NaOl and played the role of coarse particles carrying fine particles to settle. This finding can be used to explain the synergistic effect of metal ions and gangue minerals. The study provides a new idea for the treatment of MPW and has great application prospect.

In the context of China's rapid economic development, how to achieve the sustainable development of water resources, social economy and ecological environment has become an urgent issue. Water Resources Carrying Capacity (WRCC) is an important indicator of the degree of coordinated social, economic and ecological development that can be supported by water resources in a certain region. Based on the internal mechanism of WRCC, this paper constructs the evaluation system of WRCC, and estimates WRCC of 9 provinces in the Yellow River Basin (YRB) from 2009 to 2018 by the entropy method. Using the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model, we analyze the driving effects of WRCC differences in the YRB from both spatial and temporal aspects. Main conclusions are as follows: (1) There is an inherent mechanism between water resources, social economy and eco-environment, and the coordinated development of the three subsystems can promote the improvement of WRCC; (2) From 2009 to 2018, WRCC of the YRB showed a relatively stable upward trend, in which the sewage treatment effect and the technical effect were the main factors promoting WRCC, while the economic effect had a negative weakening function throughout the research period; (3) There were obvious differences in the WRCC of each province. We choose Shandong and Gansu as the comparison objects, then analyze the factors causing differences of WRCC through the driving effects decomposition analysis.

Floating litter cleaning up solution, as an essential strategy for reducing pollution, is formulated in a few studies. In autonomous waste collection systems like unmanned surface vehicles (USV), floating litter cleaning up is very challenging on natural water surfaces due to the complex environmental factors seriously degrading litter detection accuracy, lowering efficiency, or even causing the failure of collection. The impact of the cleaning-up solution on environmental recovery has yet to be discussed. To fill knowledge gaps, we propose an accurate and adaptable deep learning solution based on Faster RCNN to address this challenge through the first-time implementation of the attention mechanism at the C3 stage of ResNet50 to effectively extract the useful feature information and compress the negative influence of the complex environmental factors. We here first discuss the effectiveness of our cleaning-up solution in water pollution-reducing and waste recycling for resource-saving, to the best of our knowledge. The extensive experimental results on our self-built dataset show that our solution is superior to the state of the arts in the accuracy and adaptability of floating litter detection under the different complex scenes. Our solution improves the effectiveness of floating waste collection a lot. It significantly contributes to pollution mitigation, ecosystem, resource-saving, and human health. It is suggested that stakeholders should pay more attention to improving cleaning-up solutions. This work strives to shed light on it based on deep learning for environmental recovery and sustainability.

To improve the utilization rate of flood resources of hydropower reservoirs, taking the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) as an example, an optimal forecast dispatching model for flood resources utilization (FRU) in flood season is established first based on the safety requirements of flood control, combining the power demand and the safe operating conditions of the power grid. Then, considering the uncertainty of runoff forecast, the stochastic simulation method of inflow forecast based on the gaussian mixture model (GMM) is used to assess the flood control risk of FRU dispatching. Finally, the optimal dispatching rules of TGR in flood season considering FRU are derived by using the gradient boosting regression tree (GRBT). The experimental results show that the optimal dispatching rules can effectively improve the utilization rate of flood resources and increase the generation benefit of TGR during flood season without an additional increase in flood control risk. Compared with routine dispatching, the hydropower generation of the TGR by rule dispatching considering inflow forecast information of 3, 5, and 7 days can be increased by 3.38%, 5.57%, and 6.93% respectively. This shows that the dispatching rules derived are very reliable and promising, which can provide decision support for reservoirs operation in flood season.

Sludge treatment includes an anaerobic digestion step where bioaugmentation can be performed to concurrently boost biogas/methane production while degrading microplastics. This article aims to provide a perspective on the bioaugmentation of anaerobic sludge digestion to enhance microplastics removal based on the current available studies on microplastics-degrading anaerobes and bioaugmentation of anaerobic sludge digesters for improved methane and biogas production. It also examines the very limited existing work on bioaugmentation of anaerobic sludge digestion to remove microplastics. Numerous anaerobes such as Holomonas and Cloacamonales have been identified to have microplastics-degrading ability. In view of the complexity of sludge anaerobic digestion, this perspective article highlights the potential of Clostridium sp. which is involved in acetogenesis and has been successfully genetically engineered for microplastics biodegradation as a feasible candidate for bioaugmentation. It is of the opinion that microbial consortia derived from sludge or wastewater treatment plants offer the benefits of improving anaerobic digestion and degradation of a wider range of microplastics, especially after genetic engineering and acclimatization with volatile fatty acids and microplastics degradation. It also deems that bioaugmentation is cost-effective and could be integrated with the existing sludge treatment process though bioaugmentation of anaerobic sludge digestion is limited by the lack of pilot- and full-scale studies to enable better evaluation of its feasibility. A certain reliance on recombinant anaerobes may pose unknown risks upon their entry into the environment.

After electronics obsolescence, BFRs are gradually released and enriched in the environment, thus leading to frequent occurrence and detection. However, the environmental fate of multiple flame retardants in aquatic microcosms has not been explored, and it mainly focused on the environmental monitoring of BFRs and the toxicity of a single BFR to aquatic organisms. To fill the gap, based on actual investigation, a water-sediment-zebrafish microcosm system was co-exposed to five concentrations (0.2, 1, 5, 25, and 50 mg/kg) of pentabromotoluene (PBT), hexabromobenzene (HBB), 1,2-bis(2,4,6-tribromophenoxy) ethane (BTBPE), decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), and decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-209) for the enrichment (35 days) and clearance (10 days) experiments. The results showed that the liver, intestine, and gill were the top three tissues enriched in BFRs, which were 7504.54, 6936.99, and 3532.97 ng/g, respectively. BFRs can also be transferred between a generation. The compositions of BFRs in the tissues of zebrafish were also different, and the average compositions of DBDPE and BDE-209 were 36.2% and 28.6%, respectively, indicating that DBDPE and BDE-209 were more easily absorbed by zebrafish. Additionally, the average scavenging half-lives of PBT, HBB, BTBPE, DBDPE, and BDE209 were 4.01, 4.09, 2.90, 3.72, and 3.75 days, respectively, suggesting that these chemicals barely lasted long in zebrafish. The metabolic pathways of the five BFRs were also probed, and gradual debromination occurred in the organisms.

Studies have reported the toxicity of combined pollutants on the performance and microbial community in sequencing batch reactors. However, the influence of combined pollutants on nitrogen removal in wetlands remains unclear. Here, an 84 d exposure experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of cadmium (Cd) and doxycycline (DC) on nitrogen metabolism in ecological ditches using metagenomic analysis. The results showed that adding 50 mg L−1 DC at 5 mg L−1 Cd stress deteriorated nitrogen removal performance and significantly increased N2O emissions and lactate dehydrogenase release. However, a low level of Cd (0.5 mg L−1) significantly reduced N2O emissions under the high DC concentration pressure (50 mg L−1). The increasing Cd concentration markedly weakened the inhibition of DC (1 mg L−1) on the relative abundances of the dominant genera. Moreover, high concentrations of mixed Cd/DC showed stronger inhibitory effects on glucokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase. NADH had a higher tolerance to mixed Cd/DC than ATP. However, low levels of mixed Cd/DC led to a higher abundance of key denitrifying enzymes and genes. The assimilatory nitrate reduction pathway increased under the mixture of Cd/DC stress, accompanied by an increase in ferredoxin-nitrite/nitrate reductase and the abundance of nasA and nirA genes. Our results indicate that the presence of low-level Cd could alleviate the impact of DC on nitrogen removal and N2O emissions in ecological ditches by altering microbial community and enzymatic activity associated with transport, metabolism, and gene expression. However, the increasing Cd concentration at DC stress could intensify the combined toxicity. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the ecological toxicity of emerging combined pollutants and their impact on biological nitrogen transformation in wastewater treatment systems.

The study was developed in the green belt of the peri-urban region of the city of São Paulo, located at the edge of the Atlantic Forest, a high-biodiversity forest in the south-eastern Brazil. The simulation of this complex system aims to support the sustainable governance policy of conventional and agroecological production systems.

The phytoplankton that causes blooms is affected by environmental conditions including light-heat, water quality and hydrodynamics. Exploring the environmental coupling effects (including hydrodynamic effects) of phytoplankton is critical for reservoir management, but such studies are still scarce. This study monitored the phytoplankton and environmental factor data of Zipingpu Reservoir for 29 months and constructed a novel partial least squares structural equation modeling to quantify the impacts of environmental conditions on the phytoplankton in the canyon-shaped reservoir. There were significant spatial differences in the biomass of phytoplankton in the reservoir, and the biomass reached its peak in May to July every year. The model explained 51.4% of the spatiotemporal variation in phytoplankton and revealed that the coupling effect of flow and nutrition affected the transparency (with a coefficient of −0.427, p < 0.01) and then influence the biomass of phytoplankton. The coupling effect of flow and meteorology indirectly modified phytoplankton biomass by changing physicochemical properties (with a coefficient of 0.261, p < 0.01). Meteorology indirectly affected stratification by changing the physicochemical properties of the water and promoted temporal variation in phytoplankton biomass. The contribution rates of hydrodynamic conditions, including operation, flow and stratification variables, to phytoplankton dynamics were extremely high, reaching 34.9%. The flow change caused by reservoir operation will significantly affect phytoplankton (with a coefficient of 0.352, p < 0.01), especially when the temperature is appropriate, and a hydrodynamic operation strategy aiming to avoid rapid increases in the water level (more than 0.8 m d−1) in the reservoir may be effective in restraining blooms.

Based on electricity generation profiles pertinent to variation of design variables of solar multiple and thermal energy storage, the water usage is quantified techno-economically, considering water scarcity levels. Besides, five different potential impacts over lifecycle of concentrated solar and natural gas-based power plants are compared after unifying them into metric of net environmental impact avoided. Additionally, utilizing techno-economic solutions and eco-friendly solutions, multi-objective ‘balanced’ solution is proposed. It is found that levelized cost of water increases five-fold for areas with extreme water scarcity and is higher for trough than solar tower. Net environmental impact of troughs is higher and lower electricity generation causes the avoided impact to be higher than solar towers, when compared with natural gas-fired power plants. For eco-friendly solutions, solar multiple varies from 3.5 to 4 with thermal energy storage of 24 h. Dry-cooled solar towers with optimal solar multiple in range of 3–3.2 and thermal energy storage of 18.8–19.9 h are evaluated for pareto-optimality based ‘balanced’ solutions for all zones.

In this study, the spatiotemporal distributions of organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (including geochemical speciation), δ13C and nutrient ratios in sediments were explored to interpret changes in the aquatic environment of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE), and their sources in various periods were identified. Nutrients carried by surface runoff accumulated abundantly in the sediments of the northern and western shoals. Two dated sediment cores indicated a close relationship between environmental evolution in the PRE and the socioeconomic development of the Pearl River Delta (PRD). Rapid urbanization and population explosion in the PRD transformed the PRE from the pre-1970 low-impact state to a eutrophic state, which lasted until the end of the 1990s.

However, they are unsuitable to simulate characteristics and distributions of NPS pollution over semiarid agricultural watersheds of intensive irrigation, infrequent precipitation, and shallow groundwater. In this study, field monitoring was conducted to identify key impact factors of total nitrogen (TN) loads from NPS pollution over a typical semiarid agricultural watershed in northern China. Sources and characteristics of TN loads were examined by integrating the monitoring, a Pearson correlation analysis, an agro-hydrologic model, and a genetic algorithm into an ECM framework. This study quantitatively revealed the relationship between agro-hydrologic features and NPS nitrogen pollution in semiarid agricultural areas; it also simplified quantification of nutrient distributions in various seasons under pollution-source diversity. An accurate ECM was constructed to simulate variation of TN loads with seasons. Compared with traditional ones, the developed model reduces the simulation error of TN loads from 16.2% to 8.9% and improves R2 from 0.072 to 0.692. Simulation results show that the dominant TN nutrient source, i.e., farmland, accounts for 49% of annual TN loads. If water use efficiency increases from 40% to 50%, the largest reduction of TN loads would occur on farmland (about 14.4%), followed by grassland (12.0%), construction land (11.5%), bare land (11.0%), and woodland (8.3%).

We used daily precipitation and temperature data from two General Circulation Models (GCM), HadGEM2-ES and MIROC5 with moderate (+4.5 W/m2 in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial levels) and severe (+8.5 W/m2) radiative forcing from carbon dioxide emissions in the atmosphere (Representative Concentration Pathways).

Each LULCC period was coupled with the highest impact climate scenario found for TAW (MIROC5-RCP 8.5); thus, we investigated five scenarios and their impacts on hydropower production and revenue in THP. Our results highlight that the TAW will face a large water reduction by the end of the century, which in all scenarios will strongly impact the basin's energy production and hydro revenue. Reductions of up to 74% in annual flow and 63% in electricity generation are expected for the most pessimistic scenario (L8.5), triggering a 135% deficit per year in THP revenue. Although some land use change scenarios partially minimize the climate-driven flow decrease trend in the period of higher precipitation, there is still a dramatic reduction in flow during the dry season, thus exacerbating seasonal and inter-annual variability.

In this study, different initial moisture contents (W1, W2, W3), different straw and biochar applications (S1, S2, B1, B2) and untreated control groups CK were used. A laboratory simulation was designed, and the changes in total soil porosity (TP), pore distribution, soil aggregates, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and soil thermal conductivity (λ) were analyzed. The results showed that freeze–thaw cycles affected soil porosity and destroyed soil aggregates, while straw and biochar applications increased total soil porosity, enhanced pore connectivity, and enhanced soil aggregate stability. Freeze–thaw cycles and straw and biochar applications increased soil Ksat, and biochar showed a stronger ability to improve soil hydraulic conductivity. After 20 freeze–thaw cycles, compared with the control group, the Ksat of treatments S1 and B1 increased on average by 11.18% and 22.03%, respectively, at different moisture contents, while the Ksat of treatments S2 and B2 decreased on average by 3.65% and 6.17%, respectively. Excessive application of the amendments reduced the soil Ksat. During the freeze–thaw cycles, the soil λ of each treatment first showed a stable trend and then decreased. However, the increase in the initial moisture content induced a significant increase in soil λ. Straw and biochar applications reduced soil λ, and the reduction was proportional to the applied amount, but the thermal insulation effect of biochar was better than that of straw. This study showed that the comprehensive effect of the B1 treatment was better than that of the other treatments for improving the soil structure, and enhancing the soil infiltration capacity and enhancing soil thermal insulation capacity. A 1% biochar application is recommended as the optimal soil amendment. ";"2023-01-20";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622053616";"17";"Water Other"

A reasonable compensation interval (the value range of the compensation standard) is the basis for final pricing. At present, the calculation method of the compensation interval has not been unified in the current research, and it is rarely considered comprehensively from the perspective of both parties of compensation. Based on the perspectives of upstream water resources suppliers and downstream water resources consumers, this paper proposes a water ecological compensation interval accounting method based on emergy analysis theory and water ecological footprint method. From the perspective of the supply side, the remaining ecological economic system services value supplied by the upstream area is taken as the lower limit; from the perspective of the consumer side, the value of ecological economic system services actually occupied by downstream areas is taken as the upper limit. Taking the Qingyi River Basin as an example, the results show that there is a serious ecological deficit in the lower reaches of the Qingyi River Basin, and reasonable compensation needs to be given to the supplier Xinzheng City; the accounting method based on dual perspectives is better than traditional. The method is more precise and greatly shortens the value range of the compensation standard. This study provides a novel and complete ecological compensation interval accounting method, which provides a more accurate and reasonable reference for the determination of ecological compensation standards in the basin, and helps the government to improve and implement the ecological compensation mechanism.

Many optimization approaches have been developed for shale gas water management; however, most of the studies assumed permanent utilization of wastewater treatment facilities with fixed capacities. Considering the rapidly declining characteristics of shale gas wastewater production, these treatment facilities could remain largely underutilized after the first few months/years of production, making them less economically attractive. To maximize the capacity utilization of treatment facilities and further improve the economic performance of shale gas development, this study develops a systematic optimization framework, where the capacity strategy of conventional treatment facilities and utilization of the recent concept of modular manufacturing are both considered for flexible shale gas water management. The proposed mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model simultaneously optimizes the design and planning of integrated shale gas and water supply chain, with a focus on capacity planning for both large-scale conventional treatment facilities and small-scale modular devices. A series of Marcellus-based case studies are performed to illustrate the applicability of the proposed model and provide general insights into the trade-offs between the multiple types of treatment facilities. The optimization results reveal that the combinatorial utilization of conventional facilities and modular devices for wastewater treatment (66% by conventional facilities and 34% by modular devices) brings 9.3% more reused water for other well development and 6.2% savings in water-related costs, compared to flexible management of only conventional facilities. This work suggests that taking modular device as auxiliary equipment for shale gas water management is most beneficial to increase the capacity utilization of treatment facilities and achieve a more economic and sustainable shale gas production system.

Therefore, we require reconsideration of the way we use freshwater in livestock feed production. The objective of this study is to assess the impact on freshwater use of pork production by using alternative pig diets based on local feed ingredients, or by-products. We used a lifecycle approach to analyse the freshwater use associated with feed production to produce one kg of pork. We explored three feeding scenarios (STANDARD: diets commercially used in Ireland; LOCAL: diets based on ingredients grown in Ireland; and BY-PRODUCT: diets based on by-products only). We calculated the freshwater use, using the water footprint (WFP) method, and the competition for water use between food and feed production using the water use ratio (WUR) for each scenario. The WUR quantifies the maximum amount of human digestible protein (HDP) derived from food crops that could be produced on the same land, and using the same water resources, that were used to grow the feed ingredients needed to produce 1 kg of pork. The WFP of the scenarios was 2,470 L/kg pork for STANDARD, 2,492 L/kg pork for LOCAL, and 2,205 L/kg pork for BY-PRODUCT. When we considered the WUR, none of the scenarios had a value < 1 (i.e. in all scenarios, more HDP can be produced from direct cultivation of food crops rather than pork). However, the BY-PRODUCT scenario (1.4) performed better than STANDARD (1.9) and LOCAL (2.9). Beet pulp and bakery by-products had zero WFP and no edibility and were thus considered promising ingredients. Moreover, rapeseed meal had a low WFP and rapeseed meal and sunflower seed meal are not considered human edible and were considered fit for future inclusion in diets. We also concluded that both the WFP and WUR methods have separate strengths and limitations, and should thus be used in conjunction; the ideal diet is one with the minimum WFP and WUR. Consideration of human edibility of feed ingredients is an important approach which should be included in future studies. Moreover, the entire food system including dairy, beef, poultry and other competitive uses should be taken into account when considering which feed ingredients to use in pig diets.";"2023-01-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622050624";"1";"Water Other"

However, different ecological engineering governance measures can lead to different changes in land use, resulting in corresponding changes to ESs and ecosystem service value (ESV), yet these changes is the content that needs to be clarified. In this study, four kinds of ESs, namely water yield, soil conservation, carbon storage and water purification, were quantified in part region of the Beijing-Tianjin Sandstorm Source Control Project (BTSSCP). In addition, eight scenarios were simulated according to the land use change caused by engineering management measures, and the ESs and ESV ensuing under these differing scenarios quantified accordingly. The results show that the main land use types in the study area from 2000 to 2020 were cropland and forestland, while during this period land use change mainly consisted of the expansion of grassland (+466.79 km2) and loss of cropland (−2095.27 km2). For different engineering management measures, protective governance will play a greater role in improving ESs than restoration governance. Protecting the existing governance outcomes from degrading can maintain a water yield of 36.85 × 108 m3, soil conservation of 73.72 × 106 t, carbon storage of 89.01 × 106 t, the purified water nitrogen content of 1.21 × 106 t, with the total ESV maintained at 54.237 billion yuan. Moreover, the high-investment counties clearly engage in ecological restoration that provides high ESV. Yet, there are still some counties with high project investment where the gains in ESV are low, such as Luanping county and Pingquan county. Therefore, it should be reasonably distributed based on the existing governance results in the next round of project investment allocation. In the past 20 years, engineering governance measures have significantly improved the ESs in the region. Nevertheless, looking ahead, it remains necessary to strengthen the emphasis on protecting governance outcomes.

Here we quantified six key ESs dynamics, explored the relationships between paired ESs using Pearson correlation coefficient, identified the TOS bundles using K-means cluster analysis, and investigated the social-ecological drivers by redundancy analysis (RDA). We found that: (1) from 1995 to 2015, the ESs of food production and livestock supply increased, despite half kinds of ESs decreased. Soil conservation service remained basically unchanged; (2) the synergistic relationships were always more pronounced than the trade-off relationships on the two study scales (Tibet and county).

In the modern world, where synthetic fibers made from petroleum derivatives dominate the textile sector, it is evident that plastic wastes at macro, micro, and nano scales put the health of all living things at risk. The release of microplastics into the environment is significantly affected, especially from wastewater treatment plants. The primary goal of this study is to identify the most effective pretreatment approach for reducing organic matters in textile wastewater to in order to better detect microplastics and microfibers.

The outcomes revealed that H2O2 was the most efficient chemical for separating organic from textile wastewater, while KOH and NaOH resulted in physical and chemical damages for all polymer types. Although it was noted that HCl and Fenton's reagent did not affect other microfibers, they had been found to alter the physical structure of polyamide, making it more challenging to extract from wastewater.

Crop redistribution is a practical solution to the sustainable intensification of agricultural systems by replacing existing crops with more suitable ones. Here we test this redistribution theory and its impacts on species diversity using six decades of data on the annual world production of 137 food crop products and their average water footprint (WFP). We find the global food crop effective species diversity had an increasing trend from 21 to 27 in recent six decades. Then, we develop a nutrient water footprint productivity index (WFPPI) to optimize crop distribution. Large calorie (+14%), mineral (+25%), and vitamin (+26%) production increases are possible from reshaping the global distribution of 100 crops within the current total WFP and area harvested. Wheat and paddy rice area can reduce by 31% and 34%, respectively, while increasing maize and soybean area by 18% and 40%, respectively. The global redistribution could feed an additional 866 million people while supplying 37% more than the caloric demand for the projected biofuel growth between 2020 and 2030 in the Net Zero Scenario. Such an optimization process does not entail a loss of crop species diversity. With a change of no more than 5%, the stability of the total area harvested for the four largest crops (wheat, maize, paddy rice, and soybeans) is critical for both production and species diversity of all crops.

Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K s ) is one of the important parameters to characterize soil infiltration capacity. The soil compaction in the mining area significantly affects soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, and its field measurement is very difficult due to the severe soil compaction. Precise prediction of soil saturated hydraulic conductivity is a prerequisite for understanding water movement and solute transport processes. In this study, soil samples taken from the dump site of the Antaibao open-pit coal mine in the Pingshuo mining area of China were prepared in laboratory according to different bulk densities (1.25, 1.3, 1.35, 1.4, 1.45, 1.5, 1.55, 1.6, 1.65, 1.7, 1.75, and 1.8 g cm−3), and the soil saturated water conductivity was measured in laboratory using constant head method.

The number of macropores and macroporosity decreased with the increase in the bulk density, and the soil compaction resulted in poor connectivity of the soil macropores. The trend of the soil saturated water conductivity predicted using the CT scanning technique was consistent with that of the measured values in the laboratory under different bulk densities. With the increase of bulk density, the difference between the predicted value and the measured value increased slightly. Overall, a good prediction effect was achieved (R2 > 0.84).

The current study primarily examines the most sustainable approach for treating textile dye-bath effluents through combined physical and advanced oxidation technologies, providing a comprehensive literature survey about treatment techniques. First, it explores the physical treatment processes with electrocoagulation, dissolved air flotation, lamella clarifier, and reverse osmosis stages. Secondly, the advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as ozonation, direct photolysis (UV), UV/H2O2, UV/H2O2/O3, Fenton, and photo-Fenton system are also individually discussed, which showed significant results in the treatment efficiency. Particularly, the integrated electrocoagulation process and AOPs are also ameliorated, which achieved the best eco-friendly treatment, time-effective, and reduce area footprint provided by numerous studies. The AOPs are required for almost 30 min for the treatment, whereas the biological treatment takes 24–72 h, which resultantly minimizes 25 times area footprint, minimum electricity consumption, and high removal efficiency. Lastly, cost estimation and policy formulation of the effluent treatment plants at the national level are also demonstrated to prevent the toxicity of treatment practices in textile industries.

To better understand how the drug affected anaerobic digestion, model tests were conducted on four stages of hydrolysis, acidification, acetogenesis and methanogenesis. The model tests indicated that such drug could promote the solubilization of inoculum, thereby releasing polysaccharides and proteins. But the hydrolysis stage, commonly recognized as the rate-limiting step was restricted. Meanwhile, the enhanced acidification contributed to the accumulation of volatile fatty acids. Both acetogenesis and methanogenesis were severely disturbed eventually causing a significant decrease in methane yield. The level of interference of carbamazepine on anaerobic digestion was concluded as follows: acetogenesis > methanogenesis > hydrolysis > acidification > solubilization. The high-throughput sequencing revealed the abundance of Chloroflexi increased from 21.5% to 26.7% as a main responsibility for the volatile acid accumulation. The acetoclastic methanogen Methanosaeta decreased from 59.86% to 44.78%, while the hydrogenotrophic methanogens Methanobacterium and Methanomassiliicoccus increased from 28%, 0.5%–37.9% and 4.1%, respectively. Although the recovery of methane was limited for clean production, it was more recommendable to recover the volatile fatty acids from organic wastewater or sludge with high dosage of carbamazepine.

Therefore, this work focused on finding the most suitable soil-water conservation areas at a micro-scale using coupling coordination mechanism. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to create a priority model for sub-watershed basin based on nineteen morphometric parameters. We then quantified the soil erosion using the revised universal soil loss equation (RUSLE) for current and future scenarios based on the representative concentration pathway (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5 models (RCP2.6 and 8.5). In addition, we proposed the fuzzy logic and analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model-based soil-water conservation suitability (SWPC) model for current and future scenarios. Finally, the most suitable soil-water conservation areas for current and future scenarios were identified using coupling coordination degree model (CCD). To the author's knowledge, this is the first in-depth study that identifies the most suitable conservation areas by analyzing the watershed prioritization, soil erosion, and topographic, hydrologic, land cover, and climatic parameters-based soil-water conservation suitability models. Sub-watersheds comprising Silsako, Bharalu, Deepor Beel, and North Guwahati have been identified as high-priority sub-watersheds. According to the current RUSLE model, soil erosion in the study area varies from 140 to 181.64 tonnes per hectare per year. In contrast, soil erosion would continue to increase in the future as per the RCP8.5 model, which varies from 305 to 332 tonnes per hectare per year. The current SWPC model predicted 46.92 km2 area as high and 54.40 km2 area as very high suitable zones. However, under the RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5 models, the high and very high SWPC zones will experience extended areas in the future due to increased soil erosion intensity. According to the CCDM results, Bharalu, Deepor Beel, and North-Guwahati sub-watersheds have observed a very high to medium coupling degrees, which are considered the most suitable areas for conservation. The findings of this study will significantly help stakeholders and experts in long-term land-water resource management and effectively address environmental degradation issues in urban watersheds around the world.

In this study, we examined nitrogen loads in stormwater and snowmelt runoff from four urban catchments of a major, cold-region North American city over the past 31 years (1991–2021). Temporal variability of total organic nitrogen (TON), nitrate and nitrite nitrogen (NOx-N), total ammonia nitrogen (TAN), and total nitrogen (TN) were similar in the four catchments, which had an increasing trend from 1992 (TN: 1.3–3.4 kg/ha/year) to 2006–2011 (TN: 5.5–19.3 kg/ha/year) and a decreasing trend afterward. Trends and change points in the four urban catchments were influenced by storm/snowmelt events, land use, urban drainage infrastructure issues, and stormwater management facilities. The maximum monthly fluctuation occurred in March/April and July due to high variations of snowmelt and storm events. The ratios of monthly loads during the storm season (April to October) to the snow season (November to March) for TON, NOx-N, and TN were 1.31, 1.12, and 1.15, respectively; whereas it was 0.95 for TAN. TKN, TAN, and TN event mean concentrations (EMCs) in snowmelt were higher (18.0%, 94.0%, and 10.8%, respectively) than those in stormwater. However, the NOx-N EMC in snowmelt was lower (9.3%) than in stormwater. ";"2023-01-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S095965262204985X";"4";"Water Other"

In addition, the influence of water injection parameters on cooling effect of roadway and heat recovery performance of the SMGE system is investigated. The results indicate that the temperature of surrounding rock is cooled gradually during the water injection and heat recovery in rock formation, which reduces the temperature increase rate of airflow in the roadway. When the injection water temperature is reduced from 28 °C to 11.5 °C, the cooling rate of roadway can be observable increased, but it results in a faster temperature decrease in production water with time.

However, the economic unfeasibility of HRGs has hindered their implementation. Methods to improve the economic benefits of HRGs have rarely been explored. This study proposes a comprehensive economic analysis based on the cooperative theory to explore the economic potential of HRGs. An HRG on campus in Japan was selected as a case study to evaluate its water-saving performance. The economic feasibility of the HRG was then analyzed based on the life cycle cost model. Finally, considering that the implementation of the HRG weakened the profit of the main water plants, the cooperative feasibility and driving factors between the HRG and main water plants were explored in terms of mutual benefits based on the cooperative theory. The results highlight that the construction costs significantly reduce the economic benefits of HRGs. HRGs have more substantial economic benefits in cooperation than in non-cooperation. In addition, the subsidy of the government for HRGs makes it easier to drive the success of the cooperation.

Wetland species and their habitat protection is an important embodiment of wetland system protection. Simultaneously, the importance of recreation as a form of human activity within wetlands should not be underestimated. Wetland parks, as a mode of rational wetland use, provide the public opportunities for leisure and entertainment, exemplifying China's commitment to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands. However, With the acceleration of urbanization, the degree of fragmentation of the wetland system is increasing. The wetland park and its surrounding landscape elements are separated from each other, resulting in the phenomenon of islanding, which is not conducive to the protection and utilization of wetland biodiversity. This study focuses on Yancheng coastal wetland, a UNESCO World Heritage site in Jiangsu, China, as its research area. It integrates habitat birds, a core component of wetland biodiversity, into the development framework of wetland parks. The study proposes the use of composite habitat corridors to connect fragmented bird habitats with public recreational areas, establishing a collaborative wetland park system. The methodology involved three key steps: (1)Spatial Modeling. Utilizing Maxent, the spatial distribution of birds and public recreation areas was modeled, and suitable patches for both were extracted. (2) Corridor Identification. Linkage Mapper was employed to identify bird and recreational corridors, while the MCR model was used to pinpoint composite habitat corridors. (3) Network Development. Corridors generated in the previous step were superimposed on the ArcGIS platform to create a network of interconnected bird habitats and public recreation areas within the wetland park system. The study's results demonstrate: (1) There are obvious spatial distribution differences between the current core bird habitat and public recreation areas in Yancheng coastal wetland. (2) The establishment of a composite corridor network realizes the interconnection between bird habitats and public recreation areas，among them, the corridor network in the southern region is short and dense, with higher stability. (3) The areas passed by the composite corridor network are mainly productive landscapes such as cultivated land and aquaculture ponds, and therefore, certain protection and restoration measures should be taken to create suitable habitat conditions for birds and humans. This study provides a novel model for wetland protection and sustainable utilization, particularly relevant to many developing countries facing similar challenges.

A novel hybrid composite of TiO2/iron tailings (TITs) was synthesized in this study via a facile method as a photocatalyst for the degradation of doxycycline hydrochloride (DOX). The design beneficially enhances the light absorption capacity because the TITs composite photocatalyst has a narrower band gap (2.77 eV), larger light absorption edge (448 nm), and restrains recombination of photogenerated e−/h+, which is attributed to the TITs composite photocatalyst having a lower photoluminescence (PL) strength, a higher transient photo-current response, and a smaller Nyquist plot radius, as compared with pure TiO2. The DOX removal efficiency by TITs during photocatalytic degradation was 98.37% within 120 min under a Xe lamp and 76.73% within 180 min under sunlight, which were 1.23- and 1.46-fold higher than that of pure TiO2, respectively.

In this study, we have synthesized a ternary nanocomposite (PANI/BiOCl/GO) through an oxidative polymerization approach, incorporating polyaniline (PANI), graphene oxide (GO), and bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl). Different weight percentages of composites (GO/BiOCl: 0.5%, 1%, 2.5%, and PANI: 99.5%, 99%, 97.5%) were prepared and named as 0.5PBG, 1PBG, and 2.5PBG, respectively. The ternary nanocomposite's successful development, crystallinity, purity, porosity, and optical properties were evaluated through several spectroscopic and surface analysis techniques, including UV–Vis-DRS, PL, XRD, XPS, BET, and EDS analysis. FESEM and HRTEM images unveiled the porous characteristics of PANI, the morphology of exfoliated GO layers, and the nanoplate-like structure of BiOCl. The ternary nanocomposite was finally tested for its ability to degrade an organic dye, rhodamine-b (Rhb), and in the process also generate solar-light-driven green hydrogen by water half-splitting. The composite achieved about 90% detoxification (assigned from GC-TCD by analyzing the evolved CO2 gas after degradation) and 96% color removal of Rhb dye within 120 min. The degradation of Rhb by 1PBG displayed a first-order reaction, featuring a rate constant 7.25 times higher than that observed for pure PANI, 3.8 times higher than for pure GO, and 3.9 times higher than for pure BiOCl. Thus, the ternary composites achieve a good amount of synergy. Significantly, this reaction rate constant is 4.7 times greater than the rate observed with commercially used TiO2–P25 photocatalyst. Various reaction parameters including solution pH, different illumination areas, catalyst dosage, and the study of scavengers were investigated to understand their effects on the degradation reaction. The photocatalyst's reusability effectiveness was evaluated over 6 cycles, and its stability was subsequently confirmed through XRD and ICP-OES analysis. The LC-MS study revealed the identification of various intermediates and end products following the degradation reaction. The nanocomposite also produced 1000 ppm of hydrogen gas with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 17.97% when CH3OH was used as a sacrificial agent, 500 ppm (AQE of 9.69%) in the acidic conditions, and 600 ppm (AQE of 11.63%) in the basic conditions. In a broader perspective, this endeavor paves the way for exploring fresh opportunities in the utilization of this ternary nanocomposite. Its potential extends beyond accelerating dye degradation to encompass diverse solar-driven applications as well.

Despite considerable efforts, the establishment of a reliable and highly efficient system for hydrogen generation powered by visible light remains challenging. In this study, we developed a solar-active strontium niobate-doped titanium oxide incorporated with graphene (Sr2Nb2O7–rGO–TiO2), characterized by various analytical techniques such as optical, morphological, HR-TEM, XPS, and XRD. Sr2Nb2O7–rGO–TiO2 demonstrated enhanced photocatalytic H2 evolution under solar irradiation without requiring precious-metal doping. The maximum H2 production performance rate of 1769 μmol/g/h was attained with the Sr2Nb2O7–rGO–TiO2 composites, significantly surpassing those of the bare (TiO2: 210 μmol/g/h, Sr2Nb2O7: 88 μmol/g/h) and binary (TiO2–rGO: 430 μmol/g/h, Sr2Nb2O7–rGO: 176 μmol/g/h, and Sr2Nb2O7–TiO2: 880 μmol/g/h) photocatalysts. The enhanced performance of the Sr2Nb2O7–rGO–TiO2 composite is attributable to the synergistic effect of rGO acting as an electron-transfer bridge. Thus, with the integration of rGO, absorption is attainable in an extended range up to 445 nm (2.90 eV), suggesting that the composite material could enable the catalyst to absorb more visible light. Additionally, the composite exhibited minor degradation after five consecutive cycles, demonstrating its excellent stability and reusability for hydrogen generation. Based on a comprehensive evaluation of the ESR and transient photocurrent response, a potential Z-scheme mechanism for the photocatalytic H2 generation activity over Sr2Nb2O7–rGO–TiO2 was suggested. The Z-scheme processability allows more electrons to contribute to the H2 evolution reduction.

Comparison of pristine heteropoly acid, BiVO4, and nanocomposites rGO-ED-BiVO4-WCo-30, rGO-ED-BiVO4-WCu-30 and rGO-ED-BiVO4-WCuCo-20, demonstrated that employing rGO-ED-BiVO4-WCuCo-30 increased the degradation efficiency of NF and RB to 95.6% and 97.8%, proving that W/Cu/Co deposition is a useful method for boosting BiVO4's photocatalytic activity. The enhanced electron transfer capacity may be attributed in large part to the incorporation of W, Cu, and Co oxide, which acts as a potent electron driving force. After five cycles of reusing rGO-ED-BiVO4-WCuCo-30, a slight decrease in the degradation efficiency was noticed. LC-MS identified the generation of possible intermediates along the norfloxacin degradation pathway. Overall, a simple technique to synthesize SMAO catalysts for the visible light mediated heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation of pharmaceutical and dye contaminants is reported.

As prepared catalysts were well characterized by means of numerous sophisticated analytical tools. Amongst samples prepared, the BiFeC-1 showed excellent photocatalytic activity towards degradation of methylene blue (MB) (97% in 2h) as well as tetracycline (TC) (89% in 1h) as compared to that of their bare counterparts (45% and 42% for BiVO4, 29% and 18% for α -Fe2O3, respectively). The significant improved photocatalytic performance of Z scheme BiFeC-1 can be ascribed to improved specific surface area (due to an altered morphology of BiVO4 fern leaves), boosted light harvesting ability and redox properties, thereby leading to inhibition of the recombination of charge carriers. Moreover, the high photo-stability and reusability of optimal BiFeC-1 was confirmed by conducting recycle experiments consecutively over five times for MB as well as TC.

In this work, a type of biochar-based composite photocatalysts is fabricated by a facile green microwave-assisted aqueous chemical deposition, which consists of monodispersed Zn0.2Cd0.8S nanoparticles (ZCS NPs) uniformly decorating on three-dimensional (3D) biochar aerogel (BA) derived from the biomass castoff tangerine peel. As-engineered ZCS/BA composite photocatalysts exhibit significantly strengthened photocatalytic activities under solar irradiation, in which the optimal 0.4ZCS/BA sample (0.4 represents the molar of ZCS) achieves the average photocatalytic hydrogen production efficiency of 10.52 mmol g−1∙h−1, being 24.5 folds higher than that of monolithic ZCS alloy. The boosted photocatalytic hydrogen evolution is ascribed to the synergistic effect on the heteroarchitecture with the closely interfacial interaction, which is beneficial for increasing the broad-spectrum sunlight absorption, promoting the photo-induced charge carriers separation efficiency, and accelerating the chemical reaction dynamic rate by the photothermal effect. The step-scheme (S-scheme) electron transfer mechanism for binary ZCS/BA heterojunction is proposed based on the experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The study guides a practical approach to developing biochar-based composites for highly efficient utilization of agricultural biomass resources as well as conversion of solar energy to fuel in photocatalysis.

This work proposed a urea removal strategy involving the VUV/UV/chlorine process in an acidic solution to achieve high-efficiency urea removal. VUV/UV/chlorine could thoroughly remove urea of 2 mg/L within 9 min at pH 3. A TN removal rate of 70% and a dissolved organic carbon removal rate of 84% were achieved in the urea degradation process. The decrease in pH and the increase in oxidant dosage could improve urea removal efficiency. The presence of chloride anion could improve urea removal by 55–85%. Based on the radical probe and quenching experiments, free radicals accounted for more than 90% of urea removal. •Cl2 − and •OH were calculated to contribute approximately 36% and 22%, respectively, to urea removal. •Cl and •ClO together contributed less than 32%. The chlorination of urea was responsible for less than 10% of urea removal. Nitrogen in urea was transformed efficiently into inorganic nitrogen (N2, ammonium, and nitrate with a rough ratio of 6:1:1.1).

In these systems, solar energy is simultaneously converted into electricity and heat, and they have a better performance than separate photovoltaic panels and solar collectors. For this reason, improving the performance of these systems has always been the focus of researchers. The present numerical research is devoted to the investigation of the effect of using a rotary propeller type turbulator in a concentrating PTHC (CPTHC) on the energy and exergy features of the collector. The results are compared with the data belonging to the cases without a turbulator and with a stationary turbulator. The effect of Reynolds number ( R e ) and rotational speed of the turbulator ( ω ) on the results is investigated. Water is considered as the working fluid of the CPTHC, and its flow is carried out in a turbulent regime. Among the three investigated cases, the best and worst performance belonged to the CPTHCs with a rotary turbulator and without a turbulator, respectively. The results showed that the rise of ω from 0 to 10000 rpm results in a growth in the thermal energy efficiency, total energy efficiency and thermal exergy efficiency by 75.47%–90.17%, 115.80%–130.78% and 0.75%–0.87%, respectively. Additionally, it was explored that the rise of ω entails an ascending-descending trend in the useful electrical power, first law electrical efficiency, second law electrical efficiency and second law total efficiency of the CPTHC, and the maximum value of these parameters occurs at ω = 5000 rpm. The highest total energy efficiency, which was equal to 130.78%, belonged to the case of R e = 20000 and ω = 10000 rpm, while the highest exergy efficiency was equal to 17.24% and belonged to the case of R e = 20000 and ω = 5000 rpm.

Accurate predictions can contribute to reducing chemical usage and CO2 emissions. However, commonly used calculations based solely on pH and metal concentrations may lead to inaccuracies (e.g., ∼2000%). Thus, theory-based geochemical modeling and its assessment with experiments is necessary. In this study, the key factors influencing the dosage and PHREEQ-N-AMDTreat models were assessed using actual (n = 11) and synthetic (n = 7) mine drainage as well as operational data from pilot- and full-scale facilities, targeting pH of >8.3 to treat Mn. The ratios of the actual and simply calculated dosages had a positive linear relationship with the alkalinity of the raw water. Moreover, PHREEQC modeling revealed that the effect of the dissolved inorganic carbon on the increase of the dosage was more dominant compared to that of calcite precipitation. These findings suggest that the discrepancy in dosage arises because H2CO3 0 and HCO3 − are important components of acidity, particularly when the pH is increased to >8.3. Among the three aeration conditions of PHREEQ-N-AMDTreat, aeration to equilibrium exhibited predictions closest to the measured values, owing to the most accurate prediction of Mn concentrations. Thus, PHREEQ-N-AMDTreat under the condition of aeration to equilibrium could predict the alkaline dosages and sludge amounts for wastewater treatment at pH > 8.3, with average actual/predicted values of 119% and 124%, respectively.

Effective water treatment processes are urgently needed to remove MPs from the aquatic environment. Herein, an electrocatalytic oxidation system with a CeO2-modified PbO2 anode (marked as CeO2–PbO2) was proposed for the degradation of polyvinyl chloride microplastics (PVC-MPs). When the CeO2 concentration in the electrodeposition solution was 0.005 M, the obtained CeO2–PbO2 electrode had the best electrocatalytic activity due to its denser structure, higher oxygen evolution potential, and more active sites. After 6 h of electrolysis, the weight loss of PVC-MPs at the CeO2–PbO2-0.005 anode was 38.67%, greatly higher than 16.67% at the pristine PbO2 anode. To explore the degradation mechanism of PVC-MPs, the surface morphologies, elemental states, and functional groups of PVC-MPs were compared before and after electrochemical treatment, and the formed intermediates were identified. Experimental results revealed that the PVC backbones were broken, the CC double bonds were oxidized or oxidatively cleaved into small molecules, and the dechlorination reaction occurred in the electrochemical oxidation process. As a result, the particle size of the PVC-MPs decreased significantly, lots of cracks appeared and many small pieces were formed on the surface of the PVC-MPs.

This study proposed a solution to address this issue by using oyster shells as an alternative conditioner. Results indicated that the UASB reactor with oyster shells conditioning exhibited a significant increase in methane production from 243 to 435 mL/g-chemical oxygen demand (COD)removed, as the organic loading rate increased from 2.5 to 7.1 kg-COD/(m3·d). This value surpassed that of the control reactor, which experienced a sharp decline in performance. Furthermore, it also exceeded the majority of reported methane yields ranging from 150 to 330 mL/g-CODremoved. The pH adjustment and additional supply of carbon dioxide from oyster shells was primarily responsible for the substantial increase in methane production. Moreover, oyster shell conditioning resulted in improvements in specific methanogenic activity, extracellular polymeric substances protection, and settling capacity of anaerobic granular sludge, as well as the enrichment in Methanosaeta abundance, and strengthening of methanogenic functional activity. All these factors contributed to the successful methanogenesis of starch wastewater in UASB reactor through oyster shell conditioning. These findings highlighted the potential of using oyster shells as a favorable conditioner for optimizing UASB treatment of easily acidified wastewater (e.g., starch wastewater), which presented promising practical applications.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139776";"Remediation of diesel-oil contaminated soils using an innovative nanobubble and electrolyzed catalytic system ";" Soil contamination resulting from petroleum hydrocarbons poses a significant environmental challenge. In this research, an innovative electrolyzed catalytic system was devised to produce nanobubble-enriched catalytic water, which was employed for remediating soils contaminated with diesel oil. This novel system harnessed high voltage (220 V) via direct current, utilizing titanium electrodes coated with iridium dioxide. The inclusion of iron-copper hybrid oxide catalysts between the electrodes was instrumental in enhancing the efficiency of radical generation. The study employed the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique and the Rhodamine B (RhB) method to analyze the species and concentration of the generated radicals. EPR is a versatile tool for investigating materials with unpaired electrons and is capable of quantifying reaction kinetics for transition metals. RhB can be used as a probe for hydroxyl radical concentration determination. The addition of an electrolyte (NaCl or K2SO4) could enhance the electrolytic reaction and improve radical production rate. By incorporating 20 mM of K2SO4 and utilizing 75 g of catalyst per 500 mL batch of nanobubble-contained electrolyzed catalytic water (NECW) production, with a current density of 20 mA/cm2, a highly oxidized nanobubble-infused electrolyzed catalytic water was successfully generated. This water exhibited an oxidation-reduction potential of 887 mV and contained a radical concentration of 7.6 × 10−13 M, encompassing hydroxyl, superoxide, and sulfate radicals. Furthermore, it displayed a negative zeta potential of −39.8 mV, along with nanobubbles averaging 28 nm in diameter and a nanobubble density of 3.7 × 109 particles per milliliter. The presence of nanobubbles in electrolyzed catalytic water, owing to their negative zeta potential and nano-scale attributes, imparts a repulsive force that hinders bubble aggregation and prolongs their existence. When these nanobubbles burst, the resulting radicals contribute to an augmented radical concentration, which, in turn, facilitates the oxidation of petroleum hydrocarbons. Approximately 72.4% of the total petroleum hydrocarbon in soils could be removed (dropped from 3230 mg/kg to 892 mg/kg) after five batches of NECW washing (10 min of each washing time) via the desorption and extended chemical oxidation mechanisms. The total petroleum hydrocarbons in the water phase could be removed entirely after pumping the polluted water into the electrolyzed catalytic system for immediate treatment, indicating that the electrolyzed catalytic system could oxidize the desorbed total petroleum hydrocarbon effectively. The findings demonstrate that the nanobubble-infused catalytic water generated by the innovative electrolyzed system effectively and efficiently remediates petroleum-hydrocarbon-contaminated soils and water, all while minimizing the risk of secondary pollution.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139587";"Public tap water perceptions and potable reuse acceptance: A cognitive dissonance theoretical understanding ";" Water scarcity is a pressing issue caused by many factors, including urban water demand, poor wastewater management, and climate change. To address this growing issue, wastewater recycling for potable use is encouraged worldwide. Planned potable reuse (PPR) involves reusing treated wastewater intentionally as a drinking water source. PPR promotes a circular water economy and reduces local water shortages. However, public acceptance of PPR remains low due to the psychological disgust associated with consuming treated wastewater, known as the yuck factor. Traditional educational marketing campaigns have been ineffective in increasing PPR acceptance, necessitating further investigation into other approaches to do so. This study analyzes whether consumers’ perceptions about their current tap water significantly links to their attitudes toward PPR. Guided by the cognitive dissonance theoretical framework, our study examines if public tap water customers who (1) already believe their drinking water contains treated wastewater (de facto reuse) and (2) trust their public water suppliers (PWS) are more likely to accept PPR. Two separate survey-based studies were conducted in 2019 and 2020 on adult public water consumers in the US. Statistical analyses reveal that those participants who believe their tap water contains de facto reuse water, have high trust in their PWS, or primarily consume tap water (behavioral trust) demonstrate greater acceptance of PPR. Additionally, our results suggest that acceptance toward PPR increased after the COVID pandemic, but this effect is moderated by gender. Overall, our study results indicate that addressing cognitive dissonance in consumer attitudes toward PPR may lead to more sustainable solutions for water management in the US. Further research should explore the interplay between de facto reuse beliefs, trust, and PPR acceptance, to enable the development of effective prosocial marketing strategies that can overcome the yuck factor and ultimately promote wider consumer acceptance of PPR.

Using dimethyl sulfate as a common anion, we synthesized imidazolium-based cations with varying chain lengths (Imidazole, 2-methyl imidazole, 2-ethyl imidazole, and 2-isopropyl imidazole). This allowed us to create novel room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) that can be stored and transported at room temperature. These RTILs were further modified to magnetic ionic liquid composites (MILCs) by adding iron-alumina composites. The synthesized RTILs and MILCs were further characterized using H-NMR, FTIR, TGA, SEM, and EDX techniques. The process of adsorption at varying parameters was studied for the removal of Congo red (CR) and microplastics using these materials. MILC-4 in results, demonstrated excellent adsorption effectiveness by reaching a high removal rate of 90% at a concentration of 10 ppm for CR. Furthermore, 10-μm polystyrene beads were successfully destroyed by the MILCs in about 30 min. Following the completion of 40 experimental data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model with three layers was used to accurately predict the removal of CR dye from an aqueous solution by MILCs. For the prediction and modeling of CR dye removal, the minimal mean squared error (MSE) of 0.051 and coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.97 were discovered. These numerical findings demonstrate the amazing effectiveness of the synthesized MILCs in combating water pollution issues. Overall, the study emphasizes the necessity of cleaner production methods and sustainable solutions provided by MILCs for CR dye and microplastics removal from water bodies.

Granulated activated carbon (GAC) and iron impregnated granular activated carbon (GAC-Fe) are the two adsorbents which have shown significant removal of arsenic (As(V)). However, the synthesis of different adsorbents involves significant different materials and energy interactions which have different environmental and economic burdens. This study evaluates and compares the environmental impacts arising from treatment of arsenic containing water using GAC and GAC-Fe adsorbents, for the selection of more suitable one. The life cycle inventory pertaining to treatment through two adsorbents was prepared based on the data available in literature. The impacts were assessed utilizing ‘Sphera LCA for experts’ software with three midpoint methods i.e. CML 2001, TRACI 2.1 and ReCiPe 2016. Results show that chemically treated/impregnated adsorbents for arsenic contaminated water treatment not only have lesser environmental emissions but also reduces the treatment cost. The treatment with GAC-Fe has ∼30% lower impacts in GWP, AP, EP, MAETP, FAETP, ODP, ADP (E) and HTP categories than treatment with GAC, since increase in adsorbent's specific uptake in GAC-Fe reduces the amount of total adsorbent requirement. GAC-Fe based water treatment costs ∼23% less than with GAC. The main responsible parameters for emissions are synthesis of GAC from hard coal precursor, and electricity consumption in carbonization and drying operations. Apart from this, in case of GAC-Fe, additional impregnation and drying operation also contributes to emissions. The utilization of coke oven gas generated in adsorbent synthesis for energy credits has potentially reduced the emissions and operating cost. The less standard deviation (<10%) in Monte Carlo (MC) uncertainty analysis, indicated the reliability and robustness of LCA impacts. This study exemplified the environment friendliness of metal impregnated GAC based arsenic contaminated water treatment.

However, the direct use of phosphorus in sewage sludge in agriculture is controversial. This paper uses Denmark, Germany, and Spain as case examples to assess relevant legislation and boundary conditions in agricultural production to identify opportunities and barriers for the utilisation of recycled phosphorus from wastewater in agriculture on a regional level. Only five out of 22 phosphorus recycling technologies considered were in full compliance with legislation across all three countries, and these five were then assessed for their potential to supply phosphorus to major crops within countries. We considered the application of technologies across four scenarios: 1) struvite; 2) vivianite as iron supply; 3) vivianite for calcium phosphate precipitation; and 4) ashes for calcium phosphate precipitation. The most suitable scenario identified for Denmark was vivianite for calcium phosphate precipitation, whereas in Spain vivianite as iron supply was identified as most suitable, and ashes for calcium phosphate in Germany. We found that in 2018, the potential phosphorus supply from recycling technologies was on average 0.38, 0.29 and 0.05 kg of phosphorus per capita for Danish, German, and Spanish regions. These quantities could meet 9.1, 21.7, and 10.0 percent of the phosphorus required to produce major cereals in each country (specifically wheat, barley, and rye). Given current legal constraints, wastewater treatment plant connections and agronomic context, the potential contribution of recycled phosphorus is non-negligible in many sub-national regions.

This study proposed the incorporation of light and algal-bacterial symbiotic particles (ABSP)into RAS as a viable solution to address these challenges. The findings indicated that ABSP achieved the RAS water quality standards (ammonia nitrogen <0.5 mg/L, nitrite nitrogen <0.1 mg/L) by the 14th day of operation, while red light achieved and maintained these standards from as early as the 9th day. Further analysis of chemical stoichiometry and functional genes revealed that microalgae (32.7%, 15.6%, 0%) and bacteria (47.7%, 55.8%, 48.4%) were responsible for the assimilation and removal of most organic and nutrient substances under red light, white light, and dark conditions, respectively. Additionally, it was observed that the presence of algae and bacteria in ABSP was significantly influenced by the wavelength of light. Under red light, an optimal distribution of functional species for both microalgae (Characium, Microcoleus, and Uronema) and bacteria (Nakamurella and Micropruina) was achieved, which is crucial for the self-sustaining synergistic reaction and stability of ABSP.

However, the generation of disinfection by-products (DBPs) in the chlorination process is threatening drinking water safety, especially when the concentration of natural organic matter (NOM) is high in source water. Climate change increases the fluctuation of NOM in source water, which further challenges water safety in small and rural communities. In this study, environmental microfluidics was introduced to a UVA-LED photocatalytic oxidation system for a rapid oxidation of NOM. The results showed that HA adsorption and degradation, and DOC degradation were more favored in low pH. At pH 5, 56.9% of HA and 58.1% of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) were removed in 3.4 min by the microreactor. DBP formation potential was efficiently reduced, with the highest reduction of THM and HAA formation potentials by 76% and 70.7%, respectively. Compared with the bottle reactor, the degradation rate constants of HA and DOC by UVA-LED microreactor were increased by 2.99 – 15.8 times, and 6.8 – 170.2 times, respectively. Homogenous irradiation and rapid mass transfer in the microreactor accelerated the inhibited oxidation of HA in acidic and base solutions and increased the apparent quantum yields of photocatalysis. Further, the microfluidic photocatalytic oxidation was much more efficient in the reduction of DPBs formation potential in a source water sample.

Amino acid functionalized nickel ferrite nanoparticles were chosen to improve the stability of bare nanoparticles and prevent oxidation and leaching ions in nanoparticles thereby targeting the antibiotics in the contaminated water bodies. The removal of ciprofloxacin and lomefloxacin hydrochloride in the aqueous phase was investigated using a hydrothermally synthesized L-Leucine functionalized nickel ferrite nanocomposite (NFO@L). Various analytical techniques were used to analyze L-Leucine functionalized nickel ferrite, and the nanocomposite's average particle diameter was determined to be between 11 and 15 nm. The maximal measured zeta potential was −21.5 mV. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), ninhydrin assay and X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis confirmed the attachment of L-Leucine onto nickel ferrite. The nanocomposite's surface-to-volume ratio was calculated to be 92.916 m2/g. The S-shaped curve from the vibrating sample magnetometer analysis reflected the superparamagnetic behaviour of the nanocomposite with a saturation magnetization of 0.665 emu/g. Various parametric experiments were conducted, in which 93.549% ciprofloxacin was removed in 120 min at 303 K, pH 8 and NFO@L dosage of 100 mg in 100 mL whereas 75.192% lomefloxacin hydrochloride was removed in 140 min at 333 K, pH 9 and NFO@L dosage of 70 mg in 100 mL.

In this study, we designed Cu-doped Mn3O4 as a heterogeneous catalyst for PMS activation to degrade carbamazepine (CBZ) under alkaline conditions. Remarkably, at low catalyst dosage (30 mg/L) and low PMS dosage (100 mg/L), complete removal of CBZ (100%) was achieved within 5 min in the Cu1.5Mn1.5O4/PMS system at pH 11. The kinetic constant for CBZ degradation was determined to be 1.128 min−1, which is 94.0 times higher than that of the Mn3O4/PMS system. SO4 ∙-, ∙OH, and 1O2 were generated in the Cu1.5Mn1.5O4/PMS system, with SO4 ∙- playing a key role in CBZ degradation. The Cu site in Cu1.5Mn1.5O4 was identified as the active site responsible for PMS activation. Cu doping enhanced the –OH group generation and electron transfer of Cu1.5Mn1.5O4, leading to its high catalytic activity towards SO5 2−. The generation of free radicals was found to be associated with the Cu(I)/Cu(II) cycle, while Mn(III) promoted the redox cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II).

Adsorption of these contaminants by activated carbon in water treatment plants is well-known; however, a problem resides in the handling of the spent adsorbents. As current regenerative technologies are expensive, the adsorbents are often destructed or landfilled. Here, we examine a novel regeneration method for the used adsorbents with subcritical water – i.e., hydrothermal treatment. The degradation of three well-known emerging contaminants – caffeine, trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole – was studied with regard to processing temperature (160–280 °C), concentration (2 and 20 mg/L), and the impact of adsorbents. In addition to trimethoprim in the mix at 20 mg/L, the other contaminants were entirely degraded at 280 °C. To obtain insight into transformation products formed during hydrothermal regeneration, we performed non-target and targeted analyses with LC-MS-QTOF using two types of columns, C18 and ZIC-HILIC. This approach ensured a wide range of hydrophilicities. Results showed more transformation products for trimethoprim (20) compared to sulfamethoxazole and caffeine (4).

United Nations reports mentioned by 2050 about five billion people of the world's population will face at least one month of water shortages. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), world energy consumption will increase by almost 50% between 2018 and 2050. A desalination process that involves the use of solar stills (SS) to obtain fresh water has been studied as a possible solution to these problems. It combines the three key processes of evaporation, condensation, and energy supply into one unit. Less than 5 L/m2/d of productivity and 45% efficiency are the downsides of the SS system, which operates under normal atmospheric pressure conditions. Thus, a major objective of this article is to review the performance and productivity improvements in the SS system. A full review of the SS system operating sub-atmospheric pressure conditions powered by renewable energy will be explained. The vacuum SS system was divided into two main sub-systems: natural and forced vacuum SS systems. Natural vacuum SS was classified into single and multi-stage, while forced vacuum SS was categorized into single and multi-effect. Previous studies as well as the most important recent advancements in this field were comprehensively presented. For example, recent developments in one-, two-, three-, four-, five- and multi module-effect forced vacuum systems are discussed. A single-stage natural vacuum SS system has reached a maximum efficiency of 76.96%. While the efficiency of about 86% made to the multi-stage natural vacuum SS. In general, maximum efficiency was achieved in single and multi-effect forced vacuum SS at almost 76.66% and 87%, respectively. The forced vacuum SS system is superior to the natural vacuum SS system because it removes non-condensable gases that hinder the operation process and produces continuously flowing fresh water. Gaps and vulnerabilities in the vacuum SS system were found after reviewing and analysing earlier studies. As a result, a hypothetical scenario for future study into vacuum SS systems was presented.

Chemical-based wastewater treatment processes typically involve significant consumption of resources, by means of chemical or material uses, which potentially lead to significant environmental impacts. This study intends to gain a comprehensive understanding of the environmental impacts associated with two Fenton-based wastewater treatment processes, namely, fluidized-bed reactor (FBR-Fenton) and conventional Fenton (C-Fenton) methods, for four industrial wastewater tests (organic wastewater from pulp mill, pharmaceutical, oil-containing, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) rinsing), from a technical suitability perspective. The present study adopts ISO 14040 guidelines for life cycle assessment (LCA) and uses the IPCC and ReCiPe methods for environmental impact assessment. The results show that the FBR process has relatively lower environmental impacts than the C-Fenton process according to the IPCC and ReCiPe impact results, partly due to differences in chemical usage and electricity consumption. The results obtained from the IPCC method show that the C-Fenton process had a relatively higher impact on global warming potential than the FBR process, with impacts in the range of 20.5–141.9 kg CO2eq/1 kg COD and 12.0–41.9 kg CO2eq/1 kg COD, respectively, mainly due to variations in the amount of sodium hydroxide or sulfuric acid required to achieve the desired degree of water quality from different raw industrial wastewater sources. Furthermore, the reduction in the use of high-impact chemicals contributes to remarkable environmental benefits for the processes, while process adjustment may not guarantee environmental benefits. This result implies that the environmental performance of Fenton-based processes significantly varies depending on the treatment of raw wastewater characteristics; that is, the environmental advantage of a wastewater treatment technique strongly depends on the determination of a suitable process.

This work presents the successful use of solid and stable ZnO nanorods fabricated by anodization as an adsorbent and photocatalyst for water treatment, circumventing the requirement of any post treatments currently needed with powder catalyst. The ZnO nanorods well- characterized structurally, morphologically and compositionally by a variety of methods manifest superior photocatalytic property than adsorption ability. Scavenger tests indicate that the photocatalytic action is controlled predominantly by superoxide (*O2 −) radicals. Kinetic studies reveal that adsorption of MO as well as CR follow pseudo second order model favouring chemisorption, while adsorption isotherms correlate well with the Freundlich model suggesting heterogenous mode of dye adsorption. The photocatalyst manifests good cyclic stability with reduction in dye degradation efficiency by only 4–8 % in the fourth cycle of operation.

Herein, a kind of cerium oxide (CeO2) loaded layered double hydroxide (LDH) composites that was fabricated by seeds embedded epitaxial growth based on hydrothermal method anchored on a three-dimensional porous polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) framework (denoted as CeO2@LDH-PVDF) and function as an efficient catalytic activator for peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. This module features as lamellar LDH nano-flowers not only in situ anchoring onto both sides of the PVDF surface but also along the wall of the pores in an ab-plane vertically interlaced growth pattern. A packed tower device suitable for the catalytic module is also proposed as proof of concept for consecutive pollutants disposal. This module exhibits dual functions of filtration and oxidation, demonstrating a promising removal efficiency for tetracycline (95.8%, 30 mg/L) in conjunction with PMS. Accurate operation parameters are obtained by using the response surface methodology to further reduce the energy consumption (CeO2 containing: 9.03%, PMS concentration: 0.798 mM; pH: 6.513). Encouragingly, the CeO2@LDH-PVDF is not only capable of achieving ultrafast removal in flowing various contaminants, but also reveals wide practical applicability in tap water and reservoir. Moreover, it provides evidence that the binding force between LDH and PVDF is enhanced by virtue of the unique “Mortise-Tenon” structure, which is conducive to maintaining the catalytic activity. Furthermore, the formation of a complex of M−(HO)OSO3 − and the succeeding redox cycle of Ni2+/Ni3+, Fe2+/Fe3+, Co2+/Co3+ explain the generation of reactive radicals in PMS activation. Moreover, a new redox cycle of Ce3+/Ce4+ promotes the utilization efficiency of PMS. Three possible tetracycline degradation pathways are proposed and the toxicity of the by-products is reduced. Finally, the module possesses an ideal universality, good cycling stability, favorable antifouling performance, and superior renewability. It is predicted to be integrated with multiple mature technologies to conduct industrial water treatment due to its changeable shape and durability.

Two different CDIMD systems of forward-CDIMD (ACFF linking to positive poles) and reversed-CDIMD (ACFF liking to negative poles) were established in this study to investigate the impacts of electric field form on the desalination efficiency. The severe membrane flux decline of MD (83.17%, 168 h) was clearly mitigated in the CDIMD system, which was respectively 52.93% and 69.82% for the forward-CDIMD and reversed-CDIMD group. In terms of the CDIMD system without input voltage, an anabatic flux drop to 8.85% was observed in the later period, implying the necessity of periodic regeneration for ACFF and CNTs-PTFE. The membrane scaling induced by the deposition of CaSO4, as the core drawback of MD application, has been remarkably solved in the CDIMD system, especially in the forward-CDIMD system. Although the ACFF and CNTs-PTFE were periodically regenerated in the forward- and reversed-CDIMD system, an increasing appearance of crystals was observed inside the ACFF and CNTs layer along with the long-term seawater desalination, accordingly degrading their electrochemical performance. Hence, the forward-CDIMD system with an abbreviated time-set of adsorption/desorption phase might be a superior choice for efficient seawater desalination.

Studies focused on improving this technique based on using magnetized water, as well as on investigating its effects on medicinal plant production processes, remain incipient in the literature. Some benefits of this technique are the optimization of the quality and quantity of irrigation water, economy of the water absorbed by the plants, improvement in the vegetative growth and productivity, reduction of the use of fertilizers and the greater availability of nutrients in the soil for crops compared to irrigation using conventional water. Thus, the aim of the current study is to assess the effect of different magnetized and non-magnetized water irrigation levels on Melissa officinalis growth, nutritional status and essential oil compounds in plants grown in protected environment. The experimental design consisted of completely randomized design with two water types (magnetized and non-magnetized) and four irrigation levels (25%, 75%, 100% and 125% of crop evapotranspiration - ETc) with four replications. Irrigation conducted with different magnetized water levels had significant effect on the accumulation of nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and of all micronutrients in plants’ leaves, and on soluble protein contents. The study also demonstrated significant effects of magnetically treated irrigation water on major chemical compounds such as citral (neral + geranial) and citronellal on the leaves of lemon balm plants. Different water levels significantly affected plant dry weight production parameters. In this study it was shown that the plant treated with magnetized water required less amount of water applied being a promising potential in saving water resources that will be of significant importance in the future. Overall, the results need to be further tested under field conditions to assess the usefulness of magnetic irrigation water treatment.in cultivation with medicinal, aromatic and spice plants.

The present study aims to examine groundwater quality for 15 water quality parameters from 84 stations in arid and semi-arid districts of Rajasthan, India, using annual data from 2000 to 2018. Statistical methods such as descriptive test statistics, Mann-Kendall (MK) test, Sen’s slope estimation, and Principal component analysis (PCA) were used to analyze the hydrochemical parameters. While World Health Organisation (WHO) and Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) guidelines were used to assess the suitability of groundwater for domestic purposes, sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), electrical conductivity (EC), and United States Salinity (USSL) diagrams were used for irrigation suitability. Further Generalized Additive Model (GAM) was used to explore the effect of climatic (precipitation, temperature) and anthropogenic (net irrigated area (NIA), fertilizer usage, industrialization, and population) variables on groundwater quality. The empirical results reveal that in groundwater of the study area sodium (Na+) and potassium (K+) were the dominating cations, while chloride (Cl−) and bicarbonate (HCO3 −) were the dominating anions. The groundwater was predominantly Na–Cl type. Further, most stations witnessed an increasing trend in calcium, magnesium, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate and sulphate and a decreasing trend in potassium, fluoride and nitrate. The SAR, EC, and USSL indicate that the groundwater in the region is suitable for irrigation if salinity control measures are implemented. Chloride, fluoride and sodium concentrations exceeded the prescribed guideline limits in most stations, jeopardizing the suitability of water for drinking and posing significant health hazards. The GAM analysis revealed that anthropogenic variables significantly impact the groundwater quality parameters compared to the climatic variables. Accordingly, it is suggested that anthropogenic parameters must be addressed while formulating groundwater resource management policies. Thus, policies should focus on the stringent enactment of regulations and guidelines controlling the excessive use of fertilizers, implementing proper disposal of municipal solid and liquid waste, and managing industrial pollutants.

Through the experiment, it was determined that the pyrolysis of Enteromorpha and Chlorella vulgaris was carried out at 500 °C at the mixing ratio of 2∶8. The obtained biochar was mixed with NaOH at 1∶0.5 and activated at 800 °C. The mixed algae-based adsorbent had the highest removal rate of tetracycline (97.56%). To further evaluates the environmental impact of the adsorbent preparation process, OpenLCA was applied to the three adsorbent preparation processes using Enteromorpha (EN), Chlorella vulgaris (CV) and mixed algae (MIX). The results show that EN-based adsorbent preparation has the least environmental impact. This is because CV requires much freshwater during cultivation, while EN is cultured in ocean. The culture of CV-based and MIX-based adsorbents account for the majority of all environmental impact indicators. For example, the CO2 emissions of CV and MIX culture account for 75.05% and 69.21% in preparation process, respectively. The sensitivity analysis showed that the environmental impact indicators of CV-based and MIX-based adsorbents preparation was extremely sensitive to aquaculture water. If 80% of the aquaculture water is replaced with aquaculture wastewater, the environmental impact of the MIX-based adsorbent preparation will be the least of the three schemes.

This study investigated the characteristics of water quality of a receiving river, further, the conversion of microbial metabolites and its influences on denitrification in pilot anaerobic biofilter (ABF) and biological aerated filter (BAF) were revealed. On this basis, the feasibility of using the combination of ABF and BAF to purify the receiving river was verified. Results showed that organics dominated by macromolecular microbial metabolites and nitrogen severely polluted the receiving river. Microbial metabolism along the river aromatized the organics and enlarged their molecular weight but failed to effectively remove them. In ABF, the bioavailability of organics was at least triply improved by cleaving macromolecular aromatic rings into small molecular aliphatic compounds. Under this circumstance, denitrifiers utilized aromatic carbon sources preferentially and generated aliphatic products. Low hydraulic loading (HL) enhanced not only the hydrolysis of macromolecular ingredients but the dearomatization. Similarly, although high HLs allowed retaining more aromatic compounds, they worsened the conversion of macromolecules. When the HL was 0.2 m/h, the balance was achieved and more than 80% of the nitrates were removed in ABF.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138779";"Elucidating the relation between residual oxidants formation behavior and quinolone antibiotic removal efficiency on catalytic ozonation in seawater-based aquaculture wastewater ";" Owing to the recent developments in aquaculture, the discharge of antibiotic-laden wastewater has become a growing concern. Quinolone antibiotics, which cause central nervous system and cardiac conduction disorders, are commonly detected in aquaculture wastewater. To remove antibiotics in wastewater, the ozone process is a commonly utilized method. In the process of seawater ozone treatment, bromide ions (Br − ) produce total residual oxidant, such as hypobromous acid (HOBr). However, the oxidation potential of the total residual oxidant (TRO) is lower than that of ozone, and the presence of inhibitors, such as ammonium, and dimethyl sulfide can reduce the residual oxidant concentration. Therefore, the seawater ozone process requires a higher ozone injection than freshwater. In this study, various factors affecting TRO production were evaluated to determine the optimal ozone-catalytic process using gamma-alumina and elucidate the relationship between TRO production and antibiotic removal efficiency for efficient seawater-based wastewater treatment. The removal rates of representative quinolone antibiotics, such as enrofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and oxolinic acid, were evaluated using liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection. The addition of a catalyst enabled the reaction to maintain a higher TRO concentration and improves antibiotic removal efficiency, even in the presence of ammonium in the aquaculture wastewater with the same ozone dosage applied. The results reveal that the ozone-catalyst process contributes to increased TRO production to suppress bacterial growth and effectively remove non-degradable organic matter, such as antibiotics, in seawater-based wastewater treatment.

However, the EfOM evolution process is still unclear in the various advanced wastewater treatment processes. In this study, the EfOM evolution process in terms of components, structures, and functional groups was investigated in four kinds of UV-based advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). The overall EfOM removal performances were in the order: UV/NaClO > UV/PMS > UV/H2O2 > UV. According to the spectroscopic analysis results, simple aliphatics/aromatic/acetylenes compounds with C–O, =C–H, amides, or amino structures deriving from protein-like substances, are easily destroyed under UV irradiation. Apart from these structures, microbial metabolic was strongly sensitive to a reactive chlorine species (RCS)-dominated system, especially nutrients, amino acids, and small peptides with ester. Total of 22 species of halogen by-products with high biotoxicity (acetonitrile-based chlorinated EfOM, chlorinated acetate, chlorinated methane) were detected in the UV/NaClO group. In contrast, the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dominated systems exhibited strong structure selectivity for ester (UV/H2O2) and carbonyl (UV/PMS) in all of the EfOM components, exhibiting strong reaction activity with EfOM at different stages. The results reveal the EfOM evolution in different UV-based AOPs, providing a strategy for selecting suitable UV-based AOPs in the advanced wastewater treatment process in terms of high-efficiency removal of EfOM.

However, restricted by the retention time of the contaminant in membrane, exceptional degradation efficiency is usually achieved at lower permeation conditions. Herein, to improve the permeance while maintaining high degradation efficiency, heterogeneous Cu doping was employed to tune the electronic structure of LaCoO3 perovskite, and the catalytic activity was further optimized by modulating Cu: Co ratios. Besides, Cu-doped LaCoO3 was anchored in a SiO2 fiber membrane with decent connectivity. Benefiting from the enriched local concentration of the reactants and highly connected fiber structures, attractive catalytic efficiency and permeability can be achieved simultaneously. About 99% of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) was degraded within 12 min with a k constant of 0.4765 min−1, and the flux reached up to 2575.4 L/m2h under gravity, which was 10–70 times higher than other reported catalytic membranes. Density functional theory proved the enhanced interaction between PMS and catalytic membrane, and mechanism analysis demonstrated that singlet oxygen and sulfate radicals dominated the TC degradation process.

These applications have stimulated new investigations into stability mechanisms —an essential prerequisite for their effective practical utilization. Producing nanobubbles with stable and measurable properties is a critical endeavour to broaden their applications. However, several challenges persist in the basic theoretical understanding of bulk nanobubble stability. Several bubble models and mechanisms of action remain uncertain and necessitate comprehensive exploration. This review aims to comprehensively analyze scientific information and experimental data reported in recent years on the mechanisms of nanobubble stability and related applications for aquatic environments. Empirical evidence has demonstrated that bulk nanobubbles can endure for notable spans of time —ranging from weeks to months-as verified through diverse characterization techniques. Nevertheless, this phenomenon poses a theoretical challenge to the conventional Young-Laplace equation. The mechanisms underlying this remarkable stability remain partially understood, creating a barrier to this pioneering technology's advancement and practical implementation. In this critical review, we thoroughly analyze the stability mechanisms of single nanobubble and clusters of nanobubbles, presenting these discussions distinctly. We precisely summarize and deliberate upon the impact of various controlling parameters within the aquatic environment that influence nanobubble stability.

In this paper, the Fe3O4@CQDs magnetic nanocatalyst was successfully prepared by modifying α-Fe2O3, and Rhodamine B (RhB) was degraded by activating PMS under visible light. Moreover, in order to explore the reason why Fe3O4@CQDs was more beneficial to the activation of PMS than α-Fe2O3 at the microscopic level and reaction mechanism, the corresponding DFT calculations were performed. The results revealed that the degradation efficiency of RhB reached 98% in 35 min.

This study presents a conceptual framework to investigate climate change impacts on blue and green water accounting by integrating a hydrological model with a multi-criteria decision-making approach to prioritize watersheds for climate change adaptation. A Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) is adopted to investigate the hydrologic variability of BW and GW for baseline (1995–2019) and future (2020–2100) periods in a semi-arid Dharoi catchment of the Sabarmati River basin, India. The future climate data, derived from five general circulation models, are ensembled using a multi-model ensemble mean approach under two RCP (representative concentration pathways) scenarios. Several non-parametric tests are employed to ascertain statistically significant changes in the hydrologic variables between future and baseline periods. Further, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is applied considering seven attributes related to climate change, land use, and demographic parameters for watershed prioritization. Higher weights are assigned to the climate change attributes, followed by land use and demographic attributes. The SWAT results indicate a decrease in rainfall, BW, and GWS (green water storage) and an increase in temperature and GWF (green water flow) while traversing from the beginning of 2040 till the end of the 21st century under both RCPs. Thus, 2040 is established as a ‘tipping point’ for climate-induced changes in the Dharoi catchment, wherein a distinct reversal in the hydroclimatic regime is evident before and after 2040. Further, significant warming is observed by the end of 21st century under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, contributing to a reduction in rainfall (up to 24.8%) and a decline in BW (up to 78.8%) across two-thirds of the watersheds in the Dharoi catchment. The AHP analysis identifies three out of ten watersheds as vulnerable and assigned ‘high priority’ for implementing adaptation measures to counter climate change-induced water scarcity.

In this study, a novel volume of fluid (VOF)-coupled electrochemical method was developed to investigate the two-phase flow evolution and bubble transport characteristics in flow field of PEMWE. The results show the bubbles in each sub-channel undergo processes of growth, coalescence, separation, and wall adhesion. Besides the liquid water flow velocity and the adhesion of the wall to the bubble, the accumulation of bubbles in the outlet manifold also affects the bubble removal rate, and cause bubble backflow. Hydrophilic anode porous transport layer (APTL) results in higher slug flow proportion in middle channels of flow field, causing lower bubble removal rates. Film and wavy flow formation in hydrophobic APTL significantly delays bubbles reaching the outlet manifold. Moreover, a larger APTL contact angle increases liquid water transport resistance and parasitic power in PEMWE.

However, most of the existing research on UFR mainly focuses on analyzing the UFR level and its main influencing factors, but rarely involves the strategy selection of stakeholders after evaluation and analysis of UFR. To fill this gap, this study, taking Shanghai as an example, applies the hybrid entropy weight method (EWM)-TOPSIS model to develop an index-based measurement to compare and evaluate UFR, and then uses the grey relational analysis (GRA) to find out the main factors affecting UFR. The results showed that the UFR level in Shanghai significantly increased by 39.34% from 2000 to 2020, but the natural resilience showed a fluctuating downward trend. The factors that affect UFR are highly correlated with economic development. The results provide scientific theoretical guidance for the construction of resilient cities. Then, decision makers (DMs) from different departments are involved in the construction and promotion of UFR, and they tend to pay more attention to the factors that are beneficial to them. Based on this, this situation inevitably causes the promotion of UFR in real life to become a conflict problem. Thus, the fuzzy graph model can be used to model and analyze tripartite conflict problems in UFR, and the fuzzy stability analysis represents that state s 4 is the optimal solution of conflicts, which can promote each involver to follow the rules and regulations for constructing the UFR for Shanghai in spirit.

To address this, the potential adaptation of different coupling forms to low temperatures was investigated in a moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) and an integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) reactor for 182 days. The results showed that IFAS reactor achieved higher total nitrogen removal rates (TNRRs) at 15 °C (89.67 ± 0.01%) than MBBR system (77.28 ± 0.02%).

CeO2-N exhibited a higher proportion of Oad and Olat to the formation of Ov. In contrast, CeO2-O possessed a cubic cerianite structure with less Ov.

When the available region of the operating current density is extended, the stack can generate an increased amount of hydrogen. This can directly contribute to green hydrogen being highly competitive compared to other kinds of hydrogen. In this study, numerical analysis was conducted to investigate and optimize the operational characteristics of alkaline water electrolysis (AWE) under high temperature and high current density conditions. The numerical model of the AWE developed in our previous study has been upgraded by considering the crossover of hydrogen gas through the membrane to more accurately determine the Faraday efficiency of hydrogen production and the available safe operating range. Simulation results show that saturated vapor generation significantly affected the performance of both stack and system components in high-temperature environments. Therefore, pressurization is important to ensure the high efficiency of high-temperature water electrolysis, but it must be appropriately adjusted in consideration of gas crossover. In this study, the highest efficiency of 78.52% was captured at 120 °C and 10 bar for 1 A/cm2 operation.

As a signaling molecule, NO influences many aspects of phytoremediation, especially in response to heavy metal stress. The current understanding of the impact of NO on the tolerance of Pistia stratiotes and other plants to Cu2+ in swine wastewater is limited. This study aimed to investigate the impact of NO on the physiological response of Pistia stratiotes and its efficacy in removing pollutants from swine wastewater under varying concentrations of Cu2+ ranging from 1~4 mg/L. The findings showed that NO treatment reduced copper stress at 2~4 mg/L Cu2+ while increasing oxidative stress at 1 mg/L Cu2+. According to an analysis of physiological parameters and copper concentrations, the results found a significant correlation between increased copper tolerance and elevated levels of antioxidants and transport coefficients. The morphology of copper and the results of the principal component analysis indicate that NO facilitated the humification process of the dissolved organic matter. The investigation found that the removal efficiencies of NH3–N, NO3–N, and total phosphorus in NO treatment were enhanced to 95.76%, 88.72%, and 91.89%, respectively. Collectively, it was determined that NO is a regulator of phytoremediation to copper in wastewater via promoting antioxidative, copper transport, DOM bound, nutrients uptake, thus adequate amount could improve the tolerance of Pistia stratiotes to Cu2+. This study is expected to provide a theoretical basis for rationally regulating NO concentration and effectively improving the removal efficiency of copper in swine wastewater.

Water resource spatial equilibrium (WRSE) is an important yardstick for guiding regional water resource planning and sustainable utilization. However, research on the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and driving factors of WRSE is extremely lacking, and few existing studies have considered drought and flood disasters as the important reflection of WRSE. Therefore, this paper proposes a systematic integrated model for WRSE including regional evaluation, spatiotemporal heterogeneity and geodetector analysis functions, and constructs the evaluation index system considering droughts and floods. First, the performance of WRSE is quantified using the general deprivation index (GDI) innovatively. Then, combined with the Moran's I, the spatial patterns and regional differences of WRSE are analyzed. Last, the geographical detector models are employed to perform driving analysis of WRSE. The effectiveness of the model is verified in China. Results show that (1) from 2009 to 2021, the national average of WRSEI exhibits a declining trend from 0.879 in 2009 to 0.789 in 2021. (2) The areas with high WRSEI values are mainly distributed in the western provinces, whereas the eastern region has a higher percentage of imbalanced provinces. (3) Water resources per capita, added value of tertiary industry, urbanization rate and GDP per capita are key driving factors of China’ WRSE. The study provides a novel insight for WRSE improvement and is greatly helpful for developing differentiated management measures to optimize resource allocation.

Hence, remediating this waste into eco-friendlier forms becomes paramount. One effective approach to addressing pollutants is through the electro-reduction or catalytic reduction of harmful substances. This study introduces an innovative solution to this issue by utilizing a mesoporous network structure of cerium aerogels enriched in oxygen vacancies (m-CeO2-xAGL). This was realized via a reverse-engineered borohydride hydrolysis method, which acts as a catalyst for the electro-reduction of 5-nitroquinoline (5-NQ). A synergistic effect between the superior mesoporous network structure, that is, the Ce3+ defect states and rich oxygen vacancies, provided a considerable improvement in the electro-reduction properties toward 5-NQ with an extremely low detection limit (7.5 nM), high sensitivity (1.72 μA μM−1 cm−2) and good linear range (0.05−10 μM & 15−110 μM). Furthermore, the proposed reduction catalyst can be employed for on-site real-time analysis of 5-NQ in agricultural water samples with good recovery. Additionally, the aerogels were tested for catalytic reduction of 5-NQ to 5-aminoquinoline (5-AQ) with NaBH4 in the presence of ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) light. The catalytic rate constant of pristine cerium oxide (p-CeO2) and m-CeO2-xAGL were estimated to be 4.8 × 10−3 m−1 and 6.7 × 10−3 m−1, respectively. This study affirmed that the mesoporous network structure of aerogels with rich oxygen vacancies could be employed effectively for electro and catalytic reduction of 5-NQ.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.138832";"Laboratory observations of solute transport in groundwater basins ";" This paper introduces a method of groundwater pollution source identification obtained from laboratory by a physical instrument of Flow System Sand-Box Model. A Unit basin of a simple flow system and a Tóthian basin of a hierarchically nested flow structure are introduced as case studies. We add step-input solutes at recharge zones, separately or simultaneously, to obtain the breakthrough curves (BTCs) at each discharge zone. For the Unit basin, its BTC shows a gradual upward trend with a decreasing slope but with two more pronounced steps, which differs a lot from previous results of analytical and numerical solutions. These steps are caused by the settings of the current physical instrument as no solutes are input at the upper two discharge ports. For the Tóthian basin, internal steps may exist due to the late-time arrival of intermediate and regional groundwater flow systems. Although the Unit basin and Tóthian basin can both have internal steps in the BTCs, they are due to different reasons. By jointly solving solute mass balance equations with water mass balance equations, the circulation rate for each flow system is calculated, which quantitatively explains the phenomena encountered in the experiment and highlights the important contributions of intermediate and regional flow systems to the entire groundwater circulation. We indirectly obtain the pulse-input BTCs by deriving the step-input BTCs respective to time, which is also the residence time distribution (RTD) of the groundwater basin, that the groundwater pollution sources can be identified. The pulse-input BTC is characterized by peaks and sloping tails. The peaks correspond to the intermediate and regional groundwater flow systems. The sloping tails indicate the rate at which solutes are flushed out or contaminants fade away. By inputting tap water into the groundwater basin to purify the contaminations, we conduct self-purification experiments. The shapes of the solute-input curves and the self-purification curves are systematically symmetrical. As the self-purification experiment has less external interference, it is possible to use the self-purification curves to characterize and identify the groundwater flow system. This study proposes a physical method for identifying sources of groundwater contamination, and achieves a comprehensive understanding of the law of solute transport in groundwater basins, which could guide the prevention of non-point contamination at the basin scale.

Bioelectrochemical systems (BES) are a cutting-edge technology for the sustainable treatment of various types of wastewater while generating energy and value-added chemicals. BESs continuously provide electrons to improve the biological oxidation and reduction efficiency of refractory substances, being more efficient than in-situ bioremediation approaches. However, the BES performance is influenced by various factors, whose alteration can directly affect the processing effect and complicates operation.

It adeptly replicates urban rainfall production and ground runoff, and the Pressure-State-Response (PSR) theory artfully reflects human-environment interactions. Urban Water System Connectivity (UWSC) fortifies connections among regional rivers, transforming them into an intricate, dense network. To study the improvement of the regional water environment by the UWSC project, this study takes the UWSC project in Runan County, Zhumadian, China as the research object, constructs a hydrodynamic and water quality model based on SWMM, and simulates it under different rainfall situations.

This paper evaluates the urban water system connectivity project from three aspects: hydrodynamic, water quality, and ecological effects. Results underscore that the post-UWSC era witnesses decreased river flood flows in varied design rainfalls, accompanied by delayed flood peaks.

Flow rate adjustments align with flow behavior, exhibiting decreased peak flow rates accompanied by temporal lags. Initial river flow increases by about 30%, amplifying river water body exchange capacity.

The performance of the designed heating station was evaluated using the coefficient of performance and the primary return-water temperature and compared with that of other district heating systems. The changes in the district heating system's configuration when the boundary conditions changed were investigated. Results showed that (1) the designed system based on thermal energy discretisation and matching method -had the lowest primary return-water temperature of 18.8 °C and the highest coefficient of performance of 5.62. (2) When the low-temperature load ratio changed from 0% to 100% while maintaining a constant total load, the system's form changed regularly. (3) When the primary supply-water temperature increased, the heating station's form remained unchanged and the capacity of the heat exchange equipment changed regularly. (4) When the secondary supply and return-water temperatures increased, the evaporation temperature of the absorption heat pump increased, resulting in a change in the system's form. This study provides valuable insight into the design of district heating systems that supply dual-temperature water under various design conditions.

This study presents a comprehensive analysis of various aspects of solar desalination systems, including distillate quality, cost estimation, efficiency, and performance comparison. The research involved developing a photovoltaic-based solar desalination system and investigating its distillate quantity and quality, demonstrating its improvement over the conventional system (solar still which comprises a basin and a glass cover) and similar research. A pretreatment system was incorporated to produce a cleaner distillate over conventional solar stills. The results showed an improvement in distillate quantity from 4.7 L/m2 day to 19.7 L/m2 day, for the conventional and modified systems respectively. The pretreatment system enhances the distillate quality with a range of 10–55% in certain parameters. Cost estimation analysis revealed the distillate cost for the traditional and improved systems are 0.041 and 0.091 $/L respectively. A comparison with other studies highlighted the remarkable efficiency of the present study with an average improvement of 30%. It is recommended that future research should be focused on integrating pre-treatment systems, optimizing distillate cost, improving the performance of the conventional system, exploring efficiency enhancements, conducting comparative studies, performing techno-economic analysis, and scaling up.

However, this emerging technique is associated with issues of secondary pollution and great energy consumption during peroxymonosulfate (PMS) or persulfate (PS) activation processes. Herein, a dye pollutant/PS/visible light self-catalytic system was constructed, based on the photosensitive property of organic dyes for PS activation without catalyst and energy input. In this system, the degradation ratio of 100 mL 10 mg L−1 basic fuchsin, rhodamine B and eosin Y significantly increased by 60%, 76% and 50%, compared with the process without light irradiation. Such improvements were attributable to an efficient photo-induced electron transfer from photo-excited dyes to PS, which has the precondition that the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy level of the dye is higher than that of PS, thereby generating oxidizing species like ·SO4 −, ·OH and 1O2 for pollutants degradation. Due to the high performance of pollutants simultaneous removal, wide pH adaptability and anti-interference, the complex self-catalytic system consisted of nine dyes and bis-phenol A exhibited the possibility for practical application. Expectedly, the actual dyeing wastewater self-purification system featured a decolorization efficiency of 54% accompanied by the removal of co-existing aromatic proteins and tryptophan-like substances; moreover, the acute bio-toxicity of the raw wastewater greatly decreased by 61.6%. Owing to its high efficiency, eco-friendliness and low consumption, the constructed “using waste to treat waste” system provides a promising way for wastewater treatment.

Hydroxylamine (HA) promoted activation of persulfate (PS) by the natural metallic sulfide mineral chalcopyrite (CuFeS2) for the removal of pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF) and imidacloprid (IMP) in water had been systematically investigated in this study. Experimental results showed that HA could greatly accelerate the regeneration of Cu2+ and Fe3+ in solutions for PS decomposition. Nearly 99% of CPF removal by CuFeS2/PS/HA process was achieved within 80 min under optimal conditions. The decomposition of PS in the CuFeS2/PS/HA process was higher than that in the CuFeS2/PS process. Several coexisting cations (ie., Ca2+, Mg2+ and Al3+) and anions (ie., HCO3 − and HPO4 2−) presented different levels of negative effects on CPF removal. Both HO• and SO4 •− were generated in the CuFeS2/PS/HA process, and HO• might be the main reactive species responsible for the removal of CPF. The synchronized removal of CPF and IMP by CuFeS2/PS/HA process had been successfully achieved under certain conditions. The possible pathways of CPF degradation and enhanced mechanism for both CPF and IMP removal by CuFeS2/PS/HA process were thereby proposed.

Conventional water treatment technologies and hydrogen production (replacement of fossil fuels) exhibit certain limitations. Therefore, the present research focuses on the application of novel molybdenum-iron (MoFe) nanosheets in the removal of various water pollutants through membrane filtration technology. Furthermore, the used nanocomposite membranes during the water treatment were recycled for hydrogen production through hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Membrane studies depicted excellent rejection of water contaminants through MoFe nanocomposite membrane, i.e., 94%–99% removal for dyes with flux rates up to 288 L/m2.h. Whereas 63.4%, 81.3%, and 98.7% removal were achieved for total dissolved solids, total organic carbon, and turbidity, respectively, and toxic metals exhibited 100% removal with a maximum flux rate of 260 L/m2.h. Moreover, a multi-cycle filtration run for the optimized membrane revealed excellent stability performance. HER studies exhibited the remarkable stability of MoFe-based catalysts during electrochemical activity, and their electrochemical kinetics was found to be quite comparable to platinum (Pt) catalysts. All findings supported the extraordinary potential of MoFe nanosheets in water treatment through membrane filtration and their further application as a sustainable option for hydrogen production during the HER process. Hence, the effectiveness of MoFe nanosheets signifies a promising solution for large-scale applications in both water and energy fields, which can not only enhance water purification and provide an affordable alternative to expensive catalysts used in HER but also overcome the limitations of traditional water treatment techniques and hydrogen production.

The adsorption mechanism allows the use of cheap adsorbents. In particular, using bioadsorbents developed with biocompatible materials is an environmentally friendly approach. This study aims to determine the textile dye Reactive Red 120 (RR120) removal capacity of a novel bio-based adsorbent developed by combining an effective catalyst and naturally available fungal wastes at the batch scale level. For this purpose, morphological and molecular identification of the fungal species collected from nature was determined. Later, the dried waste biomass of the fungal species and MCM-41 were combined in different ratios to produce a bio-based adsorbent (bioadsorbent). The effects of pH, the initial dye concentration, bioadsorbent composition, bioadsorbent amount, and the contact time on RR120 removal by the new bioadsorbent were determined and optimized using artificial neural network (ANN) modeling. According to the results of this study, the optimal conditions for dye biosorption were determined.

Thus, a multi-objective optimal operation model was developed to optimize the operation scheme and reduce the energy consumption of the tidal pumping station. In the model, a day is divided into several sub-periods according to the regulation of water level in tidal reach. The partition of sub-periods, the number and blade angle of operating units in each sub-period are adjusted to minimize daily operation energy consumption.

Wastewater treatment is energy intensive and is often named specifically in emissions and energy reduction discussions. Electrolytic hydrogen production creates by-product oxygen which can improve the efficiency and performance of the wastewater treatment process during the aeration stage. This study analyses a co-located wastewater treatment plant and hydrogen facility and evaluates the techno-economic feasibility of the combination. The analysis is conducted as a case study of Northern Ireland Water's wastewater treatment network by applying an uplift model for enriched oxygen in wastewater treatment plants using industry standard performance parameters. The wastewater treatment network used 93.33 GWh of electrical energy in 2019, accounting for 1.21% of total regional usage. Whole-network analysis of the treatment plants under a hub-and-spoke oxygen distribution model showed a tension between locating for maximal network benefit and locating for optimal on-site benefit. Concentrated oxygen injection could significantly increase the efficiency and throughput of the water treatment process, but this study shows that the sum value of tangible and intangible benefits is expected to be less than 1% of the market value of the oxygen required. It is concluded that by-product oxygen could provide the necessary concentrated oxygen instead, either viewed as acting to subsidise the cost of hydrogen production or as an energy-recovery method that returns on the order of 0.5%–2% of the energy required to produce hydrogen.";"2023-10-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623026264";"1";"Water Refinement"

Herein, the present work proposed an enhanced shock-loading-tolerance strategy for AGS by applying a weak magnetic field (WMF). Results indicated that aerobic granules exposed in WMF kept a significant propagation regardless of the various influent organic concentrations, while those in the control reactor exhibited inadaptability with decreasing biomass concentration and bioactivity at lean substrate conditions. The enhanced extracellular polymeric substances regulating process might be one of the inducement mechanisms to cope with organic shock loadings of WMF. In addition, the AGS system in WMF showed its strong resilience in terms of the ammonia and phosphate removal. Magnetic field could inhibit the overgrowth of filamentous bacteria, and the enhanced tolerance for organic shock loadings might attribute to the enrichment of functional microbes related to structural stability such as Firmicutes and Candidatus_Competibacter.

The model is useful for the selection of the best destination for the sludge generated in treatment plants based on the various changes that a decision can have throughout the operation of the sanitation system. The applicability of the proposed model was tested in a case study of WTPs 3 and 4 and the Anhumas Wastewater Treatment Plant located in Campinas, the main city of the Piracicaba, Capivari and Jundiaí river basin, an important area of water resource management in Brazil. The developed model can be used by treatment plants to: select the best final destination option according to treatment technologies; select the best location for final disposal, considering transport, disposal and storage costs; verify the influence on treatment costs to adapt to a pre-defined final destination for joint management; or compare beneficial disposal costs with landfill disposal costs. The model was developed to allow for gradual increase in acceptance of the residue over time. By establishing this variable, slightly lower final costs were observed in the scenario of sending the sludge with aluminum coagulant to ceramic industries, compared to sending it to landfill, in the case study used for model development. Despite the interesting results, these values should be considered only indicative. Therefore, it can be stated that the major challenge to using the SD model is the accurate and appropriate data collection for correct simulation, as well as its historical series, for accurate evaluation of the viability of the model. The proposed simulation methods showed greater sensitivity to treatment costs, highlighting the importance of beneficial use of the proposed sludge to the technologies employed for water and sludge treatment.

However, the effect of PFA on wastewater microbial community changes as well as the differences in comparison to the commonly disinfectants used are poorly documented. We provide an overview of the PFA effect and that of chlorine and UV, two commonly used disinfectants, on microbial community diversity and structure. The study was performed using wastewaters from three municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) processed by activated sludge, lagoon and reed beds, and biofilter. We focused on disinfection of pathogen microorganisms, identifying sensitive and resistant bacteria to disinfectants that can serve as biomarkers for evaluating the disinfectant performances. As well, we investigated the modifications of microbial functions after treatment by functional predictive analysis. The more efficient E. coli inactivation was obtained with initial concentration of 4 mg/L of PFA with 15 min disinfectant contact time that achieved 95.71–99.99% inactivation efficiency. Although the origin of wastewater was the main factor determining the microbial community diversity and composition, the microbial communities were specific to the disinfectant used. Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) identified 18 and 10 biomarkers, including pathogenic microorganisms affiliated to Chromobacterium, Flavobacterium, Aeromonas, Enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia_Shigella and Fusobacteriaceae, which were sensitive to PFA, while being resistant to chlorine and/or UV. Consistently, the predicted bacterial functional patterns diverged according to the wastewater origin and the disinfectant used.

However, designing a green and low-cost non-metallic catalyst to activate persulfate (PS) for removal of hazardous organic contaminants via non-radical-dominated processes is still challenging. Herein, porous hydrochar (PHC) was synthesized with agricultural waste of corn straw (CS) as precursor and KHCO3 as pore-forming agent, which contained mesoporous structures with defects, thus facilitating phenol adsorption (117.14 mg/g). Moreover, 20 mg/L of phenol could achieve 100% removal at a wide pH range (7.0–11.0) within 10 min by PHC/PS system. The radical pathways induced by O · H and O 2 · − had certain effect on phenol removal, while non-radical pathways ( 1 O 2 and electron transfer process) played dominant contributions. Among them, 1 O 2 was produced from the reaction between surface functional groups on PHC and PS, and electron transfer process occurred from phenol to PS via PHC as the conductor. Whether under the interference of co-existing substances or in different water matrixes, the degradation efficiency of phenol could reach above 80%, exhibiting the excellent adaptability of PHC/PS system.

Hence, providing an effective treatment approach to reduce the total cost and duration of the wastewater treatment process is crucial. Although the adsorption and photocatalysis methods show superb potential for removing hazardous pollutants from water, their combination through a suitable synthesis route is one of the most effective ways to overcome their limitations. Activated carbon (AC) significantly accelerates the rate of pollutant degradation for AC-based photocatalysts compared to bare photocatalysts because of its ability to increase the number of attachment sites, strengthen the interaction between pollutants and photocatalysts, and facilitate rapid electron transfer to prevent electron or hole recombination. This study aims to investigate four main objectives: 1) evaluating key parameters to enhance the surface characterization of AC-derived from lignocellulosic sources using physical and chemical techniques; 2) Surveying various approaches for synthesizing AC-based photocatalysts; 3) explaining the mechanism of photocatalytic degradation of pollutants and the operating parameters in the wastewater treatment process; and 4) providing an overview of the opportunities, challenges, suggestions, and potential future outlooks. Future studies should focus on understanding the structural properties of AC to design effective photocatalytic systems for degrading hazardous contaminants.

The GBC particle electrodes demonstrated better electrochemical reaction activity than biochar (BC) particle electrodes. The GBC three-dimensional electrochemical reactor achieved 99.48% removal of tetracycline (5 mg/L) under an input voltage of 10 V. The electrochemical oxidation performance of GBC electrode system was competitive to some metal/metal oxides or metal/carbon material electrode system reported. The removal efficiency of tetracycline was less sensitive to the initial pH of solution from 3.0 to 11.0. The GBC electrode had higher oxygen evolution potential (OEP) (1.76 V), and lower Tafel slope (0.013 V dec−1) than that of the BC. Coated graphene improved electrical conductivity to prompt electron aggregation on surface of the biochar resulting in more reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation.

Photoelectrochemical systems have emerged as an alternative for the decentralized management of domestic wastewater with the potential of recovering energy while degrading pollutants such as urea. Tungsten oxide (WO3) has been traditionally used for water splitting, but the use of this material for the removal of waste from water coupled to hydrogen production is not deeply known until now. This contribution shows an exhaustive and systematic investigation on WO3 photoanodes for the photoelectrochemical oxidation of urea and the generation of hydrogen, with insights on the reaction mechanism, detailed nitrogen balance investigation of the process, and analysis of the performance compared to well-accepted materials. The WO3 platelets were successfully synthesized in situ on fluorine doped tin oxide glass by a hydrothermal method. The performance of WO3 was compared to titanium dioxide (TiO2) as a benchmark. The photocurrent was enhanced for both electrodes when urea was added to the electrolyte, with WO3 showing one order of magnitude higher photocurrent than TiO2. The WO3 electrode showed a peak incident photon-to-current efficiency of 43% at 360 nm and a much greater rate constant for urea oxidation (1.47 × 10−2 min−1), compared to the TiO2 photoanode (16% at 340 nm and 1.1 × 10−3 min−1). The influence of different reactor configurations was also evaluated testing one- and two-compartment back-face irradiated photoelectrochemical cells.

In this research, a novel type of water purification membrane was fabricated using a nylon 6 nanofiber membrane as a base polymer and further mechanical processing. The electrospun nylon 6 membrane was first semi-dissolved by spraying diluted formic acid solvent, then re-casted by thermal rolling, and a very-tight ultrafiltration membrane named SP6 was obtained. Fabricated SP6 had an ultrathin thickness of 9 μm and ultimately high mechanical strength (53 MPa). Owing to the enhanced hydrophilicity and ultra-low thickness, a 59 ± 7 LMH water flux was observed for SP6. Furthermore, SP6 showed 98 ± 0.85% humic acid (H.A) and 92.13 ± 0.46% organic dye rejection.

The reduction of energy consumption and the improvement of effluent quality to meet more stringent discharge limits pose significant challenges for wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). Most of the energy consumption in WWTPs is attributed to aeration, especially in secondary treatment processes where microorganisms rely on a significant supply of oxygen to sustain their life activities and degrade pollutants. This paper reviews the common secondary treatment processes (oxygen ditch, biological aerated filter, sequential batch reactor, membrane bioreactor) and their energy consumption, and examines the energy consumption and efficiency of aeration in WWTPs in different countries and regions. To address the high energy consumption of aeration, methods for energy saving and consumption reduction are discussed from three aspects: aerator design, mass transfer enhancement, and aeration control strategies. The aerator assumes a pivotal function in determining the characteristics of gas-liquid distribution characteristics in the reactor, which then affects the mass transfer. Mass transfer enhancement in the reactor can improve the oxygen transport efficiency between gas, liquid, and activated sludge. Based on the actual operation conditions, aeration control strategies can adjust the aeration rate to provide accurate air supply and achieving dissolved oxygen (DO) control, thereby reducing the high energy consumption caused by excess aeration. Finally, this study proposes research directions for optimizing the aeration process in WWTPs, including investigating the mechanism of DO transfer to microorganisms, exploring novel oxygen supply modes, and improving energy management of plant-wide consumption to enhance the plant's energy self-sufficiency. Future WWTPs should be low-energy, high-efficiency, intelligent, and environmentally friendly to address the energy shortages and accommodate the large-scale development and unmanned operation of WWTPs.

For this purpose, this study, jointly performed by a research university and a large pharma company, evaluated the use of Hollow fiber membrane contactors (HFMC). The experiments were conducted using real pharmaceutical wastewater in two separate laboratories at two process scales (bench and pilot) and two operating modes (batch and continuous). The study evaluated the effect of feed concentration, flow rate, and process configuration and described the results using a single-parameter (mass transfer coefficient K) mathematical model. We then used the model to design scaled-up batch and continuous processes, based on which we performed a detailed economic assessment. A robust and consistent ammonia removal and recovery were obtained for all the experimental conditions tested. The model adequately described the empirical results, and K was similar across all the experiments in this study, which were conducted in practically relevant conditions. Both batch and continuous process designs were found feasible, increasing process flexibility. The economic evaluation revealed that acid and base consumption, rather than the initial investment, is the most significant expense. The cost of membranes, although relatively high, had little contribution to the overall expenses. Revenues from selling the recovered nitrogen as ammonium-sulfate fertilizer reduces the evaluated net cost of the novel treatment to a minimum of $3.76 per kgN - a potential cost savings of up to 29% relative to the current treatment ($5.28).

In this study, the modified intermediate blocking model was applied to fit the data from literature about RO pretreatment, getting good fitting performance, over 86% of the determination coefficient (R2) exceeding 0.90. The working law of RO pretreatment on model parameters (final permeate flux (Jpss) and fouling velocity (k)) was systematically studied. The result showed that pretreatment works by three pathways: enhancing Jpss and reducing k, reducing both k and Jpss, and increasing both k and Jpss; it exerts more of an effect by improving k rather than Jpss. Furthermore, ultrafiltration exhibits a 10% higher effect on Jpss compared to ozonation while its effect on k is about 20% better than that of ozonation. Additionally, ultrafiltration demonstrates greater stability than ozonation.

For evaluating the developed index, its temporal and spatial distribution is studied and compared to those of some other indices, such as Standardized Salinity Index (SSI), Standardized Groundwater Index (SGI), and Standardized Water level Index (SWI). The proposed index is applied for the temporal and spatial evaluation of the quantity and quality of groundwater in theLake Urmia basin, having 1084 piezometric and 935 groundwater quality monitoring wells. For a more comprehensive analysis of drought, 24 marginal and 26 joint probability distribution functions are driven. Based on the results, the developed GQQI is correlated with drought indices of SSI, SGI, and SWI by 88%, 86%, and 61%, respectively. Moreover, the values of the developed drought index indicates the occurrence of more severe droughts, compared to those detected by other drought indices. This can be resulted from considering the combined effects of groundwater quantity and quality using the proposed index. In addition, the multivariate GQQI can spatially and temporally represent the drought severity over the basin, and identify severe and extreme drought conditions better than other univariate drought indices.

The biofilm formation potential of pipes made from polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and ductile iron (DI) coated with different layers, namely, cement and epoxy, were investigated. The results showed a significantly higher biomass formation potential for cement-coated DI than other materials, while the PVC materials manufactured by the same company for different purposes were not significantly different in this regard. Furthermore, the results of biomass formation potential were compared with other national standards and showed that the selected materials, including epoxy- and cement-coated DI, and two out of five PVC materials were unsuitable for use in water distribution systems. In this study, stabilizers used for PVC pipes were also prepared in the form of coupons and tested to observe their biomass formation potential. The obtained results provide a basis for selecting stabilizers in drinking water pipe production to ensure biostability of the materials.

This process couples photoanodic oxidation with in-situ generated H2O2 (PEC/E-H2O2) and was used for the inactivation of Escherichia coli (E. coli) under simulated solar conditions. In a low-concentration 5 mM Na2SO4 electrolyte, the PEC/E-H2O2 process consumed only 2.14 KJ/L-log of energy and eliminated 106 CFU/mL of E. coli within 50 min. The 0.61 mM H2O2 in-situ generated enhanced the oxidation of the photoelectrochemical system due to the formation of •OH. Compared with traditional electrochemically generated H2O2 (E-H2O2) and photoelectrochemical (PEC) processes, the specific rate constant of E. coli inactivated by the PEC/E-H2O2 process increased by 2.19 and 2.11 times, respectively. The mechanism and the contribution of active species to the process were investigated through a series of competition experiments, fluorescence probes, and EPR measurements. It was verified that the generated radicals, especially h+, •OH, and •O2 −, played a significant role in bacterial inactivation. Additionally, the electron transfer mechanism of the PEC/E-H2O2 system and the possible inactivation mechanism of E. coli were proposed. SEM comparisons, potassium ion leakage, and the β-GAL activity decreasing of targeted cells indicated the destruction of the inner and outer cellular membranes, thus causing the inactivation of E. coli.

By utilizing the Reform of Political Performance Assessment Standards in China as a quasi-natural experiment, the results reveal that political promotion incentives significantly reduce wastewater discharge by border firms, resulting in a substantial reduction of 7.1% and a cost-saving of 23,487.7 million yuan for society. The improvement in border pollution can be attributed to the fact that border firms, by increasing investments in wastewater discharge facilities, manage to achieve a less pronounced increase in wastewater discharge compared to their production scale. The effectiveness of emission reduction in border pollution is more prominent in the subsample of non-politically connected, high-pollution industries, as well as in political rotation nodes.

Therefore, in this work, the removal of fluoride from TSW by aluminum ions was studied. Electrocoagulation (EC) is essentially the use of aluminum ions to remove fluoride. The EC technology is widely favored by researchers due to its advantages of high treatment efficiency, simple operation, and easy automatic control. However, in the current research, EC technology as a deep defluorination method is mostly in the laboratory research stage, and there are few pilot test studies on large processing capacity, which slows down the industrial application of this technology to a certain extent. In this work, laboratory tests were carried out to study the removal of fluoride in wastewater by chemical coagulation and EC in detail. On this basis, the combined process of chemical coagulation pretreatment and EC advanced treatment was used to treat TSW with a capacity of 250–500 L/h. The results show that the coexisting ions in TSW have no effect on the defluorination of aluminum ions, and the optimal defluorination final pH of chemical coagulation and EC is 6–7. The pilot test could stably reduce the concentration of fluoride in TSW from 66 to 128 mg/L to less than 10 mg/L, and the total operating cost was 0.99–1.51 USD/m3 of wastewater. Cost analysis showed that the three items with the highest proportions in the chemical coagulation pretreatment costs were liquid caustic soda fee, aluminum sulfate fee, and solid waste treatment fee; while the three items with the highest proportions in the EC advanced treatment costs were aluminum plate loss fee, electricity fee, and solid waste treatment fee. This study is helpful to promote the application of EC advanced treatment technology in the defluorination of industrial wastewater.

In practical application, however, MnO2 suffers from low redox activity owing to deprotonation, while biochar is subject to limited removal capacity. Herein, a difunctional engineering sulfuric acid-pretreated biochar supporting MnO2 composite (MBC-A) was firstly synthesized and optimized to remove various TOPs from aqueous solution. Specifically, sulfuric acid not only served as an active agent to improve the specific surface area of biochar for improvement of adsorption capacity and more MnO2 loading, but also facilitated the introduction of sulfonic acid groups (-SO3H) as an internal proton reservoir to inhibit inactivation of MnO2 due to deprotonation in alkaline. Thanks to adsorption and oxidation, MBC-A showed excellent removal capacity (214.9 mg/g) and fast reaction kinetics (360 min) for tetracycline (TC), exceeding precursor and other materials reported in literature. Importantly, the effective operation pH range of MBC-A was broadened to 1–13 with the help of buffering capacity of –SO3H groups. The dominant driving force of adsorption were π-π interaction and hydrogen bond; while reactive oxidative species were mainly ascribed to singlet oxygen (1O2), hydroxyl radical (·OH) and reactive Mn3+. The possible reactive sites and pathway were investigated by combining experimental results with density functional theory (DFT) calculation. Further, the results of multiple cyclic runs, removal in real river water and toxicity assessment demonstrated well reusability, high environmental security, and excellent practical applicability of MBC-A.

Due to the complexity of microbial communities, imbalances between the different types of bacteria may occur and disturb the process, with pronounced economical and environmental consequences. Microscopic inspection of the morphology of flocs and microorganisms provides key information on AS properties and function. This is a time-consuming, highly skilled, and expensive process that is not readily available in all locations. Thus, most wastewater-treatment plants do not carry out this essential analysis, resulting in frequent operational faults. In this study, we develop a novel deep learning (DL) object detection algorithm to analyze and monitor the AS process based on a unique microscopic image database of flocs and microorganisms. Specifically, we applied YOLOv5 and Faster R-CNN algorithms as tools for segmentation and object detection to analyze the wastewater. The mean average precision (mAP) of the YOLOv5 was 0.67, outperforming the Faster R-CNN by 15%. Histogram equalization preprocessing of both bright-field and phase-contrast images significantly improved the results of the algorithm in all classes. In the case of YOLOv5, the mAP increased by 16.67%, to 0.77, where the AP of protozoa, filaments, and open floc classes outperformed the previous model by over 20%.

Based on OWA's six guiding principles, five interventions (i.e., control factors) and sixteen parameters have been identified. Each parameter is simulated twice by running 10,000 iterations to calculate a percentage reduction of potable water use at 90th, 50th, and 10th percentiles.

For coastal regions, the addition of seawater desalination as an alternative water source can hedge against uncertainty stemming from demands placed on the system and hydrological inputs to the natural resources. In order to effectively integrate desalination into a water supply system, water managers utilize optimization models that solve for the optimal mix of desalination and natural resources to meet consumer demands at a sufficient water quality while maintaining sustainable levels in the natural resources. The complexity of managing both quantity and quality for a water supply system facing uncertainties is increased by contractual limitations between desalination plant owners and water managers that dictate the desalination production decisions to occur at the start of the year before the uncertainties have been revealed. To incorporate the misalignment between decision timelines and the order in which the uncertainty is revealed, a two-stage optimization approach is utilized where management decisions are split into implementable decisions representing the desalination production volumes, and recourse decisions representing supply volumes from the remaining sources and water allocations in the supply network. An iterative process is then undertaken in which in the first stage the implementable decisions are solved for potential uncertain scenarios, and then introduced to the second stage as inputs where the recourse decisions are iteratively solved for new uncertain scenarios. This framework is applied to the Israeli national water supply system, where the unique challenges of managing mixed salinity sources and asynchronous decision timelines in the face of uncertainty are addressed. A multicriteria decision analysis method is then applied where tradeoffs are found between the upfront investment in desalination and the expected system operational cost and robustness to failure.

The key influencing factors of WRSE are analyzed through the obstacle degree model. The findings indicate that: a) the WRSEI in the Yangtze River to Huaihe River Water Transfer Project (YHWTP) area showed a gradual increase from 0.641 in 2011 to 0.662 in 2020; b) the WRSE level of each criterion layer attained a general equilibrium or fair equilibrium state, and the WRSE state shows a trend from dispersion to aggregation during 2011 and 2020; c) per capita water resources, per capita gross domestic product and per capita urban wastewater discharge are the main factors limiting the realization of a benign WRSE in the YHWTP, with the obstacle degrees reaching 0.347, 0.324 and 0.326 in 2020 respectively. This framework can provide a theoretical reference for the study of WRSE, and provide a scientific basis and suggestions for policymakers to enhance WRSE and achieve sustainable utilization of water resources.

The effect of polyaluminium chloride (PACl) dosage on membrane fouling control and methane potential of preconcentrated domestic sewage was also investigated. Membrane fouling control was realized by the increase of particle-size (6.03%–40.65%) and the decline of soluble microbial product (11.10%–33.14%) with the rise of PACl addition. The minimum membrane filtration resistance of 1.15 × 1013 m−1 was obtained at the group with 10 mg/L PACl, which was 7.96%–28.20% lower than other groups. More than 75% of chemical oxygen demand (COD) could be preconcentrated, and the preconcentrated ratio increased by 4.22%–9.70% with the rise of PACl addition. Methane potential decreased by 5.40%–40.56% due to the inhibition of accumulated PACl. The pre-hydrolysis of domestic sewage during AnMPC could shorten fermentation time by 0.8–3.2 d. The group with 10 mg/L PACl addition was the optimal due to the excellent anti-fouling performance and the promising energy balance. This study could provide a promising membrane-based preconcentration method with high COD recovery and mild membrane fouling for sustainable treatment of domestic sewage.

Inorganic-organic hybrid metal chalcogenides should have great potentials as photocatalysts for Cr(VI) reduction due to their rich structural characteristics. Herein, an inorganic-organic hybrid indium tin selenide (Bmmim)8In8Sn8Se30(Se4)2 (BITS), featuring a two-dimensional layered structure, was synthesized through an ionothermal method. Owing to the unique layered structure, BITS can exhibit an outstanding photocatalytic performance for reducing Cr(VI) under visible light irradiation, where its Cr(VI) reduction rate was 26.3, 11.8, and 7.8 times higher than that of P25, In2Se3 nanoparticles, and SnSe2 nanosheets, respectively. Meanwhile, BITS showed a strong anti-interference ability to a variety of anions and cations, and accordingly, maintained its excellent photocatalytic performance in three water bodies, including tap water, lake water, and river water. In addition, BITS can also display a high efficiency for Cr(VI) reduction under sunlight irradiation. Photocatalytic mechanism investigation proved the key role of electrons to the Cr(VI) reduction.

The novel terpolymers endow the membranes with amphiphilic and pH-responsive performances. Compared with the blend membrane, the copolymer had the more stable covalent bonding, and then its hydrophilic segments could anchor and enrich stably to the membrane surface without diffusing into the aqueous phase.

Existing data-driven operation rule extraction models are influenced by both features and hyperparameters, and lack subjective-objective coordination, hindering the formulation of reasonable water energy utilization strategies. To improve the comprehensive benefits of cascade reservoirs, this study proposes a novel multi-objective cascade reservoir operation rule derivation framework. First, a multi-objective optimal operation model for cascade reservoirs (MOOMCR) considering power generation, environment, and navigation is constructed and solved using a Speed-constrained Multi-objective Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (SMPSO). The relationships among the requirements were explained using a four-dimensional Pareto front visualization analysis. Then, an Integrated Decision-making Method based on Multilevel Subspace Domination (IDMSD) is proposed to circumvent the subjective defects of single decision-making models and reliably select the optimal scheme with the most significant comprehensive benefits from all typical years. Finally, a feature-hyperparameter combination optimization technique based on the differential evolutionary algorithm (FHCC-DE/best/1) is proposed, which exhibits its strength in the identification of key influencing factors on the optimal discharge flow from the IDMSD. The method was embedded in a deep learning model to construct a Combinatorial Evolution Network (CEN) to extract the implicit reservoir operation rules from the optimal IDMSD schemes for the MOOMCR. The results show that the RMSE of the CEN simulating the optimal discharge flow is improved by 5.98%, 28.03%, and 27.89% for the XLD reservoir and by 11.01%, 1.66%, and 60.98% for the XJB reservoir, respectively, over the best results of all benchmark models.

Yet, some current studies focus on considering local drivers based on statistical methods, which may ignore the impacts of drivers in associated regions such as upstream-downstream, and consequently lead to deviation in attribution analysis and management of variations in local ES. To overcome this challenge, this study proposes an attribution analysis method of changes in ecosystem services based on emergy and partial differentiation equation (PDE), and applies it at River Basin scale to quantitively measure cross-regional causation. Taking the Yellow River Basin (YRB), China, as a case, this study identifies and assesses the specific contribution of drivers to the variations in ES from 2000 to 2020. The results show that the ES in the entire YRB increased 30%, and the ES in the upper, middle and lower reaches increased 30%, 36% and 3% respectively. All the assessed ecosystem services increased in the past two decades, among which three services including air purification (182%), climate regulation (145%) and water purification (79%) have the largest increase ratio. Natural drivers R (such as evapotranspiration, precipitation, etc.), human drivers S (land use change), significance driver τ (the significance degree of human attention to ES improvement) commonly and disproportionately drive the ES dynamics. The contribution ratios of the three above drivers to the increase in ES are 0.7:8:1, 1:9:0.8, 0.2:7:1.6 and (−7):11:4 for the entire basin, the upper, middle and lower reaches respectively.

However, the lack of data about the comparison with consolidated technologies, including also the evaluation of their impact on the environment, has contributed to humper their application at full scale so far. In this study, the environmental impact of a new S-AOP, namely sequential treatment (ST) with sunlight/H2O2 and solar photo-Fenton (SPF) at neutral pH (using Ethylenediamine-N, N′-disuccinic acid (EDDS) as chelating agent) operated at pilot scale in a raceway pond reactor, was compared to a pilot scale ozonation (O3) treatment unit in terms of simultaneous bacteria inactivation and CECs removal, through a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Different urban wastewater treatment plant (UWWTP) sizes and scenarios (namely effluent disposal and reuse) were evaluated. While the reuse scenario resulted in a higher impact compared to the disposal scenario in the construction/deconstruction phase, due to the more stringent limits that resulted in longer treatment time and a higher consumption of raw materials, the positive impact on water resources saving compared to disposal makes the reuse scenario a more sustainable solution. Despite O3 disinfection by-products were taken into account, ST resulted in a higher toxicity to human health (0.27·10−9 DALYs Vs 2.11 10−9 DALYs, respectively) due to the higher residual concentration of the target CECs. However, it is noteworthy that both values are significantly lower than the acceptable DALYs value (≤10−6).

But the massive and continuously increasing consumption of hazardous chemicals, especially carcinogenic dyes such as methylene blue, methyl orange, malachite green, etc., at the domestic and industrial level has led to the lack of potable water sources and ecological problems. It will seriously affect human civilization, sustainable & long-term global development, and the marine environment. Therefore, researchers have focused on more advanced techniques than conventional wastewater treatment methods for the removal/degradation of toxic dyes to address the aforementioned problem. In this study, we have explored the efficient, safe, clean and cost-effective approach for degradation of toxic dyes from wastewater i.e., photocatalytic treatment of dye contaminated wastewater using biomass-derived carbon dots. The green synthesized carbon-dots-based photocatalysts for dye-wastewater treatment have many advantages over conventional methods, such as they are inexpensive, non-toxic, require basic ingredients, exhibit quick reactions, involve easy procedures and straightforward post-processing steps. Hence, this study offers a resource for preserving both human health and the marine environment. The understanding of photocatalytic degradation of dye-contaminated wastewater will also set the stage for future wastewater treatment research. Therefore, the current review provides an overview of recent researches regarding photocatalytic wastewater treatment, respective challenges and future perspectives.

To achieve those purposes, we have designed and fabricated an S-scheme catalyst by in-situ growing magnetic sodium ferric silicate/ferroferric oxide-ferric oxide (SFS/M-FO) heterojunction. Our results demonstrated the mechanism of heterogeneous interface formation and S-scheme charge transportation between NaFeSi2O6 and α-Fe2O3 in the composite. Meanwhile, the semi-coherent interface in heterojunction could effectively reduce the charge transfer resistance. The incorporation of magnetic ferroferric oxide (Fe3O4) not only ensured high recoverability of the catalyst, but also facilitated charge transfer and improved light absorption capacity. The improved catalytic activity was derived from the combination of the S-scheme NaFeSi2O6/α-Fe2O3 heterojunction and Fe3O4 electronic conductor.

The effects of high-silicon-phosphorus tailings addition, sintering temperature and soaking time on the properties of porous ceramsite were studied, also the mechanism of heavy metal solidification and Ag+ adsorption from sewage were revealed. The results indicated that the porous ceramsite exhibited excellent comprehensive properties after sintered at 1085 °C for 1.5 h, whose apparent porosity was 47.3%, bulk density was 1.53 g/cm3, compressive strength was 2.85 MPa, water adsorption was 27.05% and hydrochloric acid solubility was 8.5%. Furthermore, the preparation of porous ceramsite contributed to the solidification of heavy metals in phosphorous tailing due to the formation of liquid phase during the sintering. The leaching concentration of heavy metals within porous ceramsite was much lower than that in phosphorus tailings, which were far below the standard (GB 8978-1996). In addition, the numerous micropores formed by the decomposition of phosphorus tailings endowed the porous ceramsite with excellent adsorption ability.

To clarify the water adsorption and releasing performance of thermo-responsive polymers and further propose the potential research of the application in energy field, this paper reviews the existed research for three aspects: synthesis, water adsorption/desorption kinetics and application. Firstly, the grafting of thermo-responsive polymers on traditional materials and modification of thermo-responsive polymers for improving the adsorption/desorption performance is concluded.

Through the literature review, it can be generalized that the thermo-responsive polymer-based adsorbents have high water adsorption capacity and low regeneration temperature requirement, becoming a potential adsorbent for dehumidification and water harvesting. For the water adsorption and desorption, the temperature related heat and mass transfer kinetics requires further research, especially the thermodynamic model.

Recently, solar energy has been used to purify wastewater by combing photothermal materials with variety of membranes. This is because of photothermal materials can absorb sunlight and convert solar energy into thermal energy efficiently. Currently, photothermal membranes for water desalination have gradually become the focus of research. However, the application of photothermal membranes for oily wastewater treatment are not sufficient. This review paper first introduces the light absorption and solar-thermal conversion mechanism of various photothermal materials, which provides theoretical bases for the selection and designing of photothermal materials. Then the latest progress of photothermal materials in desalination, water purification, and oil leakage treatment is reviewed. In addition, some research progress in the pollution control of photothermal materials in water treatment is introduced. Then the challenges which were existed in the photothermal material applications were summarized. Currently, some materials have achieved high photothermal conversion efficiency, due to expensive materials or complex processes, the cost is too high for large-scale practical promotion, resulting in a large gap between the test and practical application. Therefore, the future development of photothermal films needs to reduce the cost and ensure their performance. Besides, most of the experiments are carried out in a simulated environment, such as simulated sunlight. The actual environment is affected by a variety of factors, such as weather changes and many complex conditions existing in the water environment. Whether the photothermal film can also produce the desired effect under natural conditions remains to be tested. In addition, photothermal membranes have great advantages in water treatment, but their impact on the environment and health is rarely mentioned in the literature. Therefore, we need to carry out environmental and health risk assessments of photothermal membranes and minimize the harmful effects of photothermal films on the environment and health. It is believed that with the deepening of research, photothermal materials show attractive potential as green technology for proactively wastewater treatment in the near future.

The sustained-release ball contained Fe3+ prepared by polymer encapsulation was added to the anodic chamber of bioelectro-Fenton, in which sustained-release Fe3+ was reduced to Fe2+ by microorganism and then transferred to the cathodic chamber through exchange membrane to catalyze the in-situ generated H2O2. The Fe3+ release could be adjusted by the pore-forming agent with an optimal content of 15 wt%. Compared to the case without pore-forming agent (i.e., 0 wt%), the generated •OH, power generation and tetracycline removal (90.2 ± 0.6%, increased by 19.5%) were all significantly improved. The cathodic Fe2+ was maintained among 0.65–0.87 mg L−1, which significantly increased the cathodic Fe2+/total iron proportion (82.4–84.7%), and thus promoted the Fe2+ cycle and the bioelectro-Fenton efficiency. The content of the microbial electron transport enzymes was found to increase >1.18 times, possessing higher and more active microbial process for stable Fe2+ production and iron cycle. The tetracycline removal in river background confirmed that it was suitable for treating antibiotics in natural water background.

Water resources carrying capacity (WRCC), as an important measurement, plays a vital role in guiding regional water resources management and sustainable utilization. Existing studies on WRCC are abundant, but in-depth studies on the multidimensional evolution of WRCC and its driving mechanism are still lacking. Therefore, taking Guangdong (GD) Province as a case, this study is aimed to propose a systematical WRCC research framework and attempts to explore the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of regional WRCC and reveal its evolutionary driving mechanisms. First, a simplified and effective WRCC index system is constructed through the correlation and contribution rate analysis to remove redundant information. Then, a coupled model consisting of an improved technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) and grey relational analysis model is proposed to accurately evaluate WRCC.

This study investigated the biofilm formation and chlorine resistance of multi-species biofilms in two representative outdoor pipe materials (polyethylene (PE) and cast iron pipe). The results showed that cast iron pipes have higher biofilm biomass but lower biofilm activity than PE pipes. The different growth environments of the two pipe materials resulted in diverse microbial community-intrinsic properties and affected multi-species biofilm formation. The microbial communities without Sphingomonas or Acidovorax in cast iron pipe exhibited higher biofilm biomass, when compared with those in PE pipe. In contrast, the microbial community without Bacillus in PE pipe presented higher biofilm biomass, when compared with those in cast iron pipe. Extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) and corrosion products protected bacteria from chlorination. Although community-intrinsic properties helped bacteria resist chlorination, the same microbial community exhibited diverse chlorine resistance in different pipe materials owing to different community-intrinsic properties. While the chlorine resistance of microbial community without Bacillus was low in PE pipe, that in cast iron pipe was better owing to high corrosion degree. Multi-species biofilm without Sphingomonas or Acidovorax presented higher biofilm biomass, but lower EPS content and corrosion products in cast iron pipe, resulting in low chlorine resistance. In summary, this study revealed that outdoor pipe materials could affect microbial community-intrinsic properties, which in turn could influence biofilm characteristics, and provided unique insights for ensuring drinking water safety.

To explore the strengthening mechanism of the CWs, three comparative experiments, including Co CWs (electro-conductive materials coke as filler), Co-P CWs (coke as filler with pickerel weed (Pontederia cordata L)), and QS-P CWs (quartz sand as filler with pickerel weed (Pontederia cordata L)), were tested to investigate the influence of the clogging process on the purification capacity from the electrochemical characteristics and the community of microorganisms in domestic sewage. The results showed that coke, as an electro-conductive filler, had the best organic removal and high electric output, even with solid particle accumulation. Co-P CWs were the most stable and had the best removal efficiency of COD (chemical oxygen demand) in urban sewage, with an average removal rate of 74.9% at 7 weeks, which was 14 and 7.3% higher than those of the QS-P CWs and Co CWs, respectively. The power generation performance of the Co-P CWs was also the best. During operation, the voltage remained the highest (377.9–222.0 MV). The microbial community diversity, richness, and utilization rate of the six categories of carbon sources of Co-P CWs were the highest, with the dominant genera being organic matter aerobic degrading bacteria, electrochemically active bacteria, and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. The microbial richness in coke CWs exhibited high microbial activity in the entire bed, not only at the inlet. This indicates that the system transfers electrons to the conductive material by relying on the metabolism of microorganisms; electrons generated at the bottom of the bed are directly transmitted to the bed surface through the conductive material, resulting in a uniform distribution of electrons throughout the bed and high microbial activity.

The effectiveness for removal of malathion, a typical organophosphorus pesticide from water were comparatively examined by the prepared adsorbents. The impacts of the pyrolysis temperature on performance of the biochar and adsorption behavior of malathion on the modified biochar were systematically studied by surface analysis, removal efficiency tests under different solution conditions, as well as data simulations. The adsorption mechanisms and reusability of the modified biochar were also investigated and experimented, respectively. The results indicated that the WHCBC–600 had a larger specific surface area and pore volume than the WHCBC–400, while WHCBC–400 had a greater polarity and hydrophilicity. Both of the two prepared biochars followed pseudo–second–order kinetics and their adsorption isotherms conformed to the Sips model. The maximum adsorption capacities of WHCBC–400 and WHCBC–600 were 128 mg/g and 32.7 mg/g, respectively. It was found that the adsorption of malathion by the biochars were dominated by chemisorption. Diffusion at the liquid film was the rate–limiting step in the adsorption process. The difference in the form of the calcium loadings, polarity of biochar, and the rate–limiting step of adsorption were important factors affecting the adsorption capacity of the biochar. In comparison, the specific surface area and pore volume of the prepared absorbents had less significant effects on the adsorption capacity. The main adsorption mechanism of the two modified biochars was surface complexation. In addition, the solution pH and coexisting material had little effect on the adsorption of malathion by WHCBC–400 and WHCBC–600. Both of the modified biochar had good regeneration performance.

Despite the strong evidence pointing to the expected benefits of using high-frequency pressure and acoustic sensors to optimise urban water supply, there is limited evidence of their derived applications in real, large-scale smart water networks (SWNs). Through a systematic literature review of case studies in real, operational SWNs equipped with high-frequency pressure and/or acoustic sensors, this study identified best practices, drivers, enablers, and challenges of implementing SWNs, while providing targeted directions for future research. Key applications derived from sensors data included online hydraulic modelling, leak detection and localisation, and proactive asset management, using either, or a combination of, process-based and data-driven models. Reported applications were site-specific and most of them were limited to urban locations in developed countries. Most reported applications used pressure sensors data while applications using acoustic sensors data were limited. Applications based on pressure data included online water demand prediction, water quality control, leak detection, and risk-based asset replacement, while acoustic data were used for precise leak detection and localisation, and early detection of pipeline cracks. Applications were able to support urban water management under field conditions but often had limited applicability (e.g., single leak detection, assumption of uniform pipeline material). A lack of standardisation in case studies regarding the characterisation of the physical infrastructure of the SWN (e.g., number of sensors per pipeline length; water and economic savings) was observed. It is suggested that water managers and researchers should focus on reporting benefits and challenges of developing and implementing high frequency sensors applications in standardized and transferrable ways to enable benchmarking.

Thus, this study focuses on investigating the exergoeconomic performances of the different variants of the copper-chlorine cycle including the three-, four-, and five-step versions. All cycles are modeled and simulated in Aspen-plus software by considering a recovery of thermal energy from industrial waste flue gases in addition to internal heat recovery.

The environmental impact of a novel nutrient recovery technology using a membrane contactor (NPHarvest) was examined with an environmental life cycle assessment (LCA). Impact hotspots were benchmarked against a comparable technology (struvite precipitation and ammonia stripping), and the impacts of the two technologies were found to be similar for most studied environmental impact categories.

The effects on the main line contributed substantially to the overall results.

Processing recycled PET (rPET) into functional materials could achieve both environmental and economic significance. In this work, using rPET and carbon black as raw materials, a low cost 3D seawater evaporator was successfully prepared by electrospinning and folding. By examining the concentration of carbon black (1, 3, 5, 6 wt%) on the photothermal conversion performance of the as-spun films, the optimal concentration 6 wt% was determined. The prepared 6 wt% evaporator showed water evaporation rate about 1.457 kg m−2 h−1 and a conversion efficiency of 93.91% under one solar intensity (1 kW/m2) with good performance stability after 11 cycles for seawater desalination. The desalinated water could meet the WHO and EPA drinking water standards. Meanwhile, the materials cost of the prepared evaporator was about 1.19 USD/m2. Compared to the photothermal conversion efficiency, a photothermal quality factor was calculated, and was 3.81 for the prepared rPET based evaporator, which was higher than most of reported materials. These results suggested the electrospun rPET film might have great potential in seawater desalination and point out a new way to for cleaner reuse of rPET.

The current study focuses on the removal of organics and fecal coliforms which are primary source of pollution in domestic wastewater, using three identical reactors. One vertical planted constructed wetland (R1), one planted CW-MFC (R2), and one unplanted CW-MFC (R3). Bioenergy production in R2 and R3 was also monitored. In terms of COD removal, R2 reactor achieved 93.13 ± 4.83% efficiency, and R1 and R3 achieved 87.21 ± 4.56% and 86.31 ± 4.37% efficiencies, respectively. BOD removal efficiency in R1, R2, and R3 reactors were found to be similar around 91.79 ± 3.58% to 92.7 ± 3.3%. The total coliform removal was better in R1 (log 2.95) than in R2 (log 2.93). However, the fecal coliform removal in R2 was much higher (log 3.51) compared to R1 (log 2.94). Coliform and organic removal deteriorated during winter time, though electricity generation remained unaffected. The maximum open-circuit voltage in R2 was 886 mV and in the R3 was 487 mV during the complete study. Plants played a positive role in enhancing the electrical performance of R2 compared to unplanted R3 by increasing the redox potential. Presence of dissolved oxygen in the range of 1.97–2.1 mg/L was also detected near the rhizosphere of the planted reactors. Combined role of plants and electrodes was crucial for COD removal and anaerobic condition near anode with low ORP governed the pathogen removal from domestic wastewater.

In particular, two systems were analysed: 1) a system treating urban wastewater, and 2) another system treating wastewater from the food industry. Moreover, these alternatives were compared to 3) a system for bioproducts production from microalgae grown in a standard growth medium. The recovered bioproducts in all the systems considered were: natural pigments, biogas and digestate, which can be reused as biofertilizer. Results showed that the scenario using standard growth medium was the one showing the best results in all impacts and stakeholder categories (up to 24-fold lower impacts depending on the impact category). This was mainly due to: i) the simplicity of the system, which consequently improves health and safety for workers; ii) the absence of contaminants which consequently improves health and safety, acceptability and olfactory impact for both consumers and the local community; iii) the presence of well-established legislation, regulatory frameworks, and full-scale deployment, which benefit value chain actors and society.

This study presents a comprehensive method for the performance analysis of a geothermal combined single-effect evaporator without a steam jet ejector and a single-effect evaporator with a steam jet ejector for the production of 1 kg of fresh water per second. To build the geothermal combined single-effect evaporator system, we compared the outcomes of manual computations performed in Excel and MATLAB/Simulink.

Calculations performed manually, Excel or MTALB/Simulink, should all have the same value, with only a little variation. In this case, latent and sensible heat for seawater evaporation is supplied by low enthalpy geothermal heat employed as heating steam with a temperature of less than 130 °C. We focus on a wide range of characteristics to better understand the impact of design choices on evaluation findings. Some variables include heating steam temperature, boiling temperature, feed water salinity, and geothermal resource quality.

Model-based operational decisions are complicated by uncertainties in model input parameters, which propagate through the model resulting in uncertain model predictions. Previous works have focused on conducting sensitivity analyses of input parameters in various water quality reactions and the interactions with hydraulic factors, but have overlooked the specific contribution of hydraulic and chemical parameter uncertainty. In this work, a framework for assessing the hydraulic and chemical uncertainty in water quality models is presented and demonstrated using monochloramine decay in WDSs supplied by gravity and pumping systems. In the first step, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to determine the influential and non-influential chemical parameters which govern the rate of monochloramine decay. In the second step, Monte Carlo simulations are used to explore the individual and combined effects of uncertainty in hydraulic and chemical parameters. Results show that uncertainty in modeled monochloramine concentration increases with water age and higher reaction rates, varies throughout the course of a day, and heavily depends on hydraulic variability, emphasizing the need to account for input uncertainty. The computational tool developed in this work can be extended to other reaction mechanisms, water quality parameters, and distribution systems for case-specific conditions, and used to evaluate system-wide effects of uncertainty on water quality.

The optimized RPLDH0.8 (RP/ZnAl-LDH0.8)/Vis system was found with a high tetracycline hydrochloride (TC) degradation rate of 89% in 90 min. Moreover, the total organic carbon (TOC) removal rate was obtained as 21%. As indicated by the results of the experiments and characterization, the fast catalytic process arose from the S-scheme charge transfer pathway in RP/ZnAl-LDH.

However, no studies have been conducted to discuss and compare the synergistic contribution to membrane fouling mitigation under thermal synergy. Herein, heat/Fe2+/PS and heat/PAC/PS systems were used to alleviate membrane fouling during municipal wastewater recycling in an aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor (AGMBR), and the effects of oxidation, coagulation, and adsorption on the membrane fouling mitigation were analyzed. The results showed that heat/Fe2+/PS and heat/PAC/PS effectively increased the filtration flux, decreased the fouling resistance, and maintained the membrane surface morphology. Compared to heat/PAC/PS, the heat/Fe2+/PS exhibited better control of membrane fouling owing to the generation of sulfate radicals and Fe3+. The non-radical effect is an important way to mitigate membrane fouling by heat/PAC/PS. Moreover, the pretreatment systems were effective in decomposition and removal of large-particle-size pollutants owing to their excellent oxidation capacity. According to the extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek theory, the heat/Fe2+/PS system had the higher energy barrier values of foulant–membrane (155.31 kT) and foulant–foulant (113.75 kT). The cake filtration and intermediate blocking models were the major mechanisms of membrane fouling, and efficient removal of chemical oxygen demand (R 2 >0.93) and suspended solids (R 2 >0.92) were beneficial to the membrane fouling mitigation.

A commonly used method for assessing water quality is the Water Quality Index (WQI). Artificial intelligence (AI) can predict the WQI rapidly and more accurately than conventional methods. In this study, a stacking ensemble model based on Deep Learning (DL) was proposed to predict the WQI by integrating three models: Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Generalized Linear Model (GLM) and Neural Network (NN). The performance of this model was compared with that of Deep Dense Neural Network (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The inclusion of a DNN model, which was used for the first time in water pollution research to perform sensitivity and uncertainty analysis in predicting WQI, added a new dimension to the workflow. The mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and correlation coefficient (R2) were used to evaluate the performance of the WQI prediction models. The results showed that the WQI of the water samples ranged from 90.75 to 145.29, indicating poor to very poor water quality. The validation results showed that the stack model was superior to all other models in terms of prediction accuracy, with MSE of 25.77, RMSE of 5.07, MAE of 3.5 and R2 of 0.98. The DNN-based sensitivity analysis showed that pH and turbidity significantly affect the WQI and should be monitored to minimise water pollution.

To facilitate and communicate the potential benefits of such technologies, NextGen developed Serious Games (SGs), enabled by underlying System Dynamic Models (SDMs), for demonstrating how interactions between water, energy, and materials/embedded resources within the urban water cycle can be utilised in the context of the Circular Economy of water. As part of a fast-track development process, a testbed dubbed “Toy Town” was developed that encompasses a range of technologies and options that provides a demonstrable framework that can later be refined and modified accordingly for other case studies. The underlying SDM driving the SG is built using the Julia programming language. The testbed incorporates a range of components, including water-saving and water-reuse technologies, stormwater management, and wastewater treatment systems. The SDM acts fundamentally as a mass-balance model tracking over time volumetric flows of water/wastewater and the concentrations/dilution of pollutants/material within the urban water cycle. A variety of water use, water reuse and wastewater treatment components can be tested within this model to maximise the resource potential of the water and material moving through the cycle.

This situation drives an increasing need to pursue more sustainable futures and to conserve and maximise the use of resources whenever possible. The EU-funded H2020 NextGen project aimed to boost sustainability using new and novel technologies and approaches implemented within the water cycle, and to maximise the efficient use of water and water-embedded resources. To facilitate and communicate the potential benefits of such technologies, NextGen developed Serious Games (SGs), enabled by underlying System Dynamic Models (SDMs), for demonstrating how interactions between water, energy, and materials/embedded resources within the urban water cycle can be utilised in the context of the Circular Economy of water. As part of a fast-track development process, a testbed dubbed “Toy Town” was developed that encompasses a range of technologies and options that provides a demonstrable framework that can later be refined and modified accordingly for other case studies. The underlying SDM driving the SG is built using the Julia programming language. The testbed incorporates a range of components, including water-saving and water-reuse technologies, stormwater management, and wastewater treatment systems. The SDM acts fundamentally as a mass-balance model tracking over time volumetric flows of water/wastewater and the concentrations/dilution of pollutants/material within the urban water cycle. A variety of water use, water reuse and wastewater treatment components can be tested within this model to maximise the resource potential of the water and material moving through the cycle. The paper focuses on an extreme drought scenario and highlights the benefits of a modelling testbed for exploring potential technological solutions for managing the urban water cycle and how such solutions can be employed in the context of the circular economy of water. The NextGen SG thus has the potential to improve stakeholders’ understanding of the implementation of novel technologies in the water cycle and the benefits that could be accrued by such stakeholder groups.";"2023-06-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623011769";"6";"Water Refinement"

Against this backdrop, the existing body of knowledge is bereft of a study employing Artificial Intelligence-based techniques for the prediction of BOD5 and COD. Thus, in this study, Gene expression programming (GEP), multilayer perception neural networks, multi-linear regression, k-nearest neighbors, gradient boosting, and regression trees -based models were trained for predicting BOD5 and COD, using monthly data collected from the inflow of 7 WWTPs over a three-year period in Hong Kong. Based on different statistical parameters, GEP provides more accurate estimations, with R2 values of 0.784 and 0.861 for BOD5 and COD respectively. Furthermore, results of sensitivity analysis undertaken by monte Carlo simulation revealed that both BOD5 and COD were mostly affected by concentrations of total suspended solids, and a 10% increase in the value of TSS resulted in a 7.94% and 7.92% increase in the values of BOD5 and COD, respectively. It is seen that the GEP modeling results complied with the fundamental chemistry of the wastewater quality parameters and can be further applied on other sewage sources such as industrial sewage and leachate. The promising results obtained pave the way for forecasting the operational parameters during sludge processing, leading to an extensive energy savings during the wastewater treatment processes.";"2023-06-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623011770";"61";"Water Refinement"

In Nordic countries, on-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) are mostly used in sparsely populated areas and are regulated for the removal of phosphorus (Tot-P), organic matter (biological oxygen demand, (BOD7)) and total nitrogen (Tot-N). However, available reports, albeit commonly using small data sets, call attention to often low and variable treatment performance. In this work, a statistical analysis of 1301 samples from 395 units reported in 10 studies from Finland and Sweden was conducted. The objective was to increase knowledge regarding the effluent water quality of OWTS and their compliance with regulations. In addition, the goal was to identify possible factors affecting contaminant concentrations. Overall, compliance with base-level BOD7 removal requirements was met by most units while 10% of units exceeded Tot-N and >25% exceeded Tot-P limits. Non-compliance rates were high, especially for Tot-P, considering the studied data set was composed mostly of semi-new units (median 3.8 years). Neither weather (air temperature, precipitation, and snowmelt), age or load factors were found to strongly explain the data variability in either soil-based systems (SBS) or package plants (PP). Tot-N and Tot-P effluent concentrations of the two systems were not significantly different. Effluent BOD7 concentrations were lower in SBS (median 3.0 mg/L) when compared to PP (median 7.7 mg/L). Units with P-sorbing filters (median 0.69 mg/L) and chemical precipitation (median 1.54 mg/L), presented lower Tot-P effluent concentrations in contrast to traditional sand filters (median 4.0 mg/L). The biological process used in PP had a measurable effect on effluent BOD7 concentrations, with attached growth units presenting higher values (median 8.1 mg/L) than suspended growth units (median 7.1 mg/L). Although the data set utilized was large, its analysis revealed intrinsic bias in data collection, especially regarding system types and sampling seasonality with colder winter periods sampling underrepresented. There is a need for data collection to improve to allow conclusive treatment efficiency assessment including possible effects of climate and process-related factors.";"2023-06-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623009149";"8";"Water Refinement"

Composite MOFs, combining MOF with other functional materials, can address some observed weaknesses of MOFs such as low stability in aqueous and acidic-base media, low thermal and chemical stability, and low absorption capacity. This paper focuses on the study of MOF composites and their applications for the removal of inorganic toxic compounds containing heavy metals, iodine, phosphate, nitrites, and chlorides from wastewater using adsorption and degradation techniques. MOF composites based on carbon compounds, nanoparticles, and polymers are introduced. In addition, the absorption mechanism and role of each portion of the composite for the absorption of analyte molecules are described.

However, the pollutant removal efficiency of CW is low due to the limitation of DO concentration. In this study, a falling water enhanced tidal flow constructed wetlands (F-TFCW) was constructed to solve the problems of insufficient oxygen supply and low pollutant removal efficiency in CW. In this regard, the effects of falling water reoxygenation, tidal operation, and flood rest ratio (F/R) on the pollutant removal performance of F-TFCW were examined. Also, the pollutant removal mechanism of F-TFCW was revealed through microbial analysis and biochar XPS characterization. The results showed that the COD, NH4 +-N, and TP removal rates of F-TFCW were 99.50 ± 0.21%, 87.16 ± 1.76%, and 88.43 ± 1.35%, respectively, when the F/R was 3:1. The falling water inflow and tidal operation significantly improved the reaeration influence of the constructed wetland. The microbial community analysis represented that the dominant bacteria of the F-TFCW could degrade organic compounds or adapt to tidal flow operation. The tidal operation remarkably changed the core microorganisms of the artificial wetland. In the flood phase of F-TFCW, the COD removal relied mainly on aerobic degradation and the biochar adsorption process. In the experimental step, the microbes degraded the organic matter adsorbed by biochar, which enabled a certain degree of biochar regeneration. This paper provided a new idea to enhance the pollutant treatment efficiency for constructed wetlands.

However, these targets have not been simultaneously explored in the context of the water supply systems of megacities. In this study, the Water Evaluation and Planning (WEAP) platform is used to explore the energy consumption of the water supply system in Beijing with the energy intensity as the operational cost. The WEAP_Beijing model was built to analyze the energy consumption, water storage, and structure of water supply sources in Beijing from 2001 to 2019. The results indicate that the energy consumption of the water supply system in Beijing has been increasing since 2001; additionally, the energy intensity has increased from 2001 to 2013 and has varied between 1.15 and 1.25 kWh/m³ since 2014. This increasing trend is mainly driven by the increasing ratios of transported water and reclaimed water in the water supply system and by the current use strategy of transported water. Scenario analysis showed that transported water and reclaimed water have increased local water storage but have also led to increased energy consumption, which depends on their ratios in the total water supply and the water use strategy. The water supply structure of each water use sector was simulated and displayed distinct dynamics. An energy-friendly water supply system was proposed to adjust transported water use strategies, optimize the ratio of reclaimed water in the water supply, and manage water and energy from a holistic perspective. The results of this study suggest that a policy evaluation of current water policies is needed to secure and sustain the water supply in megacities.

A new covalently cross-linked IRMOF-3-NH2/PVC membrane with dual functions of ultrafiltration and adsorption was fabricated by the phase inversion method. The performance of the prepared membranes was evaluated for the removal of complex contaminants from water. The results showed that with the addition of IRMOF-3-NH2, the anti-fouling, mechanical and adsorption properties of the IRMOF-3-NH2/PVC membranes were significantly improved simultaneously. When 8 wt% IRMOF-3-NH2 was added to PVC, the contact angle of the filter membrane decreased from 95.8° to 68.2°, the pure water flux increased from 158.2 L/(m2·h·bar) to 326.7 L/(m2·h·bar), and the tensile strength increased from 3.24 MPa to 3.83 MPa. More importantly, the membranes could achieve retention rates of 96%, 92% and 79% for BSA, BPA and Cd2+ ions, respectively. By regenerating the membrane with a mixture of ethanol and acetic acid, the membrane could maintain a high retention capacity after five cycles.

The physicochemical properties of the Fe/Mg-BC were analyzed by several characterization methods such as XRD, XPS, SEM and FTIR. Pb(II) and Cd(II) adsorption amounts of Fe/Mg-BC in monometallic systems is larger than those in bimetallic systems owing to competitive adsorption. The adsorption mechanism analysis indicated that ion exchange and mineral precipitation were responsible for Pb(II) and Cd(II) adsorption. The overlap of electron clouds and orbits between MgO and Pb(II) is denser than that of Cd(II), indicating that Fe/Mg-BC has a stronger affinity for Pb(II) than for Cd(II) based on density functional theory calculations. The reusability result indicates that Fe/Mg-BC shows excellent Pb(II) and Cd(II) adsorption performance. Fe/Mg-BC presented remarkable adsorption capability, excellent recoverability, and high throughput, indicating its potential application in the treatment of wastewater containing heavy metals.

For this purpose, the root-cause analysis for fouling mitigation derived from influent characteristics, the techno-economic and toxicity reduction assessments of hairwork dyeing effluent (HDE) reclamation via three membrane-based hybrid systems approaching zero discharge were systematically carried out. The experimental results showed that with the aid of a novel efficient and biodegradable flocculant, the lower fluorescence peak intensity, the more negative zeta potential and the quantitatively dominant hydrophobic components in feedwater all helped to mitigate the same-charged hydrophilic TFN-CQDs membrane fouling due to modification of itself. Accordingly, the optimal processing technology required the minimum amount and replacement frequency for membrane elements and less than 1/5 and 1/10 of the energy consumption and chemicals of their counterparts, respectively. Besides, it also decreased the waste (brine) stream volume fraction to 7%, and greatly increased B/C value of supernatant to 0.667, thus strengthening “intermediate control” of pollutants. Although the organic contaminant components in HDE basically transcend the aromatic/hydrophilic differences in producing biotoxicity, all schemes still had good performance in its elimination. Undoubtedly, the outcome of these evaluations will provide valuable technical guidance for scaling-up the prototype results and promoting the cleaner production of local wig enterprises.

Still, the extracellular antibiotic resistance genes (eARGs) lack research in DWSS, which are essential in the spread of antibiotic resistance and pose a potential threat to human health. This study aims to investigate the pollution level and changing trends of eARGs in DWSS and to analyze the causes and influencing factors. Here, the raw water, the filtered water, the finished water from the drinking water treatment plant, the tap water from four distribution network sites, and the biofilm of different layers of the distribution system were sampled and analyzed from October 2019 to July 2021. We found that the drinking water treatment process before chlorination increased the total eARGs absolute abundance, up to 8.64 folds. In contrast, chlorination disinfection removed most eARGs (average removal rate of over 78.18%). The drinking water transportation increased the eARGs content. The absolute abundance of total eARGs (7.53 × 105–7.26 × 107 copies/L) in tap water was significantly higher than that of iARGs (2.63 × 105–3.26 × 106 copies/L) (p < 0.01, n = 13), indicating that the eARGs pollution was more severe than iARGs in drinking water distribution system.

Since 2020, China has implemented a rigorous lockdown policy, which has sternly damaged sectoral trade in export-oriented coastal areas. Fujian Province, which mainly processes imported materials, has a more profound influence. Although the COVID-19 lockdown has had some detrimental consequences on the world economy, it also had some favorable benefits on the global ecology. Previous studies have shown that the lockdown has altered the physical water quantity and quality, but the lack of total, virtual, and physical water research that combines water quantity and water quality simultaneously to pinpoint the subject and responsibility of water resources consumption and pollution. This research quantified the physical, virtual, and total water consumption and water pollution among 30 sectors in Fujian Province based on the theory of water footprint and the Economic Input-Output Life Cycle Assessment model. SDA model was then used to investigate the socioeconomic elements that underpin variations in the water footprint. The results show that after the lockdown, the physical water quantity and the physical grey WF in Fujian Province decreased by 2.6 Gm3 (−6.7%) and 0.4 Gm3 (−1.3%) respectively. The virtual water quantity decreased by 2.3 Gm3 (−4.5%), whereas the virtual grey WF rose by 1.5 Gm3 (4.3%). The total water quantity dropped by 3.3 Gm3 (−4.9%), while the grey WF increased by 1.2 Gm3 (2.5%), i.e. the COVID-19 lockdown decreases physical water quantity and improves local water quality. More than 50% of the water comes from virtual water trade outside the province (virtual water is highly dependent on external), and around 60% of the grey WF comes from physical sewage in the province. The COVID-19 lockdown reduced water outsourcing across the province (paid nonlocally decrease) but increased pollution outsourcing (paid nonlocally increase). And gross capital formation's contribution to the growth in water footprint will continue to rise. As a result, this study suggested that Fujian should take advantage of sectoral trade network to enhance the transaction of green water-intensive intermediate products, reduce the physical water consumption of blue water-intensive sectors, and reduce the external dependence on water consumption. Achieving the shared responsibility of upstream and downstream water consumption and reducing the external dependence on water in water-rich regions is crucial to solving the world's water problems.

Distinguished from the simple membrane catalysis separation, the as-prepared hybrid membrane (CuO@PDA/PEI-NWF) showed the better ability in oxidizing the high-toxic p-nitrophenol (4-NP) in feed while its permeate liquid backflowing constantly with the aid of a cross flow device. Within 60 min, even a small area of CuO@PDA/PEI-NWF (9.0 cm2) with only ∼0.2 g weight could generate vast of reactive species (1O2, SO4 •‾, and •OH) with trace PMS (1 mM) activation, and then reduced ∼40% of COD in a large volume (1 L) of 5 ppm 4-NP polluted water. The removal of 4-NP was further increased with more PMS added in the cyclic membrane catalysis system. The highest degradation rate could be achieved at pH close to the neutral state due to the better redox circle of Cu2+/Cu+ in the system. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) revealed that the 4-NP structure was primarily destroyed by the addition reaction of radicals (SO4 •‾, and •OH), while its oxidation mineralization was caused by the formed 1O2, during the cyclic membrane catalysis system. Most importantly, this CuO@PEI/PDA-NWF/PMS cyclic system displayed excellent robustness and sustainability without tedious catalyst separation/regeneration processes in treating the 4-NP polluted real water.

Electrocatalytic advanced oxidation through selective two-electron oxygen reduction on cathodes is a promising method of mineralizing organic wastewater. However, most developed cathodes cannot efficiently synthesize H2O2 in situ via 2e− pathways and their durability cannot be guaranteed due to Fe2+ leaching.

Additionally, the physical property and adsorption capability of calcium-based adsorbents can be tuned by control over calcination temperatures and DMDBS loadings. Under optimal preparation conditions (700 °C and 0.4 wt% DMDBS), the synthesized mesoporous adsorbent can achieve a Langmuir adsorption capacity of 48.8 mmol g−1 at pH of 7 and a removal efficiency of 70% in a mimicking natural water with the existence of NaCl. Thermodynamic analysis of equilibriums indicates that the adsorption reaction of fluoride with synthesized adsorbents from water is endothermic and spontaneous in nature. Most significantly, the results demonstrate that adsorbents with surface mesopores possess enriched ionized surface hydroxyl groups, CaO-, which act as the dominant species for fluoride attraction via electrostatic force at a neutral environment. This finding can be supported by the zeta potential analysis and surface speciation calculation. Moreover, the fluoride adsorption capacities of DMDBS-synthesized adsorbents are stable over neutral pH range of 6–8, revealing a promising potential for practical applications in fluoride-contaminated groundwater.

Although many approaches have been developed, most of them showed low efficiency and long processing cycle. Herein, a cost-effective and eco-friendly coated sponge (HDTMS/CuCo-LDHs/PDA@Sponge) was successfully fabricated for the first time via the supersaturated coprecipitation methods, integrating of multistage lamellar layered hydroxides (LDHs) structure, polydopamine (PDA) adhesive layer, and hydrophobic agent. Among them, (i) the complexation of PDA can enhance the growth of CuCo-LDHs, (ii) the large surface area of CuCo-LDHs provided plentiful action sites for linkage of PDA and HDTMS molecules, thus self-strengthened the coating much more firmly, (iii) the cooperation of three buildings significantly promoted the adsorption capacity of coatings to various pollutants. The finally coated sponge showed mechanically durable, superhydrophobicity, salt tolerance, and antibacterial activity, which could efficiently and synchronously absorb MPs (polypropylene and polyethylene), dyestuff, and tiny oil, and the removal rates remained almost 100% for these pollutants. Moreover, the large-scale coated sponge (9 cm × 6 cm × 1 cm) could simultaneously adsorb almost 100% MPs (40 mg/L), Sudan Ⅲ (10 mg/L), and dodecane (20 mL/L) within 1 min. The absorption energy between the coatings and MPs were −1699 kcal/mol for PP and −932.8 kcal/mol for PE, respectively. The adsorption mechanism was ascribed to multiple forces, including electrostatic interaction, capillary attraction, hydrogen bond, p-π conjugation, Van der Waals force, lipophilicity, complexation, surface adhesion of PDA, and lipophilicity of HDTMS clusters. The developed superhydrophobic sponge will be a novel strategy to purify wastewater, especially for the high-salinity and microbial-rich marine environment.

Partial Denitrification Anammox (PDNA) for mainstream treatment applications have transitioned from pilot scale to full-scale within only 5 years, showing a realistic and sustainable solution with savings lying on carbon, energy, and footprint. This review aims to present the recent advances in the partial denitrification (PD) process and its coupling to the anammox process, analyze and critically review fundamental mechanisms and operational strategies responsible for stable PDNA process. A major consideration in the PD process is achieving a stable control of nitrate to nitrite conversion for sustainable nitrite accumulation, which can be achieved by controlling the intermediates involved in the different mechanisms of nitrate reduction. Although the magnitude of nitrite accumulation is reliant on various operational factors; bacterial ecology shift, C/N ratio, SRT decoupling and method of addition and gradient of carbon source (feast-famine conditions) also play an important role, but the significance of such factors has been often neglected. Overall, this study intends to provide insights on the critical parameter including the carbon gradients and feast-famine conditions as the influential operational factors for PD full-scale application.

We grew vertical nanosheets consisting of FeVO4/ZnCo2O4 directly on the surface of iron foam (F–F), which intertwined to form F–F@FeVO4/ZnCo2O4 p-n heterojunction catalysts with a three-dimensional framework structure. The F–F@FeVO4/ZnCo2O4 photocatalyst showed excellent photocatalytic performance achieving 96.32%, 92.85%, 95.92% and 97.17% removal efficiencies in the presence of tetracycline (TC), sulfamethoxazole (SMX), ciprofloxacin (CIP) and Cr(VI), respectively. In addition, the photocatalyst was assembled into a simulated photoreactor, enabling the continuous treatment of composite wastewater. The reactor achieved removal efficiencies of 94.81%, 90.02%, 94.17% and 97.15% for TC, SMX, CIP and Cr(VI), respectively, in a 100 min reaction. Furthermore, only after ten photocatalytic cycles under visible light does the catalytic efficiency of the reactor decrease slightly. The excellent performance may be attributed to unique structures that reduce visible light reflection and provide highly reactive reaction centers, as well as surface oxygen vacancies and heterojunctions to accelerate photocarrier separation and free radical generation. The high porosity of F–F also reduces the obstruction of visible light between branches. Moreover, the method of growing FeVO4/ZnCo2O4 active components on F–F overcomes a number of problems (increased interfacial charge transfer impedance, poor structural stability and nonuniform distribution, etc.) associated with conventional methods of combining nanomaterials with recyclable substrates (loading, introduction of adhesives and hybridization, etc.).

The abundant negative charge and hydroxyl functional group as well as pore structure on the adsorbent surface were very conducive to the removal of copper ions.

This study investigated the potential for acidifying anaerobically digested cattle slurry (digestate), shifting the NH4 +:NH3 equilibrium towards the less toxic ionised form, thus allowing the growth of Lemna minor on less dilute wastewater. First, a study was conducted to identify the ammoniacal-N concentrations tolerated by L. minor and to confirm the positive effect of lower pH on growth in high nutrient solutions using modified Hutner's solutions at two pH levels (8.2 and 6.5). In Hutner's solution at a pH of 8.2, L. minor growth was highest at the lowest ammoniacal-N concentration of 10 mg L−1 and decreased with increasing concentrations. At a pH of 6.5, L. minor growth remained unaffected with increasing ammoniacal-N up to a concentration of 250 mg L−1. L. minor was then grown in digestate concentrations ranging from 5% (65 mg L−1 ammoniacal-N) to 30% (350 mg L−1 ammoniacal-N), based on its growth in Hutner's solutions. It was hypothesised, that growth would decrease as the digestate concentration increased at pH 8.2, and that acidifying digestate to pH 6.5 would alleviate this effect. On unamended digestate (pH 8.2), L. minor growth was prevented even in the most dilute treatment (5%); however, on acidified digestate (pH 6.5), growth rates remained positive and significantly higher than the unamended controls up to the 20% dilution (239.3 mg L−1 ammoniacal-N). Higher growth rates in the Hutner's solutions compared to digestate, particularly at pH 8.2 where no growth was recorded in digestate, suggest the presence of additional inhibitory factors in complex, high-nutrient wastewaters, and potentially sub-optimal concentrations of some of the nutrients provided in Hutner's solution.

For the first time, we demonstrate that by lowering pH, L. minor could be grown on dilutions of nutrient-rich agricultural wastewater that were otherwise toxic, and which make it feasible as a nutrient removal method.

The nut shells generated in the industrial processing have been discarded for use as soil conditioner or energy production. This waste material is rich in polyphenols, which can be used for various purposes, including well-established applications and new usages. Tannin-based coagulants/flocculants for water treatment are one of the emerging applications. Polyphenols extraction from vegetal sources is the initial step of the coagulant synthesis. In this work, tannin extraction from chestnut shell was accomplished in aqueous solution through different methods. After a preliminary assessment, microwave-assisted method (MAE) was selected to be optimized using Response Surface Methodology. The effect of extraction time, liquid:solid ratio, and temperature on the extraction yield and total phenolic content of the extracts was examined. The desirability function approach was applied to find the best extraction conditions leading to a quantitative extract with the highest phenolic content. The optimum conditions were determined as extraction time of 5 min, liquid-to-solid ratio of 50 mL g−1 and temperature 107 °C. In these optimized conditions, the expected extraction yield and phenolic content of the extract are 25 ± 3% and 344 ± 27 mg-GAE/g, respectively (values confirmed by experimental assays). The optimal extract presented a condensed tannin content of 1296 ± 68 mg-CE/g. This work showed that polyphenols can be quantitatively extracted from chestnut shells through a green approach and the generated extract has good features to be further used as a raw material for water treatment coagulants.";"2023-04-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623006108";"59";"Water Refinement"

There is a need for the search of good coaguflocculants that avoid release of intracellular toxins for a safer sustainable production. Clay-polymer interactions were examined for the development of efficient composites for their use as coaguflocculants for Microcystis aeruginosa (M. aeruginosa) suspensions. Polymers derived from poly-4-vinylpyridine (PVP) were quaternized on the pyridinic N by introducing methyl and hydroxyethyl moieties. These polymers were toxic per se; however, composites prepared either from their sorption or grafting on the clay surface of a montmorillonite exhibited null toxicity, The combination of infrared and X-ray diffraction data with thermal analysis showed a train conformation of the sorbed polymers on the clay surface whereas a brush conformation was elucidated for the grafted polymers. Only the composite prepared from grafting and subsequent quaternization with methyls was an efficient coaguflocculant, due to its high positive surface potential (+39 mV) which allowed a close contact between the quaternary moieties of the brushes and the negative cell wall. A patch flocculation mechanism was involved, with the riks of resuspension of the coagulated cells if the composite added in excess. The optimum ratio between the amount of coagulated cyanobacteria and this composite expressed as equivalent to polymer content was 7.2 × 107 cells/mg polymer. This ratio was determined in axenic cultures of M. aeruginosa, but was reduced 5-fold in natural surface waters due to natural organic matter (NOM) content and heterogeneity. This study has demonstrated the relevance of the type of modification of the clay mineral surface with polymers to obtain good coaguflocculants of cyanobacterial cells, that can be extended to other microorganisms.";"2023-03-25";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623005140";"13";"Water Refinement"

The challenges of urban water management and water scarcity indicate the urgency for the transition to water circularity, and provide an opportunity for integrating NBS in cities. Evidence on the co-benefits of NBS has been gathered in the past 20 years, while applications across the globe provide us with knowledge on their modularity, effectiveness in hybridization and siting in urban environments. This article provides new insights and perspectives compared to published reviews, as it bridges a broad range of disciplinary topics: NBS, non-conventional water sources, circularity, urban design, and urban planning. Based on the scoping literature review of 68 peer-reviewed research articles, four key dimensions for the design and integration of circular water NBS in cities are identified: environmental technology, systems design, urban design, and urban planning.

The development of doped carbon was performed by an original method based on direct pyrolysis with thermal shock/impregnation in H3PO4 at 25 °C, representing a clean and sustainable process. The optimal Phosphorus-doped carbon was obtained at 950 °C with a yield of about 17%. The optimized Phosphorus-doped carbon is microporous, has a high specific surface (1939 m2 g−1) and rich in anionic active sites. Adsorption tests showed a high adsorption capacity, up to 1123 mg g−1 for Crystal violet and 1010 mg g−1 for Methylene blue. The removal rates reached up to 97% and the application in real wastewater treatment showed an efficiency of 69%. The equilibrium data were better fitted to the Langmuir isotherm and the kinetics were better described by the pseudo second order model. The initial adsorption kinetics can reach up to 51 mg g−1.min−1 for Methylene blue and 283 mg g−1.min−1 for Crystal violet.

Herein, we synthesized a visible-light-driven (VLD) photocatalyst by modifying dodecyl benzene sulfonate (DBS) onto graphitic carbon nitride nanosheet (CNNS), and studied its photocatalytic performance for removing high-concentration moxifloxacin (MOX), a fourth-generation quinolone antibiotic.

This study surveyed the discharge characteristic of rural greywater, and proposed onsite treatment of decentralized rural greywater using a novel ecological seepage well (ESW). In northwestern China, four rural households produced greywater with an average quantity of 128–146 L/d, with chemical oxygen demand (COD) of 213.6–235.9 mg/L as the main pollutant. For treating greywater, ESW with ceramsite and zeolite mixed in the packing layers and metallic corrugated plates (MCPs) set in the aeration zone achieved higher removal efficiencies of COD, total phosphorous (TP), total nitrogen (TN) and ammonia nitrogen (NH4 +-N). When the influent C/N ratio was 16, the enhanced removal performance was realized by cutoff duration of 9 h, and the effluent met the Chinese standard for irrigation water quality with COD, TP, TN and NH4 +-N removal efficiencies of 88.58%, 65.60%, 92.94% and 93.65%, respectively.

The variation of EPS and microbial morphology along the height illustrated that a micro-aerobic environment was formed in the lower layer of ESW. High throughput sequencing indicated plentiful denitrifying bacteria (DNB) and denitrifying phosphate accumulating organisms (DNPAOs), together with a higher relative abundance of ammonia oxidizing bacteria (AOB) than nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in the lower layer, which was relative to simultaneous nitrification, denitrification and phosphorous removal.

Compared to conventional activated sludge processes, biofilm-based wastewater treatment processes show great potential for antibiotic biodegradation due to the abundant microbial communities in biofilms. However, limted review work is available on the underlying antibiotic biodegradation mechanisms and microbial communities to date. This review indicated that metabolism and cometabolism induced by the functional microorganisms were the major biodegradation mechanisms in the biofilm, despite variations among different biofilm-based reactors. The cometabolism induced by autotrophic ammonia oxidizing microorganisms, heterotrophic bacteria or fungi had a significant contribution. Core microbial communities were identified with antibiotic degrading abilities (e.g., Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes and Actinobacteria), although more efforts are needed to confirm the relationship between microorganisms and antibiotic biodegradation under different operating conditions. The impact of antibiotic exposure was explored to identify its stimulating or inhibiting effects on microbial communities. Generally, biodegradation products of antibiotics in biofilm-based processes had simpler structures and lower molecular weights than those in the activated sludge system. The results indicated the potential of the biofilm-based treatment processes towards efficient removal of antibiotics and conventional pollutants simultaneously, as well as eliminating antimicrobial activities, via feasible regulatory strategies.

In this work, a series of environment-friendly anionic-nonionic gemini surfactants, namely, ethylene glycol succinate polyoxyethylene sulfonate (GEOnS-m, n = 3, 5 and 7; m = 10 and 12), were synthesized and evaluated for application in SEAR. The critical micelle concentrations of GEOnS-m were 2.14 × 10−3–1.62 × 10−2 mM, and the molar solubilization ratios of GEOnS-m for tetrachloroethylene were 1.93–3.44, which were 1.5–5 times higher than traditional surfactants. The GEOnS-m solutions remained stable at 5–25 °C, 50 mM salt, and pH = 5.0–9.0. The micelle size decreased as the temperature decreased, which reduced the solubilization capacity (24.9%–37.0%) of the GEOnS-m solutions. Inorganic salts could improve the solubilization capacity of the GEOnS-m solutions by promoting micelle polymerization and increasing the hydrophobic core volume for solubilizing tetrachloroethylene. This work found that 0.80%–4.00% of GEOnS-m adsorbed on the media during simulated column flushing, which was less than the traditional surfactants due to stronger electrostatic repulsion between the micelles and the media. Meanwhile, the solubilization capacity of GEOnS-m was positively correlated with the hydrophobic carbon chain length, while, the adsorption amount in the media and application cost of GEOnS-m were positively correlated with the EO number and negatively correlated with the hydrophobic carbon chain length. Comprehensive evaluation results revealed that GEO3S-12 was preferred for SEAR.

Meanwhile, climate change caused by CO2 emissions has become one of the most significant concerns, and countries around the world are now working to achieve “carbon neutrality”.

However, the facile and efficient synthesis of high-quality LDHs and their composites remains a challenge. Here, an improved co-pyrolysis method has been developed to synthesize LDH/biochar composites. A composite material was prepared by directly anchoring MgFe-LDH on corn stover by co-precipitation with FeCl3 and Mg(OH)2, and then through pyrolysis. The main features of this improved method are the use of the solubility product Mg(OH)2 to maintain the pH of the mixture at ∼10 (the optimum for LDH precipitation), eliminating the cumbersome pH control steps of the traditional co-precipitation method, and the low rate of solid-liquid reaction to obtain high LDH crystallinity and purity. This produces improved properties of the MgFe-LDH/biochar composite after pyrolysis: higher loading of MgFe-LDH, larger specific surface area of the composite, a more stable layered structure, and a more customizable LDH. The theoretical maximum adsorption capacity of phosphorus for the composite was 379.4 mg L−1 according to an adsorption isotherm study, and the dominant adsorption mechanism is chemical adsorption accompanied by physical adsorption.

The results showed that adsorption was consistent with pseudo-second order model and Langmuir model. Thermodynamic results demonstrated that adsorption phenomenon was an exothermic reaction that occurred spontaneously.

Both methodological approaches present limitations such as overfitting issues or require assumptions about the production technology which could lead to less reliable efficiency scores. To overcome these limitations, in this study, and for the first time, we estimated CE of English and Welsh water companies using the Efficiency Analysis Trees (EAT) approach. This technique brings together machine learning and non-linear programming techniques to estimate production frontier and efficiency scores. It also allowed us to quantify the optimal level of GHG emissions in the provision of water services and estimate potential GHG savings. Bootstrap truncated regression methods were employed to quantify the impact of operating characteristics on CE of water companies. The optimal level of GHG emissions was estimated to be between 0.062 and 133.03 tons of CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) per year and per connected property. The average CE was at the level of 0.632. This means that GHG emissions could reduce by 36.8% to maintain the same level of water services. Equivalently, this corresponds to a reduction of 488,321 tons of CO2eq per year. Water only companies exhibited a better performance than water and sewerage companies with an average CE of 0.785 and 0.540, respectively.

Herein, pollutants removal efficiency from the municipal wastewater and the effect of operational parameters is verified under a visible range of light in a PEC system using TiO2–Bi(mixed metal)-MOF and TiO2–Sb(mixed metal)-MOF anodes, respectively. The comparable efficiency of pollutant removal from municipal wastewater in the PEC system with TiO2–Bi(mixed metal)-MOF anodes is high. At optimum operation parameters, TiO2–Bi(mixed metal)-MOF anodes in the PEC system play a positive role in the removal of micropollutants and the disinfection of municipal wastewater.

In this study, a new method of modifying hydrophobic fumed silica (FS) on the evaporation layer surface is proposed to enhance the evaporation performance of the interfacial evaporator. It is found that the FS suspension concentration has great control over the microstructure and surface wettability of the evaporated layer, and the water-air interface area of the evaporated surface is effectively expanded. As a result, the evaporation rate within the closed chamber is enhanced by ∼14% to 1.33 kg m−2 h−1 at the light intensity input of 1 kW m−2. The mechanism of performance enhancement is illustrated by simulations and modeling calculations. To further improve the evaporation performance, we constructed a 10-stage multistage distillation (MSD) device to recycle latent heat and achieve an evaporation rate of 5.03 kg m−2 h−1 at 1 kW m−2 light intensity. In addition, the device was proven to operate efficiently and stably in brine and achieve zero liquid discharge.

It requires being acquainted with the individual components involved in the urban water cycle such as stormwater, water conveyance, groundwater, water drainage, wastewater treatment and discharge. In addition, to appreciate benefits and tradeoffs in the context of Circular Economy, one also needs to factor the interrelations between water and other factors such as material recovery, energy use, expenses, and environmental impacts. On top of it, the fact that each catchment has a different geography, hydrology and urban setup can lead to difficulties in transferring gathered knowledge to other situations. In response to this challenge of developing a holistic understanding of applying Circular Economy to the urban water cycle, the NextGen Serious Game has been created. It is a simulation based online educational tool with a digital user interface that allows participants to explore the implications of applying circular economy strategies such as “Reduce” (for waste), Reuse (for materials), and Recovery (of energy though biogas generation) to the water urban cycle in different virtual catchments representing different settings. Several physical and online game-playing events took place where participants were able to take the appropriate measures to maximise Circular Economy for water when a virtual catchment was exposed to challenging scenarios, e.g., lower rainfalls and population growth. The players included students, environmental scientists, engineers, policy makers, and members of the public. The serious game was successfully used as a teaching tool in student classrooms (leading to an average improvement of about 26% in the number of correct answers). Furthermore, it made an effective debate facilitation tool contributing to the discussion of a multi-disciplinary expert panel by bringing new insights to the discussion. Finally, the Serious Game was used to organize the first e-sport competitive tournament between water professionals at an industry conference, paving the way for a novel form of engagement. This is a considerable contribution to public understanding at a time where the water industry struggles to sensitize a wider audience to the problems and reality of water in the context of climate change, growing resources scarcity, and environmental decline.";"2023-03-10";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623001580";"16";"Water Refinement"

In this work, viable heterogeneous photo−Fenton catalysts (NCS) are synthesized by in situ compounding nitrogen−doped carbon quantum dots (N−CQDs) with schwertmannite (SCH). Specifically, the NCS catalysts exhibit greatly enhanced capacity for chlortetracycline (CTC) degradation, in comparison with those of the pristine SCH and N−CQDs, with a remarkable efficiency of 95.12% at a wide pH range (3.0–7.0). In particular, this allows an efficient Fe(III)/Fe(II) conversion due to the fast electron transport capability provided by N−CQDs, coupled to an excellent structural stability of the catalysts. Main active species including •OH, •O2 − and 1O2 are identified in the degradation process, and a possible degradation mechanism is tentatively proposed. In addition, related cytotoxicity of CTC degradation intermediates is verified via co−culturing with E. coli.

For commonly used sequential batch or flowing by reactor, the electrostatic repulsion of electric double layer near cathodic surface to NO3‾ anions brings essential adsorption limit, which suppresses the efficiency of NO3‾ reduction. In order to solve this problem, an electrochemical filter was created by installing mesh electrodes with regulated thickness. During saltwater flowing through the filter, NO3‾ have to flow through cathodic holes with diameter of one and half hundred micrometers. Compared with centimeter-scale electrode gap of commonly used reactors, this micrometer-scale diffusion distance increases the concentration gradient, which intensifies NO3‾ diffusion to the cathode surface and counteracts electrostatic repulsion. In line with expectations, for 50.0 mg/L of initial nitrate-N, nitrate-N in effluent of this filter was only 2.0 mg/L, no ammonia-N and nitrite-N were detected, which met Chinese standard of water quality for aquatic mammals in aquariums (SC/T 9411-2012). While for batch process and flow-by process, the effluent concentration of nitrate-N was 60.6% and 47.6% higher than that of flow-through process, respectively. In addition, the filter displayed low energy consumption and wide availability for real recirculating aquaculture saltwater, RO wastewater and metallurgical wastewater. Furthermore, a scale-up reactor was assembled by connecting seventeen filters in series. Its water treatment capacity (5 L/h) exceeded most reported data.

For screening more diverse microalgae to treat raw DWW, the growth characteristics and metabolite production of ten algal strains cultured in undiluted DWW were studied in this paper, among which three were able to tolerate excessive chemical oxygen demand (COD) concentration and yielded high biomass concentration. Under the condition of 25 ± 1 °C and 55 μmol/m2/s, the most suitable strain were Scenedesmus SDEC-13, Chlorella pyrenoidosa SDEC-35, and Chlorella vulgaris SDEC-34, all of which had biomass concentrations above 1.2 g/L and protein contents above 45%. Based on the feasibility of cultivating microalgae with raw DWW, an alternative alga-based WWTP strategy was provided for the first time. The most important modification was the construction of the photobioreactor (PBR) to replace hydrolytic upflow sludge bed (HUSB) reactor and remove anaerobic-aerobic (AO) pond. The dairy WWTP with a PBR unit (1.68 × 104 m3) will yield a biomass production of 1.44 × 106 kg/year while capturing 2.59 × 106 kg CO2/year.

In this work, a distinctive approach was taken to use an electrochemical heterostructure sensor with chemically reduced nickel boride (Ni3B) nanoparticles anchored in two-dimensional (2D) layered cobalt selenide (CoSe) nanosheets. The prepared hybrid structure (2D CoSe/Ni3B) enables large active sites and a strong synergistic effect between nanostructures to improve the electrocatalytic activity in the detection of water pollutant 5-nitroquinoline (5-NQ) with a disposable screen-printed carbon electrode (SPCE). The 2D CoSe/Ni3B/SPCE exhibits a reduction peak potential of −0.63 V for 5-NQ, with an increased reduction peak current compared to that of other electrodes. The fabricated disposable strip electrode is suitable for the electrochemical testing of pollutants.

To design a robust treatment for this stream, it is important to know the composition and variability through different seasons, companies and processing conditions. An extensive physicochemical and (limited) microbial characterization was done on samples taken from four different blancher types at seven companies for 1.5 years. High concentrations of organic matter, represented as chemical oxygen demand (9032 ± 4349 mg O2/L), glucose (0.26 ± 0.32 g/L) or starch (1.40 ± 1.22 g/L) and dissolved ions (348 ± 142 mg Cl−/L and 1279 ± 510 mg potassium/L) were found, at constant ranges independently of the season. This is probably due to the occurrence of a steady state over time for the physicochemical parameters in the water. Concentrations at this steady state or equilibrium could change depending on the used potatoes-to-water ratio used at the blanchers, which is specific to the company and blancher and hence influences the aforementioned equilibrium.

In this study, we investigate whether lanthanum (La) metal loading can improve the phosphate adsorption capacity of LDH. Based on Ca/Fe–LDH prepared through coprecipitation, a La–Ca/Fe–LDH composite is fabricated by La loading through impregnation. The adsorption capacity of La–Ca/Fe–LDH is 11.4% higher than that of Ca/Fe–LDH. The magnitude of adsorption and accelerated rate of adsorption of La–Ca/Fe–LDH satisfy the quasi-second-order kinetic and Langmuir isothermal equations. When comparing La–Ca/Fe–LDH to Ca/Fe–LDH, the adsorption capacity increased by 3.3%–328.39% in the pH range of 3–11; additionally, the resistance to pH influence and coexisting ion interference was considerably enhanced.

The experimental setup consisted of a vertical tower with five water trays, supported by a metal duct and surrounded by a glass enclosure. The water yield and thermal, exergic, and economic features of the tower were investigated and analyzed. A new performance prediction hybrid model was also developed. A powerful artificial intelligence tool called the random vector functional link (RVFL) neural network was integrated with the Runge Kutta optimizer (RUN) to predict the water yield and temperature of the established tower. The model efficiency was compared to that of pure RVFL and an optimized RVFL model using a particle swarm optimizer (PSO). The drinkable water yield of the proposed design was 2.1 L/m2 (considering the tray area) and 5.3 L/m2 (considering the land use area); energy and exergy efficiencies were ∼31.7% and ∼3.3%, respectively. The cost of the produced drinkable water was approximately $0.013/L. The developed system provides considerable improvement compared with conventional designs of solar stills. The proposed RVFL–RUN model outperformed the pure RVFL and RVFL–PSO models for predicting system performance. The coefficients of determination between the experimental water productivity and water temperature and the predicted values, using the RVFL–RUN model, were 0.91 and 0.97, respectively.

To achieve water conservation, improve the energy efficiency, and meet the low-carbon environmental requirements, this study investigates a new type of pre-pump filtration measure—the micro-pressure filtration and cleaning tank, and the sediment removal (SR), mass of intercepted sediment (Ma), and filtration time (t) are used as evaluation indicators. A uniform orthogonal test was designed to evaluate the influences of the initial sediment concentration, flow rate, and filter area. We carried out simulations using the projection pursuit regression (PPR) method based on physical measurement data, and then NSGA-II (fast elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm) algorithm was used to find the optimal parameter values. The results showed that the order of the factors influencing the SR and Ma of the micro-pressure filtration and cleaning tank was the filter area > initial sediment concentration > flow rate. The order of the factors influencing the filtration time was flow rate > initial sediment concentration > filter area. A PPR prediction model was built based on the filter area, initial sediment concentration, flow rate, and assessment indicators, and the optimal operating conditions were determined (initial sediment concentration: 0.36 kg/m3, flow rate: 7 m3/h, and filter area: 2000 cm2). The research results demonstrated the filtration performance of the micro-pressure filtration and cleaning tank and provide a theoretical basis for the popularization and application of such tanks as well as a reference for sustainable new irrigation technologies.

Accordingly, amine-functionalized lignin microspheres (AL-PEI/GMS) with high porosity, abundant functional groups, and appropriate surface area, were synthesized via a green and simple process, and used as an adsorbent for U(VI) recovery. Results illustrated that AL-PEI/GMS showed outstanding adsorption capacity for U(VI) of 250 mg/g and high selectivity of SFU(VI) > 15, 000 over a wide pH range from one to nine, preeminent regeneration performance with adsorption efficiency > 95% after 50 cycles, and desorption performance (desorption efficiency > 60% after 50 cycles). The high applicability of AL-PEI/GMS was further proven by its high U(VI) removal efficiency under various high-salinity conditions (U(VI) removal rate > 99%). Furthermore, 2553 bed volumes (BV) of the U(VI) feeding streams can be effectively treated by AL-PEI/GMS via a fixed-bed column system with an extremely high flow rate (20 mL/min), and more than 95.6% of U(VI) can be rapidly desorbed by using 12 BV of eluent solution. Furthermore, the comparatively low operational costs and overall economic feasibility further suggested the great potential of AL-PEI/GMS for U(VI) on the industrial scale. The mechanism of U(VI) adsorption on AL-PEI/GMS was further found to be chemisorption-related. This work presents an applicable approach by using amine-functionalized lignin microspheres to achieve highly ultrafast U(VI) adsorption and desorption under a high-salinity condition via a fixed-bed column system, which not only provides a feasible method to purify U-contaminated nuclear wastewater, but also successfully realizes the recycling of U(VI) from nuclear wastewater, thus resolving the increasingly serious energy crisis and protecting environment in the nuclear industry.

However, deterioration in the quality of reclaimed water, such as increased odor and bacterial growth, restrict its reuse. This study compared changes in residual chlorine, BOD5, NH3–N, turbidity, and color in four kinds of reclaimed water that can be reused for flushing household toilets. Bacterial reproduction and regeneration in the reclaimed water and the succession law of the microbial communities were also explored to reveal the influence of biofilm in the reclaimed water on the biological stability of the reclaimed water. The results show that under conditions of 30 °C after the addition of 6 mg/L of chlorine, no bacteria were discovered after 1 month, 20 days, or 10 days in the MBR effluent of greywater (GMBR), BAF effluent of greywater (GBAF), or reclaimed water of mixed domestic wastewater (MWR), respectively. The GMBR was similar to tap water, and was obviously better than the MWR. To control the proliferation of microorganisms, the recommend residual chlorine concentration should be no less than 0.80 mg/L at the point of use. However, when the concentration of residual chlorine in the reclaimed water was less than 0.9 mg/L (GMBR) or 1.5 mg/L (MWR), the chlorine could not kill the bacteria on the biofilm. Therefore, to control the biological stability of the reclaimed water, sufficient residual chlorine should be maintained, and the concentration of organic matter in the reclaimed water should be reduced as much as possible. Our findings showed that recycled greywater is more suitable for flushing household toilets than recycled mixed sewage.

Using renewable lignin to develop efficient flocculants is of great significance to environmental sustainability. Nevertheless, the preparation process of lignin-based flocculant is not only inefficient and cumbersome, but also brings serious pollution, making their development unsustainable. In this study, a new type of ultra-efficient Mannich-functionalized lignin-based flocculants was prepared by a simple, green strategy. Lignin-based flocculants were synthesized by copolymerizing lignin with acrylamide in a UV-induced aqueous copolymerization system and then modified by Mannich with formaldehyde and diethylenetriamine. Comprehensive considering the influence of molecular weight, charge density and amphiphilicity, herein, two different types of lignin-based flocculant (LBF1 and LBF2) could be precisely tuned by adjusting the dose of formaldehyde and diethylenetriamine. The results showed that the turbidity removal rate of LBF1 for kaolin suspension could be up to 99.31%, and the decolorization rate of Acid Black 1, Direct Red 80 and Reactive Red 2 solutions using LBF2 was more than 99.60%, which outperformed almost all other lignin-based flocculants reported in the previous reports.

In batch mode, there was a good removal capacity toward BPA in a broad pH range, the uptake of TC and OTC (TCs) possessed a relatively high adsorption effect at pH of 3.0–4.0. The addition of salinity had a negative result on adsorption. The isotherm behaviors exhibited a monolayer equilibrium removal capacity (q e) of 45.3 mg/g for BPA, with heterogeneous q e of 124 mg/g and 98.4 mg/g for TC and OTC, respectively. These processes were accorded with Koble-Corrigan isotherm model, and the kinetic behaviors followed Elovich equation. The binary experiment elucidated that BPA and TC/OTC removal onto β-CD-HPAN was independent from each other. β-CD-HPAN also elucidated good regeneration performances. Adsorption mechanisms were proposed that β-CD cavities on β-CD-HPAN mainly contributed to entrap molecules of non-polar BPA, carboxyl and hydroxyl groups provided binding sites for polar TCs. The membrane owned antibacterial capacity against gram-positive S. aureus.

Anaerobic methanogenesis, which transforms organic matter to methane, is the pivotal step in most resource-sustainable applications in wastewater treatment, while its evaluation and monitoring are still challenging. This study proposed a novel approach for probing methanogenesis in anaerobic wastewater treatment by in situ determining coenzyme F420 using front-face excitation-emission matrix (FF-EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy. The results indicated that the proposed method was simpler and more accurate than the conventional F420 measurement.

Here, we evaluated the effects of reclaimed water use on water's self-purification capacity in terms of water quality, sedimentary bacterial diversity, bacterial community structure and function. Results showed that reclaimed water use has improved water quality of domestic polluted urban rivers and increased bacterial genus-level abundance, but failed to directly affect bacterial biodiversity indexes and evenness of receiving waters. Water organic matter input from reclaimed water was the decisive factor in shaping sedimentary bacterial community structure rather than temperature.

This work aimed to develop a novel UV irradiation strategy to achieve a trade-off between pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) degradation and disinfection by-products (DBPs) formation during UV/chlorine water treatment under a specific chlorine dose. Under high UV irradiation intensity at the same UV fluence, the faster chlorine photolysis produced higher steady-state concentrations of •Cl and •OH species but abated cumulative exposures of free available chlorine (CT FAC = ∫ 0 t [ C l 2 ] d t ). As a result, the degradation rate of PPCPs was accelerated, but the removal percentage of some PPCPs decreased. Meanwhile, the degradation of the chromophores of dissolved organic matters (DOM) declined by 23.3%–24.8% under the higher UV irradiation intensity. Reducing CT FAC values (50.7%–57.6%) by high UV irradiation intensity could mitigate the formation of haloacetic acids, trihalomethanes and absorbable organic halogens (13.9%–14.9%), which addressed the key role of active chlorine in the formation of DBPs in the UV/chlorine process. DBPs were mainly generated from the interactions of DOM with reactive chlorine. The Vibrio fischeri data further indicated that increasing UV intensity reduced acute toxicity regardless of UV wavelength or water pH.

Several technologies, such as solar stills, solar chimneys, and solar ponds were examined. In the last decade, researchers have proposed direct solar-powered membrane distillation (SP-MD) as an innovative solution to desalinate saline and hypersaline feed water.

In situ formed hydrous titanium oxide possesses much higher As immobilization potential than purchased TiO2 because of its higher specific surface area and more abundant active hydroxyl group, which is proposed to reduce the As uptake of aquatic vegetables planted in As micro-polluted water. Herein, TiOSO4 solution, which can hydrolyze into hydrous titanium oxide during dilution in water, was used as a new water amendment to realize in situ As immobilization in lake water (100 μg-As/L) during cultivation of water spinach. We found that TiOSO4 could immobilize trace level As with its dosage as the main factor influencing the efficiency through response surface analysis. A low dosage TiOSO4 treatment of 0.5 mg/L could reduce the As content in the edible part from 0.64 to 0.40 mg/kg, which satisfied the vegetable As standard of China (0.5 mg/kg).

Thirdly, initial water network is designed based on the chosen matches and the timing of batch operations is determined based on the water reuse.

No significant (<5%) or low (maximum: 25%) sulfate removal from the feedwater were stably observed during the 20 or 21 exhaustion–regeneration cycles without brine treatment or replacement, when <10 μg L−1 As was consistently observed in the product water. Furthermore, this study demonstrated the selective As removal from As-rich sulfate-chloride or sulfate-bicarbonate spent brine by aluminum (Al)- or iron (Fe)-based chemical coagulation or electrocoagulation process. Fe-based electrocoagulation (9-cm interelectrode distance, 0.50 mA cm−2, 15 min) and sulfate-chloride binary brine are finally recommended after metal dosage, sludge production and residual metal concentration among them were compared. No electrocoagulation took place in the sulfate-bicarbonate spent brine even at a current density of 3 mA cm−2 because of high bicarbonate concentration that formed passivation film on the anode surface.

In this study, a novel strategy of coating polyelectrolytes on holey graphene oxide was designed in order to modify the surface charge on a graphene oxide membrane, aiming to simultaneously improve water flux and desalination performance. The resultant highly-charged graphene oxide membrane presents excellent opportunity to connect sheets together by the formation of chemical bonds, subsequently effectively enhancing the stability, surface potential and hydrophilicity of the membrane in water, improving the water flux and desalination performance. The nano-pores of holey graphene oxide, formed by H2O2 etching, can improve the structure of two-dimensional nano-channels between slices and shorten the transport distance of water molecules, thus leading to a higher water flux. Moreover, coating the holey graphene oxide membrane with charged polyelectrolytes enhances excellent ion rejection by the combination of interlayer size screening and electrostatic repulsion. The cationic polyelectrolyte-coated composite membrane can achieve a water flux of 268.49 L m−2·h−1·MPa−1 and the desalination rate of 87.86% for 0.5 g L−1 NaCl, achieving an increase of 3.44 times and 37.65%, respectively, as compared with untreated graphene oxide film.

However, it is not clear which floc structures are suitable for microalgal floatation, whether large and compact flocs or small and loose flocs have good rising performance. In this study, a novel technology for dynamically tracking the growth and rising behaviors of flocs was developed based on Python-OpenCV to visually uncover the optimal structural characteristics of flocs for Microcysts aeruginosa coagulation-flotation. Different coagulation flow fields (velocity gradient, G) were adopted to artificially create flocs with various structural characteristics and floatation kinetics. Results showed that G value had significant effects on the growth and rising behaviors of flocs, thus achieving intuitively different flotation kinetics. An idea rising velocity of 91.5 m h−1 was achieved by flocs with optimal structural characteristics generated at a suitable G of 34.1 s−1, which was 29–75% higher than that of flocs at other G. The rising velocity of floc was synergistically determined by the size and fractal dimension of floc. The structural characteristics (size and fractal dimension) of flocs were introduced into the calculation model of rising velocity, which guided the principle of optimal floc structure characteristics (large and compact) suitable for Microcysts aeruginosa removal using DAF. These may provide new technology for the studies of the growth and settling/rising behaviors of flocs, and lay a theoretical foundation for the design of DAF system with high load rate and the selection of optimal operating conditions applied to cyanobacteria blooms prevention and control.

The associated research gaps regarding green fabrication, eco-friendly application, and mechanical strength improvement are worthy of systematic investigation. Herein, a newly designed lanthanum-crosslinked attapulgite/sodium alginate (La-ATP/SA) hydrogel adsorbent was prepared by an eco-friendly facile cross-linking method. The results showed that the introduction of attapulgite into sodium alginate enhanced the mechanical strength of La-ATP/SA beads. SEM images, TG tests, and stability assessment tests further verified the reinforced structure. Batch experiments demonstrated that the adsorption information was better described by the Freundlich isotherm equation and the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, harvesting more than 50% phosphate removal of the total amount within 120 min, proving that chemical adsorption dominated the sorption process. The maximum phosphate sorption capacity was 24.57 mg/g and stable phosphate removal was obtained in the presence of the commonly existing anions. The adsorption behavior was pH-dependent and efficient phosphate uptake was maintained over a wide pH range (3–9). The dominant mechanism for phosphate removal of La-ATP/SA was the inner-sphere complex mechanism. Small spherical macromolecular hydrogels can be easily recollected and display good reusability after five cycles.

This poses particular difficulties in urban environments where available land for potential solutions is limited. A promising option is the integrated fixed-film activated sludge (IFAS) process that requires only a small footprint and is capable of high total nitrogen (TN) removal through multiple pathways. In light of the sustainable development goals set out by the United Nations, the present work has sought to compare the sustainability of two TN removal pathways by comparing the technical, economic and environmental performance of their optimum configurations. Through modelling, a single-stage configuration demonstrated the capacity to achieve an effluent TN concentration of 8.7 mg/L by the simultaneous nitrification denitrification pathway when a dissolved oxygen concentration of 3.5 mg/L was provided. Addition of a post-anoxic stage at equal volume to the aerobic stage (1:1 aerobic to anoxic ratio) to target conventional nitrification denitrification could realise an effluent TN concentration of 4.2 mg/L when DO was increased to 4.5 mg/L, although 5.8 mg/L of effluent TN could be achieved with only a 5:1 ratio. In terms of environmental burden and economic costs, analysis of the system's life-cycle under these different configurations indicated considerable asymmetry of the two pathways during the operational phase due mainly to the increased aeration. However in spite of this, the two conventional configurations were ultimately both shown to be more sustainable than that of the simultaneous pathway due to the greater TN removal capacity afforded.";"2023-01-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622051939";"0";"Water Refinement"

However, the low hydrate conversion rate and sluggish hydrate formation still hinder its applicability and therefore has not been commercialized yet, as it is necessary to enhance hydrate formation kinetics and obtain more freshwater. Hence, this study introduces a dual function (thermodynamic and kinetic) promoter cyclopentane and hydrophobic graphite and investigates the effect of cyclopentane/water volume ratio from 0.05 to 0.325, graphite size (75 μ m − 1 . 6 μ m ), and graphite/water volume ratio (ranging from 0.625 mg/mL to 3.25 mg/mL) on the CO 2 + C 3 H 8 hydrate formation kinetics at 275.6 K and 2.0–3.0 MPa. The results indicated that cyclopentane could shift the hydrate phase equilibrium condition to low pressure and high temperature and accelerate CO 2 + C 3 H 8 hydrate formation. Additionally, the experimental findings highlighted that the cyclopentane/water volume ratio of 0.175 afforded a faster hydrate formation rate and water conversion to hydrate. Moreover, we demonstrated that hydrophobic graphite with a smaller size provided more sites for hydrate nucleation and growth, and the synergy of graphite and cyclopentane reduced the hydrate induction time from 8.25 (±4.42) mins to 1.95 (±1.7) mins and increased the hydrate conversion rate from 35.62 (±1.76) % to 43.25 (±0.14) %.

Herein, sewage sludge containing Fe was prepared as biochar (SSBC) for activating peroxydisulfate (PDS) to remove tetracycline (TC) in water.

Phosphate desorption and aluminum ion release from the phosphate saturated Al-biochar were less than 5% in distilled water while they were 65 and 15% in citric acid solution (2%), respectively, in 48 h. Al-biochar also showed the characteristics of slow release P fertilizer which is helpful to protect water environment from eutrophication. Al-biochar using waste KPR and Al ions extracted from water sludge was very effective in removing phosphate from wastewater. In addition, the phosphate saturated biochar showed very high potential for agricultural application as an eco-friendly P fertilizer.

"10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135468";"Preparation of iron/calcium-modified biochar for phosphate removal from industrial wastewater ";" Phosphorous pollution is one of the main factors causing water eutrophication. For the treatment of wastewater, metal-modified biochar has emerged as a promising adsorbent with enhanced affinity for anions such as phosphate. Biochar modified with Fe or Ca are suitable for the treatment of low-concentration phosphorous wastewater (<100mg/L). However, the use of modified biochar to remove high concentrations of phosphate from industrial wastewater is challenging. In this study, biochar from poplar wood, wheat bran, bagasse, and bamboo were prepared and loaded with Fe and Ca, and its adsorption performance and degradation mechanism in the presence of high phosphate concentrations were investigated. The phosphate adsorption capacity of the Fe/Ca-modified biochar was 12–70 times higher than that before the modification. The best type of biochar for phosphate removal was iron/calcium oxide-modified bamboo biochar (ZFCO-BC) through batch experiments. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) analyses showed that ZFCO-BC reacted with wastewater to produce stable vivianite (Fe3(PO4)2·(H2O)8), which did not cause secondary release. ZFCO-BC exhibited a synergistic effect on the removal of 21 metals, including Cr, Cu, Co, Cd, As, Pb, and Y, from complex polluted water. Meanwhile, after 48 h of reaction, the concentration of phosphate decreased from 1660 to 0.061 mg/L, and the final value in the wastewater was lower than the phosphate discharge index indicated by the GB T31962-2015 Sewage Discharge into Urban sewer Water Quality Standard. This study shows that a single remediation system based on ZFCO-BC can remove phosphate and multiple heavy metals from contaminated water, providing a cost-effective treatment solution for complex polluted water bodies, such as industrial wastewater and groundwater.

In this study, conceptual designs of hydrate-based dual functional plant (desalination and salt production) utilizing the eutectic crystallization of hydrate and NaCl dihydrate have been presented on an industrial scale with the capacity of 24 m3/day. The conceptual design proposed in this study focuses on detailed and executive aspects, including the size of individual reactors, the selection of pumps, and the setting of operating temperature and pressure conditions. The process designs help meet these present demands on hydrate-based desalination and conform to the global standards of minimizing energy requirement and the disposal of environmental pollutants. Hydrate-based plant was designed as a novel Zero Liquid Discharge (ZLD) process to produce potable water and salt simultaneously, with the recovery ratio of pure water from seawater achieving 95%. The design-based cost estimation showed that the annual operating cost is estimated US$2.29/m3 for cyclopentane-hydrate-based plant and US$3.64/m3 for CO2-hydrate-based plant. The results suggest that the hydrate-based plants will bring gross profit comparable to the reported ZLD plants; that is, the gross profit will achieve US$20 per 1 m3 of water production. In addition to these two improvements over the existing plants, the hydrate-based process designs also exhibit favorable energy requirement compared to the eutectic system of ice. This design-based study may contribute to the promotion of additional construction of hydrate-based process unit to the existing reverse osmosis plant or even the new construction of hydrate-based desalination plant worldwide.

Compared to systems consisting of PI alone (0.5 mM) and CuO alone (0.5 g/L), the CuO (0.5 g/L)/PI (0.5 mM) process exhibited improved degradation performance for ciprofloxacin (CIP), a widely used refractory antibacterial drug, with 98% of this pollutant (20 mg/L) removed in a reaction time of 30 min. Both radical and nonradical degradation pathways were identified to play a significant role in the developed CuO/PI system, where the nonradical pathway (holes and electrons) played the most important role in the degradation of CIP. Under both acidic (pH = 3) and near-neutral (pH = 6) conditions, the system showed an improved efficiency for the degradation of CIP in comparison with alkaline conditions (pH = 10). This was attributed to a more facile adsorption of the PI ions onto the surface of the CuO nanoparticles, induced by the electrostatic attraction between the PI ions and the CuO nanomaterial. Analysis of the degraded samples with ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC Q-TOF MS) demonstrated that cleavage of the piperazine ring and defluorination were the primary degradation pathways of CIP under this oxidation process. The CuO/PI system also showed an excellent removal efficiency for other refractory organic contaminants, such as sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and methylene blue (MB), in various water matrices, including real wastewater. Moreover, respiration tests revealed that the toxicity of the effluents was reduced after the treatment process.

Most nutrients in household wastewater originate from urine and one way to facilitate reuse of these nutrients is to concentrate the urine into fertiliser products. Urine concentration technologies are still in the development phase and not implemented at scale. The aim of this study was to provide guidance to technology developers and policymakers by assessing the environmental and societal impacts of urine concentration technologies. In particular, it includes practical aspects such as worker safety, space availability and local fertiliser needs that have not been included in previous studies. Future scenarios on implementing three different urine concentration technologies (alkaline dehydration, nitrification-distillation, ion-exchange with struvite precipitation) in a planned residential area in Malmö, Sweden, were developed. The technologies were evaluated using multi-criteria assessment (MCA), with environment, technical, economic and health sustainability criteria derived from the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It was found that all urine concentration technologies performed well against many of the sustainability criteria examined and can contribute to achieving SDGs, especially regarding nitrogen recovery. Specific areas for further development were identified for each technology. An impact assessment on scaling up demonstrated that nitrogen emissions to surface water were significantly reduced when more than 60% of urine in Malmö city was subjected to urine concentration.

In this study, magnetic Cu–Ni–S@Ni foam was synthesized by liquid phase vulcanization method to in-situ load Cu–Ni–S nanostructures on the surface of Ni foam. The novelty of this material is the combination of adsorption-flocculation technology and semi-quantitative detection technology. Batch experiments showed that Cu–Ni–S@Ni foam has a high removal rate of norfloxacin (NOR) (96.92%), wide pH adaptability (pH = 4.0–10.0) and strong ion interference resistance (0.1–100 mmol/L).

Characterization analysis indicated that the main removal mechanisms are surface complexation, cation bridging, electrostatic attraction, precipitation and flocculation. Transmission FTIR detection experiments showed that NOR on Cu–Ni–S@Ni foam has easily recognizable FTIR fingerprints; the intensity of characteristic peaks roughly reflects the concentration information of NOR to some extent. This semi-quantitative detection method, requiring simple operation without the fabrication of KBr tablet, has a wide linear range (5–100 mg/L) and a low limit of detection (4.6 mg/L).

When the current density was 20 mA/cm2, the removal ratios of Ni2+, NH4 +, TP and NO3 − were 100%, 98.6%, 99.3% and 100% after 14 h, respectively, and their recovery ratios were 92.6%, 75.5%, 94.5% and 90.6%, respectively. The removal kinetics analysis showed that the removal of Ni2+, NH4 +, TP and NO3 − was consistent with the zero-order kinetics process. The current efficiency variated from 42.5% to 39.0% and 37.7%, and the specific energy consumption decreased from 1.67 to 1.38 and 1.32 kW h/mol with the equipped wastewater compartments increased from one to two and three in a BMED system. Post treatment, Ni2+ was recovered as Ni(OH)2, with a purity of 82.6% (commercial Ni(OH)2 purity = 90%). TP was recovered as struvite with a purity of 95.3%, and the physicochemical properties of the obtained struvite were similar to commercial struvite. NH4 + was recovered as (NH4)2SO4 and NH3•H2O. Therefore, BMED is an effective method to recover Ni2+, TP and NH4 + from ENP wastewater. ";"2023-01-01";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652622049009";"22";"Water Refinement"
"10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139145";"Multi-stakeholder perspectives for transport electrification: A review on placement and scheduling of electric vehicle charging infrastructure";"In promoting transport electrification, addressing diverse stakeholder needs is vital for a balanced approach to placing and scheduling Electric Vehicle Charging Stations (EVCS). This paper highlights stakeholder-centric challenges for implementing and scheduling public charging infrastructures. To account for stakeholders' perspectives, it investigates the significance of assigning variable weightage to different stakeholders in optimizing the placement and scheduling of charging stations. This paper examines stakeholder priorities by selecting various features and assessing each stakeholder's contribution to those features in the context of placement and scheduling challenges. By analyzing relevant case studies focusing on stakeholder engagement, charger types, studied networks, and installation locations, this study presents multi-stakeholder-driven optimal allocation and scheduling strategies for charging infrastructures and practical implications. The findings reveal a predominant focus on distribution networks and EVCS owners in placement and scheduling strategies, with limited attention to other stakeholders. Also, around 80 percent of recent studies emphasize urban and highway networks, often validated in test networks, highlighting the need for real network validation, particularly in suburban and remote areas. Furthermore, the paper explores future perspectives on EVCS placement and scheduling, offering valuable insights to policymakers, industry professionals, and researchers addressing emerging research issues in transport decarbonization.";"2023-11-15";"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959652623033036";"14";"undefined"
